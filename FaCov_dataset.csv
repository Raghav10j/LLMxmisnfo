0,Trump Overstates Status of COVID-19 Antibody Drugs,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-overstates-status-of-covid-19-antibody-drugs/,,"Calling investigational COVID-19 antibody drugs “cures” in a video posted to Twitter, President Donald Trump incorrectly said the therapies had been authorized and that “hundreds of thousands of doses” were nearly ready.
He also suggested he had personally benefited from an antibody cocktail made by the biotech company Regeneron. It was one of several drugs the president received since he tested positive for the coronavirus.
The president later undercut that message, claiming in a subsequent interview that he “would’ve done it fine with no drugs,” but iterated that the drugs had cured him in another video.
The drugs in question are monoclonal antibodies, which are synthetic proteins optimized to recognize the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and in theory should help clear the virus from the body. While many experts view them as promising — and some early data support that enthusiasm — the products are still in clinical trials and have not been proven to be effective for COVID-19 patients, much less cure the disease.
Trump’s Video 
In the first video, which was posted to Twitter on Oct. 7, Trump praised the effects of the Regeneron antibody cocktail he received prior to being admitted on Oct. 2 to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a three-day stay.
“I went in and I wasn’t feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron,” Trump said, incorrectly referring to the cocktail by the company’s name and contradicting his physician on being given the drug at the White House. “It’s called Regeneron, and other things too. But I think this was the key, but they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now.”
The president proceeded to note that another company is also behind a similar drug, and confusingly said both that the drugs had been authorized and that he was trying to help in that process.
Trump, Oct. 7: We have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they’re coming out and we’re trying to get them on an emergency basis. We’ve authorized it. I’ve authorized it. And if you’re in the hospital and you’re feeling really bad, I think we’re going to work it so that you get them and you’re going to get them free, and especially if you’re a senior, we’re going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you’re going to get better. You’re going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. … I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me it wasn’t therapeutic, it just made me better. OK, I call that a cure. So I want to get these things done. So we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly.
In fact, as of Oct. 8, no monoclonal antibody for COVID-19 has received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, although two companies have submitted those applications. 
Regeneron announced its submission for REGN-COV2, its dual antibody cocktail, hours after Trump’s video landed on Twitter on Oct. 7. Eli Lilly announced a submission for its single-antibody drug earlier the same day; the company said it expected to apply for an EUA for its combination antibody in November, “pending clinical trial enrollment, once additional safety data accumulate and sufficient supply is manufactured.”
The president should have no involvement in whether the FDA issues an EUA, as that decision is supposed to be up to career scientists at the agency.
Trump later emphasized his own experience once again, calling the antibody cocktail “a cure” and saying that his contracting of the coronavirus was “a blessing from God.”
“Some people don’t know how to define therapeutic. I view it different, it’s a cure,” he said. “For me, I walked in, I didn’t feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I wanted to get out of the hospital and that’s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great.”
“I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it,” he added. “This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it. I heard about this drug. I said, ‘Let me take it.’ It was my suggestion. I said, ‘Let me take it,’ and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. I think if I didn’t catch it, we’d be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job.”
Trump acknowledged his unique position as president to receive investigational drugs that are unavailable to nearly all other Americans. According to STAT News, at the time Trump received his dose of the Regeneron cocktail, fewer than 10 patients had been provided the cocktail outside of its trials. 
Trump also gave a misleading impression of how available the antibody cocktails would be, should they receive FDA authorization. Along with his figure of “hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready,” Trump said near the end of the video that “the drug companies have just made a lot of it.”
And in a follow-up video posted to the president’s Twitter account on Oct. 8, but filmed the day before, Trump addressed America’s seniors, repeating his claims that the antibodies are “a cure” and saying the drugs were going to be available “immediately.”
The companies have not provided such optimistic figures. Regeneron said on Oct. 7 that at the moment, it has enough doses to treat “approximately 50,000 patients” and expects to have enough for 250,000 more “within the next few months.” Eli Lily estimates that for its single antibody, it will have 100,000 doses in October, with up to 1 million doses by the end of the year.
That would suggest that at most, only about 150,000 doses of these drugs would be immediately available with the potentially forthcoming EUAs.
In both videos, Trump also promised the monoclonal antibodies would be free to the public, saying in the second, “We’re going to take care of our seniors all free.” There are plans in place for some of the initial doses to be free, but it’s unclear how long that will last.
The U.S. government signed a deal with Regeneron in July to produce a fixed number of lots of its cocktail at government expense, which would be provided to Americans at no cost. The exact number of doses those lots will yield depends on the dosage that the trials determine is safe and effective, but could range from between 70,000 to 300,000 treatment doses. After that, there is no guarantee the drugs would be free and patients at all times could be charged for being administered the therapy.
Production of monoclonal antibodies is not trivial and isn’t easily scaled up, so there is concern that supplies of the therapies will not be able to meet demand. 
“Antibody drugs will be critical bridge to Covid vaccine, but supply is very limited,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA chief under Trump, said in an Oct. 7 tweet. “We needed to pay companies to convert existing manufacturing and stop production of some drugs to free space for these – and didn’t. It’s not too late.”
In another tweet, Gottlieb demonstrated how limited even 300,000 doses might be, calculating that it would be enough to treat all Americans over the age of 65 who are infected with the virus for only a bit more than a month. “About 15% of Covid cases diagnosed each day are over 65. Based on that age criteria alone, >7,500 patients per day could be indicated for this drug, 225K per month,” he said. “We need more supply, which may not be possible now for 2020, but could be available in 2021 if we take right steps.”
Both Eli Lily and Regeneron have teamed up with other companies to increase output.
A ‘Cure’?
As for whether Trump benefited from Regeneron’s cocktail, that’s impossible to know. Only through clinical trials is it possible to know if the drugs are safe and effective, and even then, it’s uncertain how much any particular therapy will help an individual.
As Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Oct. 8 interview on MSNBC, it’s not even clear that Trump has fully beaten the coronavirus yet.
“One of the issues that we all have to be aware — and his physicians are aware of this — that the history of COVID-19 is that you could look and feel like you’re doing reasonably well, and after a couple of days you could have a downturn, namely have a reversal,” he said. “That’s possible. The chances of that happening, I don’t know. As good as he looks, I don’t think that’s going to happen, but I don’t know. But you have to be heads up that it might happen.”
Fauci also cautioned against coming to premature conclusions about the effectiveness of the antibodies, although he said he thought it was likely that they did help the president.
“The preliminary data from those antibodies are favorable. I think it’s a reasonably good chance that the antibody that he received, the Regeneron antibody, made a significant difference in a positive way in his course,” he said. “But when you have only one, we refer to it in medicine as N equals 1, when you have only one, you can’t make the determination that that’s a cure. You have to do a clinical trial involving a large number of individuals compared either to a placebo or another intervention.”
Other physicians are not so sure the antibody cocktail is responsible for his condition — at least not at the speed that he claims — and point out that Trump was also given other drugs, namely the antiviral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.
Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the New York Times that there was no chance the cocktail “cured” Trump in 24 hours, and suspected the president might be feeling so good because of the dexamethasone. 
Of course, Trump also might not have needed any of the medications, as most COVID-19 patients recover without them.
The existing data on the various monoclonal antibodies is generally positive, but are hardly conclusive at this point — and do not point to a “cure” for all patients.
Regeneron announced preliminary results from its first 275 patients in a Sept. 29 press release, saying that its dual antibody “reduced viral load and the time to alleviate symptoms in non-hospitalized patients.”
Notably, the company said it saw differences in the impact of the cocktail in patients who were given the cocktail early versus late in their disease courses. Those who had already developed antibodies on their own saw less of an improvement compared to controls, suggesting that for the drug to be most effective, it would have to be delivered shortly after a rapid diagnosis.
Eli Lilly also released interim results on Oct. 7 for its two-antibody cocktail, finding the combo reduced the viral load as early as three days after treatment in COVID-19 outpatients. The drug also reduced symptoms and hospitalizations and ER visits, with 0.9% of treated patients entering a hospital compared with 5.8% of those getting the placebo. The latter result, however, barely reached statistical significance, given the small size of the study.
But the antibody cocktail isn’t the drug Eli Lilly is moving forward with first. The one the company submitted for its EUA, which targets higher-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, is for just one of the two antibodies.
The data on the single antibody treatment is slightly less impressive, with only the highest dose of the antibody showing a decrease in the viral load after 11 days in a phase 2 trial. Across the three doses tested, there was a drop in the rate of hospitalization or ER visits compared with controls — 1.7% versus 6% — which was based on just 14 such events.
The results for both companies reflect the outcomes of only several hundred patients and have not been published in peer-reviewed journals.
Many experts, such as Fauci, are optimistic. But it’s premature to claim that the COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies are safe and effective before the trial results are in, as Trump did in his second video, when he called the therapy “totally safe”  but “powerful against this disease,” or to brand them cures. ",Jessica McDonald,2020-10-08 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Along with his figure of “hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready,” Trump said near the end of the video that “the drug companies have just made a lot of it.”
And in a follow-up video posted to the president’s Twitter account on Oct. 8, but filmed the day before, Trump addressed America’s seniors, repeating his claims that the antibodies are “a cure” and saying the drugs were going to be available “immediately.”
The companies have not provided such optimistic figures. And if you’re in the hospital and you’re feeling really bad, I think we’re going to work it so that you get them and you’re going to get them free, and especially if you’re a senior, we’re going to get you in there quick.

1,"Trump Misleads on Hydroxychloroquine, Again",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-misleads-on-hydroxychloroquine-again/,,"In announcing that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19, President Donald Trump made a series of inaccurate, unsubstantiated or misleading statements related to the drug, which remains an unproven treatment against the coronavirus:
Trump said he started taking hydroxychloroquine because he thinks “it’s good” and has “heard a lot of good stories.” But there is no published data showing that the medication protects against infection with the coronavirus, and experts recommend such use only within clinical trials.
As part of his justification for taking hydroxychloroquine, the president repeatedly said that “many” frontline workers take the drug for COVID-19 prevention. It’s unclear how many people do take the drug for prevention, or prophylaxis, but several physicians told us they were not aware of the practice at their institutions.
Trump insisted that there only has been one “bad survey” of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. That’s false. Numerous studies, including the best evidence to date, do not suggest that hydroxychloroquine is beneficial for COVID-19 patients.
The president called an unpublished study that used Veterans Affairs data and found no benefit to using hydroxychloroquine “phony” and “false,” and accused the authors of being politically motivated. There is no evidence of political bias, and while the study has not been peer-reviewed, its results are consistent with other published papers.
Trump was also not transparent about the safety risks of hydroxychloroquine, saying “it doesn’t hurt people” and “you’re not going to get sick or die.” While severe side effects of the drug are rare, they have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration.
Trump claimed Rick Bright, former director of the agency charged with overseeing the production and purchase of drugs to counter public health threats, must have been “a believer at one point” in hydroxychloroquine because he “signed the application” for emergency use of the drug. Bright, however, said he did so under pressure and “didn’t have a choice.”

The president has long touted hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as a COVID-19 treatment, despite a lack of evidence that it’s safe and effective for the disease. 
In recent weeks, Trump had backed off his promotion of the drug, as a string of studies have detailed uncommon but potentially serious side effects and failed to find that the medication is doing much for patients.
Guidelines from the National Institutes of Health, last updated on May 12, find “insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against” the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, while the FDA has cautioned against the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside of hospitals or clinical trials, given the risk of dangerous heart rhythm problems.
But at the end of a May 18 meeting with representatives of the restaurant industry at the White House, Trump surprised reporters by claiming that he had been taking a hydroxychloroquine pill each day for the last week and a half as a preventive, or prophylactic, measure.
“A couple of weeks ago, I started taking it,” he said. “Because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you right — you know, I’m not going to get hurt by it.”
When asked if his doctor had recommended it, Trump said he proposed the idea and the White House doctor agreed.
Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, released a memo later that night, noting that two weeks prior, a member of Trump’s support staff tested positive for COVID-19, and that after “numerous discussions” about hydroxychloroquine with the president, the pair “concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.” 
The memo did not reveal any details of Trump’s course of prophylaxis, nor did it explicitly state that Conley prescribed hydroxychloroquine for the president.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, however, told CBN News in an interview two days later that Conley prescribed the drug, and Trump had taken it. 
On May 20, Trump said that he would be ending the pills “in a day or two.”
No Evidence Hydroxychloroquine Prevents COVID-19
While Trump may believe hydroxychloroquine is “good,” it’s not known if the drug works as a COVID-19 preventive.
“There are no data that pre-exposure prophylaxis is effective to prevent coronavirus,” said University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware in a tweet shortly after Trump’s announcement. “It may be. It may not be. We do not know.” 
He added, “The only way I would recommend taking #hydroxychloroquine is within a clinical trial.”
Boulware is leading a clinical trial that aims to find out if hydroxychloroquine prevents COVID-19 after a person has been exposed, or what’s called post-exposure prophylaxis. Other colleagues are working on prevention prior to exposure, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
Boulware told us in an email that there is no published data on hydroxychloroquine for either kind of prophylaxis, although many researchers are looking into it.
“There are approximately a dozen trials planned or active worldwide which are investigating this question,” he said, noting that his university would be the first to report results, with the post-exposure findings coming very soon.
Update, June 3: Boulware’s trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3, found that giving hydroxychloroquine within four days of exposure did not prevent COVID-19. The study included 821 participants and tested hydroxychloroquine against a placebo.
Boulware did not think anyone should take hydroxychloroquine outside of a clinical trial, both for the sake of the trials — so scientists can actually determine whether it works — and for safety reasons.
“The more people participate in a clinical trial, the faster we will know the answer,” he said. “Outside of a clinical trial, there could be groups who are harmed by the medicine, such as those with pre-existing heart conditions.”
Dr. H. Michael Belmont, a rheumatologist running a hydroxychloroquine pre-exposure prophylaxis trial at New York University Langone Health, also said hydroxychloroquine should only be used within a clinical trial.
“We would regret using it in a haphazard way and not being able to conclude whether it had any benefit,” he said. “If you just use it indiscriminately, without a controlled group, you will lose the opportunity to demonstrate, once and for all, whether it did have some benefit or whether it did not.”
Belmont was also concerned that increased interest in hydroxychloroquine outside of a trial could pose problems for his rheumatic disease patients. “I don’t want there to be another run on the drug,” he said, “creating unnecessary shortages for those diseases for which the drug is FDA-approved and clinical trials clearly demonstrate a benefit.”
Belmont said his trial, which is still enrolling health care workers, has 45 to 60 more days to go, plus extra time for data analysis, so the results won’t be known for some time.
Within a month, though, he said he may have some preliminary answers about how protective hydroxychloroquine might be through a different study he’s doing on lupus patients, in which he will assess whether patients who are taking hydroxychloroquine for their disease are any less susceptible to developing COVID-19 than those who aren’t.
Already, he said, it’s clear that hydroxychloroquine isn’t 100% protective, although he stressed there could still be a partial effect.
“We can absolutely confirm at NYU that lupus patients on hydroxychloroquine do develop infection, he said. “Sadly, we’re aware of at least two fatal cases.”
Those results mirror those of the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance’s patient registry, which we previously reported on when Trump falsely claimed in early April that “people with lupus” who take hydroxychloroquine “aren’t catching this horrible virus.”
The group has since published a paper in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases reporting that as of April 17, the registry included 80 COVID-19 patients with lupus, 64% of whom were taking hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine prior to infection, with no difference in hospitalization rates or advanced care, such as ventilation, for those on versus off the drug.
Use of Hydroxychloroquine Among Frontline Workers
One of Trump’s constant refrains surrounding hydroxychloroquine is that the drug is being widely used by doctors and other frontline workers for COVID-19 prevention.
“You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers,” Trump said, just before announcing he was taking it, too. “A lot of doctors take it,” he later said twice.
The following day, Trump claimed in a cabinet meeting that the drug “is used by thousands and thousands of frontline workers,” and in remarks to the press after a policy lunch, Trump went so far as to say, “Many frontline workers won’t go there unless they have the hydroxy.”
We cannot know what all workers are doing, and there are now numerous clinical trials for health care workers to determine if hydroxychloroquine is an effective preventive. But several physicians told us that they did not know of many fellow health care workers who were taking the drug.
Dr. Bob Wachter, the chair of the University of California, San Francisco’s department of medicine, said he didn’t know of “any clinician” taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19.
The University of Minnesota’s Boulware also said he didn’t know of “any colleagues” who were taking the drug outside of a clinical trial, although he acknowledged that he was at an academic medical center “where doctors believe in data.”
Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University, likewise said he had not heard of workers taking hydroxychloroquine, and that at his medical center, the drug would only be used in a clinical trial.
Belmont said that back in March, when hydroxychloroquine was first being put forward and New York City was experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, he thought there might be a few physicians seeking out the drug. But he did not believe it could be happening much after New York state instituted an executive order putting restrictions on hydroxychloroquine prescribing.
Not Just One ‘Bad’ Study
In defending hydroxychloroquine, Trump repeatedly claimed there was only one negative study of the drug, despite the fact that the bulk of the current evidence fails to show effectiveness against COVID-19. He also mischaracterized the study and stated, without evidence, that the authors of the paper were politically motivated.
“And if you look at that phony report that was put in, that report on the hydroxy — was given to people that were in extraordinarily bad condition — extraordinarily bad, people that were dying,” Trump said. “The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? With, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it,” he added, later calling the study a “very unscientific report.”
The following day, Trump made similar comments, although he didn’t specify the study. “And if you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead,” he said. “It was a ‘Trump enemy’ statement.”
An hour later, in a cabinet meeting, Trump returned to the same topic, identifying the study as “a phony study put out by the VA.”
Trump, May 19: There was a false study done where they gave it to very sick people — extremely sick people, people that were ready to die. It was given by, obviously, not friends of the administration. And the study came out. The people were ready to die. Everybody was old, had bad problems with hearts, diabetes, and everything else you can imagine. So they gave it.  So, immediately, when it came out, they gave a lot of false information, just so you understand.
Much of the president’s description of the study, which was posted to the preprint server medRxiv on April 21 and has not yet been peer-reviewed, isn’t accurate. But even more important, it’s largely irrelevant because subsequent studies reaching similar conclusions about hydroxychloroquine have been published in highly respected journals.
“The general conclusions of the study are consistent with other larger studies that have gone through peer review and that have been published in very reputable journals,” said Schluger, himself the senior author of one such paper, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The preprint Trump singled out analyzed the outcomes of 368 patients hospitalized at VA medical centers for COVID-19, looking back after the fact and comparing what happened to those who took hydroxychloroquine with those not on the drug, as well as those who took hydroxychloroquine together with the antibiotic azithromycin.
After adjusting for as many factors as possible, including existing health conditions — almost none of which were more common in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine — the authors found an association of increased overall mortality in the patients who took hydroxychloroquine alone, and no evidence that hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, helped patients avoid ventilators.
The authors, who have affiliations at the University of South Carolina and the University of Virginia, were upfront that their study should not be the final word on hydroxychloroquine, writing: “Data from ongoing, randomized controlled studies will prove informative when they emerge. Until then, the findings from this retrospective study suggest caution in using hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized Covid-19 patients.” We reached out to the corresponding authors, but did not hear from them.
While the patients were sick enough to be hospitalized, 80% of all patients survived, Schluger said, “so it’s not like they were all on death’s door and you were giving this medicine all to hopelessly ill patients.” That was also true of his study and of another similar large observational study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, he said.
Those two studies, plus two recent publications in the journal BMJ, Schluger suggested, should be the studies people are paying attention to, although he said the preprint using the VA data “looks like a pretty solid piece of work,” and appeared to be “a straightforward analysis of what they found.”
Schluger’s study assessed more than 1,400 hospitalized patients in New York City, finding “the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower among patients who received hydroxychloroquine than among those who did not.”
The JAMA study, which included around the same number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York state, similarly concluded that “treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both was not associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality.”
“There you have two studies that between them report data on almost 3,000 patients, and concluded that they could find no association between hydroxychloroquine administration and the outcome that was looked at — death, or [the] need to be on a ventilator,” Schluger said.
Additionally, two studies published in BMJ earlier this month do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. One, a randomized controlled trial of 150 patients hospitalized with mild to moderate disease in China, did not find the drug helped reduce the chance that patients would test positive for the virus within 28 days — and patients receiving hydroxychloroquine reported more side effects, although most were minor. 
The other, an observational study in France of around 180 patients who were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia and required oxygen, found no associated reduction in death or transfer to an intensive care unit with the use of hydroxychloroquine. Eight patients, or 10% of those getting the drug, experienced changes on their electrocardiograms, or EKGs, that required them to discontinue the medication.
Thus, while Trump claims “a lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy,” that’s hardly an accurate representation of the existing literature.
“The overwhelming majority of published studies provides very little evidence or almost no evidence of a beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine,” said Schluger.
To be clear, it has not been proven that hydroxychloroquine provides no benefit to COVID-19 patients. But as Belmont told us, “There’s enough data to argue that if there is a benefit for active treatment, it would be mild or modest at best.”
Large randomized controlled trials, which are underway, will be able to give a definitive answer.
Safety Omissions
When discussing hydroxychloroquine, Trump has repeatedly avoided any mention of potential harms, despite widely disseminated concerns from the FDA and other governmental agencies.
Citing hydroxychloroquine’s long history as a malaria and lupus drug, Trump said on May 18 that even if it doesn’t work for COVID-19, “you’re not going to get sick or die,” and asked, as he has before, “What do you have to lose?”
The following day, the president said hydroxychloroquine “doesn’t hurt people.” And when he was told the FDA has said the drug should not be used outside of a hospital or research study, he replied, “No, that’s not what I was told. No.”
Trump may not have been told, but that is exactly what the FDA has advised. On April 24, the agency released a drug safety communication, saying it is “aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin,” and that it “cautions against” the use of the drugs “for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial.”
Specifically, the FDA said the adverse events “included abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation, dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and in some cases, death.”
Schluger said the concern is that a potentially lethal arrhythmia that would cause the heart to beat in a way that it doesn’t pump blood. It would present as sudden death — “someone literally would just drop dead,” he said.
It is true that this complication is rare, and most people who take low doses of hydroxychloroquine, such as lupus patients, have no major issues when taking the drug. Belmont, for instance, said that he does not regularly screen his rheumatoid patients for heart rhythm abnormalities with an EKG because the problem is so infrequent. But that doesn’t mean the drug is risk free, as Trump frequently suggests.
Notably, the FDA’s emergency use authorization, or EUA, for hydroxychloroquine only covers hospitalized COVID-19 patients “for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible.” This means that while hydroxychloroquine can still be prescribed off-label by a physician, as it appears was done for Trump, the president would not be eligible to get his tablets from the national stockpile. 
Trump’s Attacks on Rick Bright
At a May 14 House hearing, Rick Bright said he was removed as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, because he “resisted efforts to promote and enable broad access to an unproven drug, chloroquine, to the American people without transparent information on the potential health risks.”
Trump has sought to portray the former BARDA director as a hypocrite because Bright signed the emergency use authorization application to allow the use of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to treat COVID-19 in the United States.
But Bright said he did so only as a compromise measure to avert the much wider use of the controversial drug being vigorously pushed by his superiors in the Trump administration. We asked the White House to respond to Bright’s assertion and his account of what had taken place, and we received no response.
Trump attacked Bright at the May 18 roundtable with restaurant industry leaders at the White House.
Trump, May 18: So you had a phony whistleblower. And this other guy with the hydroxychloroquine — okay? — well, he — he went out and he’s the one that approved the hydroxychloroquine. He’s the one that signed the application.
At the same session, Trump repeated the point.
Trump, May 18: And then we have this crazy whistleblower, this fake whistleblower get out and try and, you know, knock it, who is — who signed the application. He — he did all the — he did the signing. He was a believer at one point, I assume. Otherwise, he shouldn’t have signed it. No matter who told him to, he shouldn’t have signed it.
That same day, the president tweeted: “So the so-called HHS Whistleblower was against HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE. Then why did he make, and sign, an emergency use authorization?”
During a May 17 interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Bright said emphatically that he did not share Trump’s view that hydroxychloroquine could be a “game-changer” in the battle against the novel coronavirus. The vaccine expert said that “the limited data available told us that it could be dangerous. It could have negative side effects. And it could even lead to death.”
Interviewer Norah O’Donnell asked Bright why, given his concerns about the drug, he had signed the EUA application. Referring to his efforts to prevent far wider use than such an order allowed, Bright responded, “I was given a directive. I didn’t have a choice, other than to leave at that time. And I went along and signed that letter knowing that we had contained access to that drug. ”
Bright was transferred April 20 from his position as BARDA director and removed as deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response. He was given a lesser position at the National Institutes of Health. 
In a statement issued on April 22, Bright said, “I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit. I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science — not politics or cronyism — has to lead the way.”
Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar pushed back. Speaking outside the White House before a trip to Pennsylvania on May 14, Trump dismissed Bright as a “really disgruntled, unhappy person.” Azar said: “And on hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Bright literally signed the application for an FDA authorization of it. Literally, he’s the sponsor of it. So, this just — his allegations do not hold water. They do not hold water.”
In a whistleblower complaint, Bright, who has said that the administration was too slow in responding to the pandemic, gave a detailed account of what he said were his efforts to resist massive pressure to greenlight the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19.
Bright’s complaint, May 5: Dr. Bright resisted efforts to fall into line with the Administration’s directive to promote the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and to award lucrative contracts for these and other drugs even though they lacked scientific merit and had not received prior scientific vetting. Dr. Bright’s refusal to do so, along with his communication with members of Congress, the White House, and the press about these issues, which revealed HHS leadership to be disengaged and dismissive of the emerging threat, proved to be Dr. Bright’s undoing.
In March, Bayer offered to donate 3 million chloroquine pills to the Strategic National Stockpile, Bright said in his complaint. “Unfortunately,” the complaint says, “the scientific evaluations did not support the utility of the Bayer donations.”
On March 23, according to the complaint, “Dr. Bright received an urgent directive from HHS General Counsel Bob Charrow, passed down from the White House, to drop everything and make the chloroquine donated by Bayer widely available to the American public. Mr. Charrow told Dr. Bright that Secretary Azar was directing BARDA to establish a Nationwide Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol for chloroquine, which would provide significantly greater access to the drug than would an EUA.”
The broader measure would allow use of the drug “outside a hospital setting and without close physician supervision,” the complaint said.
The following day, the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Dr. Janet Woodcock, called Bright and strongly recommended that BARDA submit an application for an EUA instead of an expanded access protocol. Given the concerns about hydroxychloroquine, that approach would allow closer monitoring of and better protection for patients.
Bright and Woodcock ultimately convinced their colleagues, and the FDA helped BARDA draft an EUA. Bright edited the request letter to clarify that although he was being directed to sign the EUA request, it was not at his or BARDA’s behest, according to the complaint.
At the same roundtable with restaurant industry leaders, Trump suggested that Bright might have partisan motives for his criticism of the administration and hydroxychloroquine.
Trump, May 18: He also happens to be — if you look — see whether or not — I won’t put it on me; I’ll put it on you. See whether or not he was a big contributor to the Democrats. See whether or not he wanted the Democrats to win. 
A search of Federal Election Commission data on OpenSecrets.org showed no evidence that Bright had made any contributions to Democrats.
Update, June 3: We initially updated the story to include an observational study of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients published in the Lancet on May 22. But because of methodological and data integrity concerns raised after publication, we removed mention of the study from the story.",Jessica McDonald,2020-05-21 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Citing hydroxychloroquine’s long history as a malaria and lupus drug, Trump said on May 18 that even if it doesn’t work for COVID-19, “you’re not going to get sick or die,” and asked, as he has before, “What do you have to lose?”
The following day, the president said hydroxychloroquine “doesn’t hurt people.” And when he was told the FDA has said the drug should not be used outside of a hospital or research study, he replied, “No, that’s not what I was told. Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, released a memo later that night, noting that two weeks prior, a member of Trump’s support staff tested positive for COVID-19, and that after “numerous discussions” about hydroxychloroquine with the president, the pair “concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.” 
The memo did not reveal any details of Trump’s course of prophylaxis, nor did it explicitly state that Conley prescribed hydroxychloroquine for the president. “I don’t want there to be another run on the drug,” he said, “creating unnecessary shortages for those diseases for which the drug is FDA-approved and clinical trials clearly demonstrate a benefit.”
Belmont said his trial, which is still enrolling health care workers, has 45 to 60 more days to go, plus extra time for data analysis, so the results won’t be known for some time. The University of Minnesota’s Boulware also said he didn’t know of “any colleagues” who were taking the drug outside of a clinical trial, although he acknowledged that he was at an academic medical center “where doctors believe in data.”
Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University, likewise said he had not heard of workers taking hydroxychloroquine, and that at his medical center, the drug would only be used in a clinical trial. Notably, the FDA’s emergency use authorization, or EUA, for hydroxychloroquine only covers hospitalized COVID-19 patients “for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible.” This means that while hydroxychloroquine can still be prescribed off-label by a physician, as it appears was done for Trump, the president would not be eligible to get his tablets from the national stockpile."
2,"New ‘Plandemic’ Video Peddles Misinformation, Conspiracies",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/new-plandemic-video-peddles-misinformation-conspiracies/,,"The second part of “Plandemic” — a documentary-style video that presents a sweeping conspiracy theory about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, patents and vaccines — landed on Aug. 18, spinning together many of the falsehoods about the disease that we’ve been debunking for months, plus some new misleading claims.
The 75-minute video expands on the first installment, which captured widespread attention in early May. At the time, much of the U.S. was under various stay-at-home orders in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus about two months after the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a pandemic. The first installment spread a number of false and misleading claims made by Judy Mikovits, a researcher known for her discredited work on chronic fatigue syndrome.
The new video, called “Plandemic: Indoctornation,” offers a more far-reaching conspiratorial take on the pandemic, with an underlying theme that the media can’t be trusted. It suggests without proof that the novel coronavirus was man-made and intentionally released.
The video is heavy on innuendo and features David Martin, a financial analyst and self-help entrepreneur who has a YouTube channel that has pushed some of the same conspiracy theories.
The first installment spread largely on major social media platforms, but many of them — including Facebook and YouTube — removed it for violating policies against harmful misinformation. Filmmaker Mikki Willis — a former model who has claimed on his YouTube channel that the novel coronavirus was “intentionally released” — has capitalized on that fact, telling viewers in a promotional video that it was “the most banned documentary of all time.”
The sequel has been released on two video-hosting websites that bill themselves as being against “censorship,” promising to allow all videos to stay online, regardless of the claims they make. But each site includes a clause in the terms and conditions that allows them to remove content, similar to Facebook and YouTube.
So far, both sites appear to offer only videos uploaded by their creators — Brian Rose, who sells online self-help videos and promotes conspiracy theorists in England, and Ben Swann, an Atlanta-based content creator who is affiliated with the Russia-based, government-funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today. Swann has made other videos pushing conspiracy theories.
Promotion for the video was done largely on major social media platforms, though, where links to the video have been shared on pages with a combined following of more than 3 million, according to data from CrowdTangle.
We’ll address some of the major claims in the sections below:

The Event 201 Conspiracy Theory
The video devotes considerable attention to Event 201 — a tabletop preparedness exercise held in October 2019, before reports of the novel coronavirus in China surfaced in December. The event was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and World Economic Forum. We’ve written about it before — and information on the event, including videos, are publicly available.
The exercise brought together stakeholders from various sectors, including business and government, to simulate a “severe pandemic” involving a fictional coronavirus, with an outbreak beginning in Brazil.
The “Plandemic” video suggests a nefarious motive behind Event 201 and implies it is evidence for the video’s theory that the pandemic was planned. “Nature conveniently backs itself into our architecture,” Martin says. “That’s the scenario we’re supposed to accept.”
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses, and experts have known of the pandemic threat posed by coronaviruses for years. So it’s not surprising to those who study such outbreaks that a preparedness exercise would have centered on a coronavirus.
Dr. Donald Burke, the Jonas Salk chair in population health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh, in a 1998 article discussing prevention of viral pandemics, warned that coronaviruses were among those that “should be considered as serious threats to human health. These are viruses with high evolvability and proven ability to cause epidemics in animal populations.”
Burke, who at the time was a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, looked at how viruses jumped between animal species and how they evolve, among other factors. “Coronaviruses had all the right tools in the tool kit” to trigger a pandemic, Burke told us in a phone interview.
He was proven correct in 2003 by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
SARS is caused by another type of coronavirus, which, importantly, is different from the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Several different human viruses are included in the coronavirus group, ranging from those that cause the common cold to those that cause more severe illnesses, like SARS and COVID-19.
Burke said after the outbreak, infectious disease researchers — knowing that SARS could have been worse if it had been more transmissible — further recognized the threat presented by coronaviruses.
It’s “downright sensible” to have held preparation exercises on a potential coronavirus pandemic, he said. “If you’re concerned about epidemic diseases, coronaviruses need to be high on your list — and thinking through what a coronavirus epidemic might look like.”
Dr. Eric Toner, senior scholar and senior scientist at the Center for Health Security, told us in a phone interview that the center “chose coronavirus because it would be one of the believable pathogens other than flu.” He cited examples of other actual coronaviruses, like those that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
The center has been hosting such exercises for nearly 20 years, he noted. In 2001, it hosted “Dark Winter,” which simulated a smallpox attack on U.S. citizens. In 2005, the center held “Atlantic Storm,” which involved a trans-Atlantic bioterrorist attack. In 2018, “Clade X” simulated a mock pandemic involving a novel virus without a vaccine.
The “Plandemic” video shows footage from Event 201 — with references to travel restrictions and misinformation, for example — next to footage taken during the actual pandemic about those same subjects.
But those specifics aren’t unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Toner, who was the project leader and principal author of Event 201’s storyline.
“Everything we wrote into the storyline are things that have happened over and over again in pandemics and epidemics,” he said.
The 2018 Clade X simulation also involved considerations of travel bans. Toner said such travel limitations are a known government reflex.
The center began preparing for the event about 14 months ahead of time, Toner added, long before the novel coronavirus began spreading in China.
David Martin and Patent Claims
If Event 201 is the backbone of the conspiracy theory in “Plandemic,” then David Martin is the central character. He’s featured throughout the video, making claims primarily about patents.
Martin runs a company called M-CAM, which analyzes patents and intellectual property to estimate the investment value of companies.
M-CAM has five investment companies as clients, managing assets of $1.1 million, according to a recent statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
“Not big in investments, seems more like another guy using predictive modeling as a selling tool for many types of information,” Suzanne Lynch told FactCheck.org in an email, after looking through M-CAM’s SEC filings. Lynch has worked on Wall Street and is now a professor of economic crime at Utica College.
Samuel Rosen, an assistant professor of finance at Temple University’s Fox School of Business, similarly described M-CAM, broadly, as an investment research company and noted in an email to FactCheck.org that it appears Martin manages a small hedge fund, too.
But Martin has also peddled conspiracy theories over the years. He published a novel in 2011, which he claimed was based on real events, alleging a rigged 2008 presidential election that was somehow tied to the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Since the pandemic began, he has used his YouTube channel to promote COVID-19 conspiracy theories. He repeats many of those claims in “Plandemic: Indoctornation.”

In one video from April, Martin referred to Event 201, saying: “COVID-19 is a branded campaign … that is funded by people in the software, data sciences and social media industry. That’s who built COVID-19.” 
The gist of Martin’s video was that wealthy philanthropists like Bill Gates, technology companies, pharmaceutical companies and global health organizations colluded to create a virus that would force governments to fund research and development of vaccines and therapies in order to enrich themselves.
For “Plandemic,” though, Martin shifts his focus away from “the software, data sciences and social media industry.” Instead, he takes aim largely at government entities.
Martin claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saw “the possibility of a gold strike” when the SARS epidemic arose in 2003.
“They saw that a virus they knew could be easily manipulated was something that was very valuable,” he says, pointing to a patent filed by the CDC that year. The patent covered the isolated virus that causes SARS and ways to detect it.
Skimming across the screen while Martin makes that claim is a headline for a November 2003 news story about the race to patent the virus. However, that story doesn’t support his argument. It actually explains that the CDC wasn’t pursuing the patent for profit. Rather, it was doing so to keep others from monopolizing research.

“The whole purpose of the patent is to prevent folks from controlling the technology,” the story quotes CDC spokesman Llelwyn Grant as saying. “This is being done to give the industry and other researchers reasonable access to the samples.”
Similarly, the director of the CDC at the time, Dr. Julie Gerberding, told reporters that filing for the patent was “a protective measure to make sure that the access to the virus remains open for everyone.”
“The concern that the federal government is looking at right now is that we could be locked out of this opportunity to work with this virus if it’s patented by someone else, and so by initiating steps to secure patent rights, we assure that we will be able to continue to make the virus and the products from the virus available in the public domain, and that we can continue to promote the rapid technological transfer of this biomedical information into tools and products that are useful to patients,” Gerberding said in a May 2003 telebriefing.
So, Martin’s claim is at odds with the CDC’s publicly stated motivation, and he offers no evidence to support his argument.
Next, Martin claims that federal law wouldn’t have allowed for a patent on that isolated virus.
Again, he’s wrong.
Instead of reading from U.S. patent law, as he says he is in the video, Martin reads from a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision. That’s an important distinction since the decision, which changed one aspect of patent law that’s relevant here, came 10 years after the CDC filed for a patent related to the virus that causes SARS.
“Nature is prohibited from being patented,” Martin says, claiming that he was quoting from a section of patent law. Building on that, he claims, “either SARS, coronavirus, was manufactured, therefore making a patent on it legal, or it was natural, therefore making a patent on it illegal.”
But that’s a false dichotomy.
While the Supreme Court did find that “[a] naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,” that decision came a decade after the CDC sought the patent.
“Isolated genes (that is, genes extracted from a longer DNA sequence) used to be patentable in the past because the courts decided that just the act of extracting them and removing the non-coding segments caused enough of a modification to turn them into patent-eligible things,” Mario Biagioli, a professor at UCLA School of Law, told FactCheck.org in an email. “No more.  A few years ago the Supreme Court decided that simply isolating a gene did not change it enough. It remained a ‘product of nature’ and therefore unpatentable.”
So, claiming that the patent is either illegal or the virus was “manufactured” is wrong.
After that, Martin takes his claim one step further, saying: “If it was manufactured, it was a violation of biological and chemical weapons treaties and laws. If it was natural, filing a patent on it was illegal. In either outcome, both are illegal.”
That’s not right, either, said Arti Rai, a professor at Duke University School of Law, in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.
In order for scientists to do research on either diseases or biological weapons, they need access to the underlying biological material and there are laws governing who can do that research and in what facilities, said Rai. It’s not necessarily illegal to possess such material.
Also, she noted, something that is illegal to use, like a chemical or biological weapon, isn’t illegal to patent.
“Lots of things have been patented over the years that would be illegal to use,” said Rai. She gave the example of devices for taking illegal drugs, explaining that having a patent on something doesn’t give you the right to use it.
Altogether, the statements Martin makes about legal issues are inaccurate, Rai said, and the way the video presents connections related to those statements are inaccurate, too.
“They try to connect dots in a way that is misleading,” she said.
It’s worth repeating, the 2003 patent filing Martin references involves a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19.
But he isn’t the first to make claims like this. Falsehoods tying unrelated patents to the novel coronavirus have been circulating almost as long as COVID-19 has been around. We wrote about some in January.
Origins of the Virus
After laying the groundwork by suggesting something nefarious was afoot with patents, the video goes on to claim that the novel coronavirus was designed in a lab.
It’s a reprise of one of the claims made by Mikovits in the first video installment, which we addressed then, and other versions of the claim have been circulating since the beginning of the year, which we’ve addressed, too.
While scientists don’t know exactly how the virus transmitted to humans, the consensus is that it was naturally occurring.
“Plandemic,” however, highlights two people who don’t join that consensus. It first shows Dr. Meryl Nass, who is licensed to practice internal medicine in Maine. She campaigned earlier this year against a state law there that required children to be vaccinated. Voters upheld the law in a March referendum. The video then shows Luc Montagnier, who shared a Nobel Prize in 2008 for his contributions in identifying the virus known as HIV in 1983.
Montagnier’s cameo in “Plandemic” is short. Referring to the creation of the novel coronavirus, Willis, the filmmaker, says to him: “You were quoted as saying, ‘it was a meticulous job, done professionally.'”
Montagnier responds: “It could be done by somebody very expert in molecular biology, I think.”
The video then cuts to a clip of Montagnier’s appearance on a French news show. It doesn’t offer evidence to support the claim or give any further explanation of it.
Nass appears for a little longer, but she doesn’t offer any evidence to support her claims, either.
“I feel quite convinced that this is a laboratory-designed organism,” Nass says.
But an article published in Nature Medicine in March found that the novel coronavirus “is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”
The authors said that the virus likely originated in one of two ways: “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” meaning before the spread of disease from animals to humans, or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.”
The virus likely developed in bats before transferring to humans, either directly or through another animal, the World Health Organization explained in March. The CDC has released similar background information.
An accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus can’t be ruled out, according to the Nature Medicine article, but the authors said they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”
Nass twice repeats her criticism that the article doesn’t “hold water,” but she provides no further explanation or evidence to support the claim that the virus was developed in a lab.
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for “more investigation” to determine how the pandemic began. “Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,” they wrote. “Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.”
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story “The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus” for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic. 
COVID-19 Vaccine Compensation
Near the end of “Plandemic,” the filmmakers raise the specter of safety concerns of a COVID-19 vaccine, and make the false claim that it’s “basically impossible” to get compensation if someone is injured from the vaccine.
“Something that people should know about COVID-19 vaccines is they fall today under the PREP Act, which came into being after 9/11 and after an anthrax scare,” says Mary Holland, the vice chair and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, a prominent organization opposed to vaccination, in a talking-head interview in the video. “And this law gives virtually blanket liability protection. It’s basically impossible to get any kind of compensation if you’re injured.”
She continues: “So people need to understand that if you take COVID-19 vaccines, you are absolutely on your own. If you’re permanently injured, if you lose your job, if your health care expenses go through the roof — tough luck.”
Holland is correct that COVID-19 vaccines fall under the PREP Act, or Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005, which provides liability protection for vaccine makers and other companies involved in producing drugs or other products to aid in a pandemic response.
The liability protection is broad, although it does not extend to death or a serious physical injury that results from willful misconduct, as a Health and Human Services Q&A explains.
But Holland is wrong that it’s nearly impossible to get compensation for an injury. In fact, there is an entire system set up to provide compensation for those harmed by vaccines and other products in these scenarios, known as the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, or CICP.
“It is not accurate to say that one cannot get any form of compensation for serious injuries/death resulting from a COVID-19 vaccine, as the CICP is available to provide compensation for countermeasures used in response to public health emergencies and threats, and a covered countermeasure is defined to include vaccines, such as a COVID-19 vaccine,” Eva F. Yin, an associate with the law firm Wilson Sonsini and author of a client advisory about the PREP Act and COVID-19, told us in an email.
According to a Health Resources & Services Administration fact sheet, the program has been in place since 2010, and compensation “may include unreimbursed medical expenses (expenses that health insurance did not cover), lost employment income, and the survivor death benefit.”
A Congressional Research Service report explains that for COVID-19, both the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act appropriate funding that can be used by the compensation program. The report, which mentions the compensation program numerous times, is the same congressional report that the video flashes on screen while Holland makes her false claim.
HRSA spokesman David Bowman told us that people have a year to submit a claim, which is reviewed by medical staff to determine if the individual experienced a covered injury. The decision, he said, is based on “compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence.”
Bowman said the program covers COVID-19 vaccines used in clinical trials. Since its inception in 2010, CICP has paid out a total of $5.7 million for 39 claims.
Most non-pandemic vaccines are covered by a different program, also administered by HRSA, known as the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
Out-of-Context Clip on Vaccine Timeline
Shortly before the compensation claim, the video also features a clip from a “60 Minutes Australia” episode that aired in May and questioned the feasibility and timing of a coronavirus vaccine. 
A voiceover declares a vaccine to be a “great hope,” and asks, “But are we being sold a lie? After all, COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to strike mankind, and we’ve never found a vaccine for any of them.”
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, so it isn’t a coronavirus itself. SARS-CoV-2 is indeed the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans. But four of the human coronaviruses are mild viruses that typically cause cold-like illnesses that are not particularly worth vaccinating against.
The two others are those that cause SARS or MERS. But just because there haven’t been licensed vaccines targeting those viruses doesn’t mean prospects are bad for SARS-CoV-2. 
As Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, explained in a Medscape article, scientists did work on creating a SARS vaccine — but interest and funding fell through once it became clear that the epidemic had been contained. For MERS, the primary hurdle for vaccine development is similar, since outbreaks of the disease are uncommon.
“[G]iven the relatively low incidence even in high-risk groups (camel workers, their families, healthcare workers),” she wrote of a MERS vaccine, “trials could need 100,000-plus participants, which isn’t feasible. As a result, there still isn’t a clear path forward for testing a vaccine and getting it approved by regulators.”
The situation with COVID-19 is quite different. Not only has SARS-CoV-2 not been contained in much of the world, but the world is clamoring for a vaccine. More than 160 vaccines are being pursued, according to the WHO.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has explained before that while there is no guarantee of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, there is no reason to think a vaccine cannot be developed, as the coronavirus elicits an immune response and the results from early-phase clinical trials have been positive.
In the “60 Minutes Australia” segment, New York University School of Medicine bioethicist Arthur Caplan is heard saying, “The shortest time anybody’s ever found a vaccine against any disease that I’m familiar with is about seven years. The average time is 20. To be talking about a magic bullet coming in months, it borders on the absurd.”
Caplan, who supports vaccines and has argued for transparency around a COVID-19 vaccine, told us in a phone interview that his appearance in the “Plandemic” video was not sanctioned.
“I think the video is pure anti-vaccine propaganda. The clip of me is completely out of context. They could have asked me if they wanted my views,” he said. “But they didn’t.”
“What I was trying to get across was that we shouldn’t plan on having a vaccine soon, despite some rosy pronouncements from the president and some others,” he said. “And that we better be prepared to continue our social distancing, masking, testing, hand hygiene [and] improving ventilation well into next year.”
A vaccine, Caplan added, “would be a real tool, but it’s not going to replace or eliminate the need for behavioral modifications in dealing with the virus.”
The fastest time for vaccine development is actually four years, not seven, Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia told us in an email. Vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman isolated the mumps virus from his daughter in 1963, which led to the licensed Mumpsvax vaccine in 1967. It is still used today as part of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine. 
According to the CDC’s Pink Book, a textbook covering the epidemiology and prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases, there was an earlier mumps vaccine that took just three years to develop, but it wasn’t as effective and was discontinued in the mid-1970s.
Caplan said when he estimated seven years, he was sharing what he was aware of at the time.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2020-08-21 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“And that we better be prepared to continue our social distancing, masking, testing, hand hygiene [and  improving ventilation well into next year.”

3,Trump’s False Claim on Tijuana Coronavirus Cases,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/trumps-false-claim-on-tijuana-coronavirus-cases/,,"President Donald Trump falsely claimed, “Tijuana is the most heavily infected place anywhere in the world, as far as the plague is concerned,” referring to the novel coronavirus.
Trump made the inaccurate statement in remarks June 5 at a roundtable on supporting America’s fishermen in Bangor, Maine.
You don’t have to look very far from the Mexican city to find a place with a much higher infection rate: the city of San Diego, California, right across the border.
Tijuana has had 2,335 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the latest statistics from the Baja California secretary of health. Mexico estimates Tijuana’s 2020 population at 1,789,531 – which would result in an infection rate of 130.5 per 100,000 people. It currently has just 69 active cases.
San Diego has had 3,880 COVID-19 cases and a rate of 273.3 cases per 100,000 through June 8, according to the county website. That’s twice as high as Tijuana’s rate.
At the same time, though, COVID-19 has been much deadlier in Tijuana. The city has experienced 643 deaths, while all of San Diego County, which includes the city, has had 301.
San Diego is hardly the only place with more infection than Tijuana.
For example, the District of Columbia, home of the White House and the Trump International Hotel, has about half of Tijuana’s population. Yet, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center, the nation’s capital, as of June 10, has had 9,474 cases of COVID-19, or 1,348.7 cases per 100,000 residents — a rate that is about 10 times higher than the Mexican city.

And the numbers are far more dramatic in such big-city disease hotspots as Cook County, Illinois, Chicago’s county, whose population of about 5.15 million has suffered 83,271 cases, and Los Angeles County, population about 10 million, with 65,945 cases. 
Queens County, New York, where Trump grew up, has had 62,466 cases for a rate of 2,741 cases per 100,000 — 21 times Tijuana’s rate, according to Johns Hopkins. 
And Palm Beach, Florida, home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, also has a far higher per capita rate than Tijuana. As of June 10, it has had 7,518 cases or 505.9 cases per 100,000 – nearly four times Tijuana’s rate.
Baja California Gov. Jaime Bonilla fired back at Trump’s off-base shot at Tijuana. “Mr. Trump sees the straw in someone else’s eye but does not see the beam in his own — instead of looking at the other side of the fence to see what is wrong, first take a look within your own house,” Bonilla said.
But Tijuana Mayor Arturo González said he felt Trump’s pain.
“The statements made by @realDonaldTrump are understandable, I don’t judge it,” the mayor tweeted. “In the country with the most Covid 19 deaths in the world, protests in more than 50 cities and elections on the doorstep, it is understandable that he has to distract attention from something or someone and it was our turn #Tijuana.”
Trump has mentioned Tijuana and the coronavirus before in connection with his campaign to build a wall to improve security along the Mexican border.
Trump, May 5: And in Tijuana, right along the border, they have a tremendous outbreak. And we have just completed 172 miles of wall. And it’s real wall, not the kind you were having built over the years that were sort of scoffed at, right?
He sounded a similar note three weeks later.
Trump, May 28: Mexico is having a very, very hard time, as you know, with COVID, especially along the border … with Tijuana and various places along the border. And fortunately, we have brand-new wall along there, and the wall is saving us.
While Trump was wrong about Tijuana’s numbers, there is no doubt Mexico, as so much of the world, has been hit hard by COVID-19. But not as badly as the United States.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University as of June 10, Mexico has 124,301 cases and 14,649 deaths. There have been 1,973,230 cases and 111,694 deaths in the U.S. The U.S. has a death rate (34.14 deaths per 100,000 people) that is nearly three times Mexico’s (11.61 deaths per 100,000).",Rem Rieder,2020-06-10 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"And the numbers are far more dramatic in such big-city disease hotspots as Cook County, Illinois, Chicago’s county, whose population of about 5.15 million has suffered 83,271 cases, and Los Angeles County, population about 10 million, with 65,945 cases. Yet, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center, the nation’s capital, as of June 10, has had 9,474 cases of COVID-19, or 1,348.7 cases per 100,000 residents — a rate that is about 10 times higher than the Mexican city.

4,Social Media Post on Use of Ivermectin for Refugees Lacks Context,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/scicheck-facebook-post-on-use-of-ivermectin-for-refugees-lacks-context/,,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of ivermectin as a treatment for arriving refugees to treat parasitic infections. But a social media post by Dr. Simone Gold, a proponent of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19, references the CDC guidance without accurately explaining the reason why refugees are given the drug. The CDC has warned against using ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19.
What treatments are available for COVID-19? There are no cures for COVID-19. So far, only a few evidence-based treatments are available.
One is the antiviral drug remdesivir, which received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in October for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. The FDA based its approval on randomized, controlled clinical trials that found faster recovery times and statistically significant odds of improving conditions among patients with mild to severe COVID-19 who received the drug, compared with those who got a placebo plus standard care.
That’s the only FDA-approved treatment, but the agency has granted emergency use authorization to others. For instance, based on the findings of randomized controlled trials, it has authorized the use of several monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 for patients with mild to moderate disease who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19. These drugs are synthetic antibodies that are designed to prevent the virus from entering cells, although some may not be effective against all variants of the coronavirus.
Another key drug in the limited arsenal is the steroid dexamethasone, which was found in a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K. to provide a mortality benefit in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were ventilated or receiving supplemental oxygen. The finding was announced in June 2020. Dexamethasone, however, did not help patients who weren’t receiving respiratory support, and may have harmed them.
A large randomized controlled trial conducted in Brazil and published in the Lancet Global Health in late October also found fluvoxamine, a cheap antidepressant and obsessive-compulsive disorder drug, reduced the risk of hospitalization and prolonged ER visits by 32% when given early to high-risk outpatients. When the analysis was limited to the people who actually took fluvoxamine regularly, the results were even more impressive, showing a 66% drop in hospitalization or a prolonged ER stay and a 91% reduction in death.
The FDA has also issued EUAs for two immune modulating drugs, tocilizumab and baricitinib, for use in certain patients who are hospitalized, in combination with other drugs. Both drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and are thought to help by tamping down an overactive immune system later in the disease progression.
Baricitinib was authorized in combination with remdesivir for hospitalized patients who require ventilation or supplemental oxygen; that decision was based on a randomized, controlled clinical trial that found faster recovery times and better odds of improvement with the drug combination. Tocilizumab was authorized for patients taking systemic corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, who need supplemental oxygen or ventilation.
Convalescent plasma, or the part of the blood that contains antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19, has also been studied as a potential treatment. In February 2021, the FDA modified its EUA to include only plasma with a high concentration of antibodies “for the treatment of hospitalized patients early in the disease course,” following studies that found no benefit with lower antibody amounts. In a March 9 letter, the FDA noted that “the clinical evidence supporting this EUA remains limited” and encouraged health care providers to enroll patients in ongoing clinical trials. The NIH’s COVID-19 treatment guidelines do not currently recommend convalescent plasma for any patient group.              Link to this

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic medication for humans and animals, has been a source of controversy in recent months as unfounded claims that the drug is an effective treatment for COVID-19 have gained traction online. 
Despite the increasing circulation of these claims, ivermectin is not an authorized treatment for COVID-19. Studies of the drug’s efficacy and safety are ongoing. But, as of now, its use in treating COVID-19 outside of clinical trials is not recommended by the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. (For more, see SciCheck’s “Ongoing Clinical Trials Will Decide Whether (or Not) Ivermectin Is Safe, Effective for COVID-19.”)
A recent Facebook post highlighted a tweet by Dr. Simone Gold, who has advocated the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, saying that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “officially recommends administering ivermectin as presumptive therapy (giving medication without a diagnosis) to refugees.”
Gold continues: “The FDA approved it for human use in February 1996. The media’s claim that ivermectin is only a de-wormer for animals is a flat-out lie.”
But by failing to indicate why ivermectin is a recommended treatment for refugees, Gold may leave the false impression that the drug is being used to treat COVID-19. 
In fact, some of the comments on the post indicate that readers did get that false impression. For instance, one person commented: “Why does the CDC care more about refugees than the American people?”

The CDC actually recommends ivermectin as a presumptive treatment for incoming refugees to fight parasitic infections, not COVID-19. The use of ivermectin is aimed at treating a disease called strongyloidiasis, caused by a common parasite, a roundworm, in refugees from Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and parts of Africa. 
Ivermectin is approved for human use to treat some conditions caused by parasites, such as strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, which is otherwise known as “river blindness.”
Ivermectin is not recommended by the CDC as a treatment for COVID-19. In fact, the CDC issued a health advisory on Aug. 26 warning against misusing ivermectin to either prevent or treat COVID-19.
“Adverse effects associated with ivermectin misuse and overdose are increasing, as shown by a rise in calls to poison control centers reporting overdoses and more people experiencing adverse effects,” the CDC advisory said.
Gold, who founded the organization America’s Frontline Doctors, has previously made misleading claims about COVID-19 treatments. As we’ve reported, Gold has touted hydroxychloroquine as a “cure” for COVID-19 despite the fact that randomized controlled trials have found the drug isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized patients. 
America’s Frontline Doctors has a page dedicated to promoting unapproved and unproven treatment options for COVID-19. (The antiviral drug remdesivir is the only treatment for COVID-19 approved by the FDA, although the agency has granted emergency use authorization to others.)

5,Cuomo Distorts CDC Finding in Blaming Trump,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/cuomo-distorts-cdc-finding-in-blaming-trump/,,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made the over-the-top claim that if the Trump administration “had done its job, the virus wouldn’t come” to New York. Cuomo pointed to a study that suggested government officials could have better mitigated the spread of the coronavirus in New York City, but it didn’t say they could have stopped it.
Cuomo made his comments in a July 16 CNN interview after anchor Kate Bolduan asked him about criticism from CNN’s Jake Tapper of a poster Cuomo released depicting New York’s fight against the coronavirus as a successful climb up and down a mountain. The poster, which Cuomo sketched and can be purchased for $11.50, is a whimsical homage of sorts to early 1900s poster art.
Tapper, in a July 14 Twitter thread, mentioned the poster in criticizing the “crowing” from Cuomo’s administration over the state’s handling of the pandemic. “NY state has lost more than 32,000 lives to COVID-19,” Tapper wrote. “So while it’s great that the numbers have gone down, it’s perplexing to see crowing. … No other state has lost as many lives, not even close.”
The poster doesn’t mention that. Bolduan asked Cuomo: “Do you think the poster was a mistake in the midst of all this?”
The governor responded by referring to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that he and Bolduan had discussed. The study found that genome sequencing of positive coronavirus cases in New York City mostly resembled sequences in Europe, but the U.S. government’s travel restrictions on Europe were implemented too late to mitigate the introduction of the virus. Those restrictions were implemented on March 13; by March 15, the CDC report says, “community transmission was widespread in New York City.”
Cuomo, July 16: No, Tapper’s point — as you just heard from the CDC report, Tapper should say that Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York, because that’s the fact. That’s what the CDC just said.
If Trump’s government had done its job, the virus wouldn’t come here. We don’t do — governors don’t do global pandemics. I was trying to explain that to Mr. Tapper. State governments don’t do global public health. …
The federal government does that. The virus didn’t come here because of anything New Yorkers did. The virus came here because the federal government missed it. That’s what the CDC, the federal government, says today.
The governor got it right when he said earlier in the interview that the CDC “says the virus came from Europe and the travel ban was too late.” That’s the main takeaway from the report. But the CDC didn’t say that “Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York” or that the federal government could have stopped the virus from coming to New York, as Cuomo suggests.
As we’ve written before — in looking at Trump’s unsupported claims that his restrictions on travel from China have saved “hundreds of thousands” of lives — the research on international travel limitations shows they can delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
We asked the governor’s press office for clarification on his remarks and what he believed the Trump administration could have done to stop the virus from coming to New York. We haven’t received a response.
What the CDC Said
The CDC report, released on July 16, used specimens collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene from March 1 through 20 at six hospital emergency rooms from patients with influenza-like symptoms who had tested negative for influenza. Of the 544 specimens, the CDC found 36 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC then used genetic sequencing and found the positive specimens in New York City mostly resembled the genetic sequences of the virus circulating in Europe.
“Using genetic sequencing, CDC determined that the sequences of most SARS-CoV-2–positive specimens resembled those circulating in Europe, suggesting probable introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from Europe, from other U.S. locations, and local introductions from within New York,” the report said. “These findings demonstrate that partnering with health care facilities and developing the systems needed for rapid implementation of sentinel surveillance, coupled with capacity for genetic sequencing before an outbreak, can help inform timely containment and mitigation strategies.”
The study also found that the earliest specimens, from March 2, weren’t connected to genome sequences from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019. This was “unanticipated,” the report said, because most of the emergency departments that collected the specimens were in ZIP codes with a high percentage of Chinese speakers.
The study suggests the virus spreading in New York City in March largely wasn’t affected by the federal government’s restrictions on travel to and from China, which were implemented on Feb. 2. Those restrictions said that non-U.S. citizens were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, but there were exceptions for citizens, permanent residents and the immediate family members of both.
While such travel policies “are an important mitigation strategy,” the CDC said, the subsequent restrictions on travel from Europe — imposed on March 13, with the same exceptions — came too late. “[B]y the time the European restrictions were implemented, importation and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 had already occurred in NYC.”
Five days earlier, on March 8, the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had announced sustained community transmission of the virus. That week, there were 1,917 confirmed cases in the city, and the CDC’s report estimated there were another 1,170 undetected cases.
And by March 15, just two days after the travel restrictions on Europe went into effect, “community transmission was widespread in New York City,” the report said.
Limited testing availability and strict criteria harmed the ability to detect cases and slow the spread, the report further said.
“Expanding the testing criteria at the beginning of the outbreak to include persons with any travel exposure and with [influenza-like symptoms] without an alternative diagnosis would have increased the number of cases detected through passive surveillance,” the CDC said. “Limited testing capability and strict testing criteria led to many COVID-19 cases going undetected, slowed DOHMH’s capacity to use surveillance to make timely public health decisions, and ultimately contributed to sustained community transmission.”
The report does have at least six limitations, it said — most notably, the small number of patients, which “led to large uncertainty in estimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the number of undetected COVID-19 cases in the target population.”
But the findings show the travel policies don’t appear to have made much of an impact — if any — on the virus’ arrival in New York City. And testing limitations further contributed to the spread of the virus. The CDC, however, doesn’t say, as Cuomo claimed, that “Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York,” or that a different strategy could have stopped the virus from coming.
The Impact of Travel Restrictions
“While it is true that banning travelers from China did not keep the virus out of the US, it is unrealistic to think that it would have been possible to implement expanded travel bans to try and stop the virus,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us in an email. “It is very difficult to know in real time where in the world the virus is and this makes it near impossible to create a list of countries from which to ban travel. So far, all evidence suggests that no country has been successful in using travel bans to prevent the virus from entering its borders.”
Similarly, we found previously that studies of this pandemic as well as past research have shown travel restrictions can slow a virus’ spread but not stop it.
Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us in April when we looked into this issue that previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the policies have to be very strict to have an effect. Travel restrictions “can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,” Omer said. But, “even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.”
The U.S. travel restrictions were limited, of course, and so was testing for the virus generally.
Initially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a severe acute lower respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed. 
Nuzzo told us previously that in February, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren’t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. “would likely not have picked it up” if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus “because we weren’t using these other countries as criteria for testing,” she said.
And the U.S. wasn’t using travel from European countries as criteria for testing, either. But it’s worth noting, there weren’t many confirmed cases in Europe in late February.
A report by European researchers said that on Feb. 21 there were just 47 confirmed cases in nine European countries (not including another nine cases in the United Kingdom). Nearly two weeks later, on March 5, the number had grown significantly, to 4,250 cases, and 113 deaths, among 38 countries in the World Health Organization’s European region.
The CDC’s July report indicates that expanded testing — “to include persons with any travel exposure” and flu-like symptoms — could have aided public health officials in their decision-making and potentially reduced the community transmission.
We asked Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse whether the Trump administration could have done anything to stop the virus from coming to New York. He agreed that it’s unlikely any policy could have stopped the introduction of the virus entirely.
“I’m not surprised that New York, a crossroads of the world, would be at high risk, and we don’t know which of the several introductions took root and which fizzled out,” Morse said in an email. “With the type of genomic work described in the paper, it becomes more possible to make these distinctions now. Since we’re not yet very good at foretelling the future, I think the data are very informative to us scientists, but the main goal should still be to stop spread and establishment of an infection as soon as we possibly can. Period.”
Morse said Cuomo and New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard A. Zucker “deserve the great credit they’ve gotten for taking this seriously and usually acting accordingly, and communicating appropriately.” But he also said he has been “stunned and disheartened by the total lack of seriousness and urgency with which most western countries have treated this outbreak.”
“There were numerous missed opportunities for the pandemic to be slowed or possibly even stopped,” he said. Travel restrictions targeting Wuhan “might have had some value if carried out well” and “[v]ery early on.” But once people infected with the virus had traveled to other places around the world, “such focused measures were no longer feasible.”
A testing and tracing policy is “more effective the earlier you can do it,” he said. “With more infections, and additional dispersion, the complexity of the work increases astronomically, and it’s not really sustainable. … I would suggest, based on the current situation, we wouldn’t be any better off now if the virus (even with all we know about it and all our tools) arrived today, instead of early 2020, and doubt we’d be any more effective at stopping it.”
All that said, it’s clear from the CDC report that the U.S. travel restrictions did little to mitigate infections traced to Europe from spreading in New York City, and the report notes that limitations in testing ability “contributed to sustained community transmission.” But Cuomo goes too far in claiming that the CDC said “Trump is to blame for the virus coming to New York.” The report did not say the virus could have been stopped from coming to New York entirely.",Lori Robertson,2020-07-24 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“Limited testing capability and strict testing criteria led to many COVID-19 cases going undetected, slowed DOHMH’s capacity to use surveillance to make timely public health decisions, and ultimately contributed to sustained community transmission.”

6,Viral Claim Gets Biden’s COVID-19 Travel and Immigration Policies Wrong,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-viral-claim-gets-bidens-covid-19-travel-and-immigration-policies-wrong/,,"SciCheck Digest
The Biden administration hasn’t introduced COVID-19 travel restrictions on Americans going to Mexico since the delta variant became dominant in the U.S., and it is enforcing immigration laws at the border. But a meme falsely claiming the opposite is circulating online.


Full Story
Two topics that routinely draw false claims on social media are COVID-19 and immigration at the U.S. border with Mexico.
A claim currently circulating online misrepresents the Biden administration’s actions on both issues.
A Twitter account with “trump won” in its bio posted this false claim, which has been retweeted more than 2,700 times and shared on Facebook: “The COVID delta variant is so deadly Biden is restricting travel for Americans into Mexico but is keeping the border wide open for illegal aliens to walk right into our country.”
Neither of its major points is correct. Biden hasn’t initiated any travel restrictions for Americans going to Mexico since the delta variant became dominant in the U.S. in July, and his administration is enforcing existing immigration laws.
As for the travel portion of the claim, the administration has recently extended restrictions on non-essential travel from Mexico into the United States at land ports of entry due to COVID-19 through Aug. 21. But the travel limits have been in effect since March 21, 2020, and they do not prevent U.S. citizens and permanent lawful residents from traveling to Mexico or returning to the United States. Also, the restrictions apply only to land and ferry border crossing, not air travel.
Although there is no restriction on Americans flying to Mexico, those who do fly there will have to provide negative COVID-19 test results before their return flight. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that pandemic-related order on Jan. 12 under the previous administration, and it went into effect on Jan. 26 under Biden — so it’s not new, either.
The State Department also urges travelers to reconsider going to Mexico since the CDC has listed the country’s COVID-19 risk level as “high.” That’s the third level in the CDC’s four-tiered system.
The part of the claim asserting that the border is “wide open for illegal aliens” is also wrong. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has made hundreds of thousands of apprehensions and expulsions at the southwest border since Biden took office.
More than 500,000 expulsions were made from February to June under Title 42, a public health law the Trump administration began using in March 2020 to expel people at the border in the name of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
During the Trump administration, from March 2020 to January 2021 there were more than 459,000 expulsions.
Many Democrats and immigrant advocates have urged Biden to rescind the policy, but it remains in effect.
So, the claim is wrong about both travel restrictions and border policy.
Update, Aug. 3: On Aug. 2, the CDC extended the use of the public health order under Title 42 that allows the CBP to immediately expel those trying to cross the border illegally. The CDC said it will reassess the need for the order every 60 days and confirmed that the exception for children, which it announced on July 16, remains in effect.

7,FactChecking Biden’s Inaugural Address,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/01/factchecking-bidens-inaugural-address/,,"Returning to a time when inaugural addresses promised unity and hope, but few facts, the newly sworn-in President Joe Biden delivered a traditional speech at his inauguration that offered little for fact-checkers.
When he did offer us some facts to check, the 46th president of the United States largely hit his marks on domestic threats, COVID-19 and the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913 in a 21-minute speech.
Domestic Threats
Biden, Jan. 20: And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.
Biden is correct about the rise in “political extremism.” Even before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the Department of Homeland Security warned in its Homeland Threat Assessment report, which was issued in October, about “an elevated threat environment” from political extremists.
“Some U.S.-based violent extremists have capitalized on increased social and political tensions in 2020, which will drive an elevated threat environment at least through early 2021,” the report said. “Violent extremists will continue to target individuals or institutions that represent symbols of their grievances, as well as grievances based on political affiliation or perceived policy positions.”
As for white supremacy, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a February 2019 report that white nationalist groups increased by nearly 50% in a single year, “growing from 100 chapters in 2017 to 148 in 2018.”
The FBI, which releases annual data on hate crimes, reported 7,314 hate crime incidents involving 8,559 offenses in 2019 — up from 6,121 criminal incidents and 7,321 related offenses in 2016, when Biden was vice president. That’s an increase of 19.5% in hate crimes. In 2016, 46.3% of the known offenders were white, rising to 52.5% in 2019.
At a Sept. 17 hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that “racially motivated violent extremism” is the largest share of domestic terrorism, and within that category those engaged in “some kind of white supremacist-type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that.”
The United States is not alone in grappling with white supremacy, which is spreading globally.
In a 2019 terrorism report, which was issued in June, the State Department said racially or ethnically motivated terrorism, or REMT, “in particular white supremacist terrorism, continues to be a threat to the global community, with violence both on the rise and spreading geographically, as white supremacist and nativist movements and individuals increasingly target immigrants; Jewish, Muslim, and other religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or intersex (LGBTI) individuals; governments; and other perceived enemies.”
COVID-19 Deaths
Biden, Jan. 20: It’s [COVID-19] taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.
We’re quibbling, but Biden would have been on firmer ground had he said there have been more COVID-19 deaths than “battle deaths” from WWII.
According to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, updated at 12:21 p.m. on Jan. 20, around the time Biden made his remarks, the U.S. had 402,997 deaths from COVID-19 so far (there is some lag in reporting). According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, there were 291,557 battle deaths in World War II. There were another 113,842 deaths among service members not in theater. That comes to 405,399 total U.S. deaths in World War II. 
Sadly, given the average number of deaths from COVID-19 in recent days, Biden’s statement will likely be true by the end of the day.
Business Closures
Biden, Jan. 20: Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.
As we’ve written, Biden does inherit an economy that has 9.8 million fewer jobs since the pre-pandemic recession peak in February. But the total number of businesses that have permanently closed due to the pandemic — as Biden’s remarks suggest — is currently unknown.
In September, Yelp, an advertising website and mobile app for local businesses, reported that a total of 163,735 businesses using its platform had closed during the pandemic, between March 1 and Aug. 31. About 60% of that total, or 97,966 closures, are believed to be permanent.
Yelp says its “closure counts are likely an estimate of the businesses most impacted, with many others not counted because they remain open with curtailed hours and staffing, or because they have not yet updated their Yelp business pages to reflect closures.” So the data could be an underestimate of the number of short- or long-term business closures.
That same month, economics professor Steven Hamilton — using earlier figures from Yelp and Womply, a data and software company for local businesses — estimated that 420,000 small businesses in the U.S. had closed permanently by July 10.
But at this point, an estimate is all it is. An official count is unavailable.
Women’s March
Biden, Jan. 20: Here we stand where 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman in American history, elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me things can’t change.
Biden was referring to the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913. On March 3, 1913, the day before President-elect Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration, more than 5,000 marchers paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue in support of women’s right to vote.
According to a Library of Congress essay on the event, “the crowds, mostly men in town for the following day’s inauguration of Woodrow Wilson, surged into the street making it almost impossible for the marchers to pass.” According to testimony later provided in a Senate hearing, “Women were jeered, tripped, grabbed, shoved, and many heard ‘indecent epithets’ and ‘barnyard conversation.’”
In all, 100 marchers were injured and taken to the hospital, and a troop of cavalry from Virginia was called in to control the crowd, according to the Library of Congress essay. Still, the essay notes, many of those in the parade completed the route, and the event provided the suffrage movement “an infusion of vigor.”
The 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote, was ratified seven years later on Aug. 18, 1920. Since 1964, more women have voted in presidential elections than men.

8,April Fool’s Posts Falsely Claim Students Must Repeat the School Year,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/april-fools-posts-falsely-claim-students-must-repeat-the-school-year/,,"The combined forces of the COVID-19 pandemic and the internet have made this April Fool’s Day a treacherous one. Jokes that may have once been good for a laugh among friends now have the potential to mislead social media users at a time when dangerous misinformation on health and public policy is proliferating.
One prank-generating website has been used to make dozens of false headlines, including many versions of a claim that students will have to repeat the school year:

“All Virginia students will repeat current grade next year”
“California: Students will repeat their grade for the 2021 school year”
“Governor announces all children in TN will repeat same grade next year”
“All Pennsylvania kids to repeat their current grade next year”
“NJ to repeat current grade next year”
“All Illinois Students to Repeat Current Grade Next Year”

All of these posts, which were shared on Facebook, link back to the prank-generating website that shows this message: “April Fools!” But if users don’t click through, all they see is what looks like a regular news headline paired with a picture of a public official. In the case of the headlines above, most featured a picture of the governor of the state that was named.
While many schools have closed in an effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, we haven’t found any indication that students will have to repeat a grade. All of the states mentioned above — Virginia, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Illinois — have closed schools. Some have suspended testing requirements. But none have recommended repeating the school year.
The same prank site has created a spate of other bogus headlines, including some that fuel rumors we’ve already debunked.
So, be wary of alarming headlines shared on social media. Like the fake posts about the school year, they may not be true.

9,Paul Misleads on Natural Infection and COVID-19 Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/paul-misleads-on-natural-infection-and-covid-19-vaccines/,,"In a tweet, Sen. Rand Paul misleadingly suggested that immunity from “[n]aturally acquired” COVID-19 was better than that from a vaccine. But it’s not known how immunity from the two sources compares — and the entire point of a vaccine is to offer immunity without the risk of getting sick.
Paul made his claim in a Nov. 17 tweet in which he listed interim efficacy figures from two ongoing vaccine clinical trials and then provided his own calculation of the “effectiveness” of natural infection with the coronavirus.

Great news! 
– Pfizer vaccine 90% effective
– Moderna vaccine 94.5% effective – Naturally acquired COVID-19  99.9982% percent effective*
 * (estimating 200 reinfections out of 11 million Americans, which is likely an overestimation of actual reinfections)
— Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 17, 2020

In a follow-up tweet, the Kentucky Republican shared a link to a New York Times article about a new unpublished study that found evidence of some immunity to the coronavirus in most people for at least six months. He commented: “Why does the left accept immune theory when it comes to vaccines, but not when discussing naturally acquired immunity?”
Paul, who has previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccines, has inaccurately argued during the COVID-19 pandemic that parts of the U.S. have reached herd, or community, immunity because of preexisting immunity to other coronaviruses. Herd immunity is when enough people in a population are immune to prevent spread of the disease.

Public health experts, however, have said that threshold is still a ways off — and that allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled would lead to many needless deaths. A better approach, they say, is to stave off the spread of the virus until a vaccine is widely available.
A Paul spokesperson told us that the senator was not suggesting that immunity through natural infection with COVID-19 is better than getting immunity from a vaccine, but rather, “highlighting research that says immunity is real.”
We were directed to subsequent tweets, including one in which Paul said he was not “arguing against vaccines” but that COVID-19 patients “can celebrate immunity if lucky enough to survive,” as well as Paul’s support for alternative options to speed along access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Still, the efficacy figure Paul provides for natural COVID-19 infection isn’t accurate. And the juxtaposition of the numbers implies a kind of superiority of natural infection over vaccination — a dangerous notion, given that contracting the virus poses a serious risk.
As University of Florida biostatistician Natalie Dean pointed out in response to Paul’s tweet, “The key distinction is that vaccines are a SAFE way to achieve immunity. Getting sick with COVID-19 is inherently unsafe. We would never ever tolerate a vaccine that carried even a fraction of the risks of natural infection.”
Bogus ‘Efficacy’ Figure
While Paul purports to offer a precise percentage for how “effective” natural infection is relative to vaccines, experts told us that the comparison is premature and faulty. 
The efficacy figures for the vaccines come from interim results released in press releases by the two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, and refer to the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 infection in phase 3 trials. (The day after Paul’s tweet, Pfizer announced additional data reflective of the full trial, which showed 95% efficacy.) But the number for natural infection is a broad-strokes calculation Paul made based on reinfections.
“We don’t really know how many reinfections there have been,” virologist Angela Rasmussen said in a phone interview, adding that many reinfections have not been confirmed and that efficacy of naturally-acquired immunity “isn’t a thing.”
“It’s just really ridiculous to try to use the way that efficacy is calculated in clinical trials for vaccines and apply that to epi[demiologic] data across the entire population,” she said.
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, agreed.
“Clearly, there are people who can be reinfected. As a general rule, it’s usually more mild reinfection,” he told us. But, he added, “most people aren’t tested, so you don’t really know who’s getting reinfected and who isn’t.”
It’s true that reinfections so far appear to be rare, which bodes well both for a vaccine and for people who may have immunity as a result of infection. But no one knows yet how the immunity from each will compare.
Most vaccines do not offer quite as good protection from a pathogen as a natural infection will — but of course, a person has to survive or suffer through the infection to get that future protection, sidestepping the entire function of a vaccine. It’s therefore largely irrelevant whether or not vaccine immunity is superior to that from natural infection.
There are some instances in which a vaccine does elicit a better immune response. That’s the case for vaccines against human papillomavirus, or HPV; tetanus; Haemophilus influenzae type b; and pneumococcus.
Whether COVID-19 will be one of them remains to be seen. Rasmussen said it was possible, but still hypothetical at this point. “We don’t really know. We only know that these vaccines typically induce levels of neutralizing antibody that are comparable to the higher levels of neutralizing antibody that’s been observed in convalescent patients,” she said, referring to the type of antibody that can prevent cells from becoming infected with the virus.
Based on the performance of the shingles vaccine, Offit speculated that some of the later-arriving vaccine candidates that include powerful adjuvants, or chemicals that are added to vaccines to boost the immune response, such as those from Sanofi-GSK or Novavax, might be better than natural infection.
Immunity Unknowns
For both the vaccine and natural infection, important questions about COVID-19 immunity remain.
“We do know that most people who get COVID-19 do develop some kind of measurable antibody response, but we don’t know what that really means in terms of protection against either reinfection or whether you will mount protective immune responses upon a re-exposure,” said Rasmussen.
As a result, public health officials have cautioned that for now, even if people have previously contracted COVID-19, individuals should still follow the standard recommendations. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, advises all people, including those who have recovered from COVID-19, to continue to physically distance, wear masks, wash their hands and avoid crowds.
Similarly, the CDC notes that it doesn’t yet know “if or when” it will stop recommending masks or physical distancing after vaccination.
This is in contrast to Paul’s assertion that people “can celebrate immunity.” In a Nov. 12 interview on Fox News, Paul used similar language and advocated that people drop these precautions. 
“We have 11 million people in our country who’ve already had COVID. We should tell them to celebrate,” he said. “We should tell them to throw away their masks, go to restaurants, live again, because these people are now immune.”
A huge question is how durable immunity will be. Although the study Paul highlighted suggests that most people will be protected for at least six months — and might mean they are protected against severe disease for many years — it’s still not definitive, and doesn’t mean that those timeframes will apply to everyone.
Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and one of the senior authors of the paper, noted on Twitter that the team observed a wide range of immune responses in people, including a lack of a measurable response in some people. 
“That led us to speculate,” he said, quoting his manuscript, that “‘it may be expected that at least a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2-infected population with particularly low immune memory would be susceptible to re-infection relatively quickly.’”
The CDC, notably, has said that people who have had COVID-19 may still benefit from a coronavirus vaccine. And some experts envision a future in which multiple vaccines are on the table for everyone. 
“It strikes me as not unlikely that we will learn what the duration of protection is and people will need — whether naturally infected or vaccinated — to have booster shots over some period of time, once a year, once every two years, once every five years,” Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a press call.
Why Naturally-Acquired Herd Immunity Is a Bad Idea
In his tweet about the new immunity study, Paul also suggested that Democrats were somehow denying realities about immunity from natural infection.
“Why does the left accept immune theory when it comes to vaccines, but not when discussing naturally acquired immunity?” he asked.
Scientists, however, objected to Paul’s characterization.
“I don’t think anybody’s dismissing [immunity following natural infection]. I think what people are saying is, it’s a bad idea as a strategy for dealing with infection,” said Offit, who noted that 30% to 40% of the population could be considered at high risk for COVID-19.
Both Offit and Rasmussen also pointed out that historically, there isn’t a lot of precedent for building herd immunity through natural infection.
“People were getting smallpox for millennia,” Rasmussen said, and “the herd immunity threshold was never really reached.”
The much safer way of getting to herd immunity is to use a vaccine instead, especially when multiple candidates are on the horizon.
“Trying to achieve herd immunity [without a vaccine] would result in hundreds of thousands more — if not millions — of unnecessary deaths and debilitating illness for millions more,” Rasmussen said. “So I think it’s not really right to talk about vaccine-induced herd immunity versus naturally-acquired herd immunity without mentioning the fact that one of them has a very, very large price tag in human lives and quality of life attached to it.”",Jessica McDonald,2020-11-19 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"A Paul spokesperson told us that the senator was not suggesting that immunity through natural infection with COVID-19 is better than getting immunity from a vaccine, but rather, “highlighting research that says immunity is real.”

10,False Claim of Deadly Coronavirus Vaccine Trial in Africa,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/false-claim-of-deadly-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-in-africa/,,"Full Story 
There is no vaccine developed yet for the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, though some clinical tests for potential vaccines are underway in the U.S. and China.
But a falsehood circulating across social media platforms — spread through numerous posts, headlines and screenshots — is wrongly purporting that seven children in Senegal died after being given an experimental vaccine for the virus.
“Mass vaccination for COVID-19 in Senegal was started yesterday (4/8) and the first 7 CHILDREN who received it DIED on the spot,” a Facebook post reads. An Instagram post from an account called “bye_bye_big_pharma” says that “CV vaccine tested in patients in Africa started yesterday. (4/8/2020) It was passed without any animal safety studies. 7 children died on the spot after injection.”
That’s not true.

There is no clinical trial currently underway in that country, or anywhere in Africa, according to a list of vaccine candidates compiled for the scientific journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. As of April 8, there were 115 candidates worldwide — and while 78 were confirmed as active, only five are in the clinical trial phase. Those five trials are happening in the U.S. and China.
The false claim appears to stem from a viral video that shows a crowd of people in a street near a police car. A French speaker in the video tells of a “serious scandal in Senegal.” Sharon Bell, an assistant professor of French translation at Kent State University, translated the video for FactCheck.org.
The speaker claims that “a guy … went into a house to vaccinate children against the problem of Coronavirus, the COVID-19. He vaccinated seven people, children. Seven children. They immediately died. They dropped dead.” It further says the police are on the scene.
But the speaker’s claims evidently were added to the original video, which told a very different story.
AFP Senegal found the video in a late March news report in that country — and it didn’t say that anybody had died. Instead, the video appeared in a story about the alleged arrest of two individuals claiming they had vaccines.
That video — which is in Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal — does not claim that any children died, according to Omar Ka, an associate professor of modern languages, linguistics and intercultural communication at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
“The difference between the French version and the Wolof one is that the latter does not talk about children being killed,” Ka told us in an email. “It simply states that an individual was caught trying to vaccinate people for COVID-19 and he was chased away, finding refuge at the neighborhood leader’s (Chef de Quartier, in French) house.”
Ka said that in the beginning of the French version, “you can clearly overhear the Wolof narrator, but he gets quickly overtaken by the French-speaking narrator.” The French version, he said, “definitely is not a translation of the Wolof version” — he said it adds more dramatic details, “talking about seven kids killed and the need in return to kill the individual.”
Multiple government agencies told AFP Senegal that one Senegalese man (not two people) was briefly arrested on March 26 in Dalifort, an area in the country’s capital of Dakar, and that he was selling cosmetics and hadn’t actually tried to vaccinate anyone. An armed forces ministry spokesman said the mishap occurred because the man was wearing a health ministry T-shirt and jokingly said he had vaccines, causing a stir. Police found that he only had cosmetic products.
One website in Ghana, ezone57.com, ran the video under the headline: “Coronavirus: COVID-19 Vaccine Killed 7 Children in Senegal(West Africa) [VIDEO].” That post garnered considerable attention, and its headline appeared in screenshots on Facebook, before the website took down the story and published another debunking the claim.
The falsehood circulated amid news reports about controversial remarks made by two French doctors who suggested vaccine trials should be conducted in Africa.
World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus referred to those comments as “racist,” saying during an April 6 press conference that “Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.”
“We will follow all the rules to test any vaccines or therapeutics all over the world using exactly the same rule,” he said. “Whether it’s in Europe, Africa or wherever — we will use the same protocol.”

11,Alabama Officials Debunk False Claim of COVID-19 Vaccine Death,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/alabama-officials-debunk-false-claim-of-covid-19-vaccine-death/,,"A false claim that an unidentified nurse died after getting the COVID-19 vaccine in Alabama has been feeding into the anti-vaccine disinformation online. The Alabama Department of Public Health reported that no one who has received the vaccine has died.

Contrary to a claim circulating on social media, no nurses have died after getting the COVID-19 vaccine in Alabama.
More than 200 registered nurses across the country have died after getting the disease, though. That’s according to a report released in September by National Nurses United, the nation’s largest nurses’ union. As of Dec. 17, the total U.S. death toll was more than 300,000 and the total number of cases topped 17 million.
The falsehood about the death of an Alabama nurse started circulating shortly after doses began arriving in the state on Dec. 14. Health care workers were slated to be the first to receive the shots, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.
One vague claim posted Dec. 15 on Facebook said: “One of the first nurses to receive the vaccine in AL is now dead. We shall see how the media spins this.”
Another post that didn’t name the purportedly deceased person added some fictional specificity the following day, claiming: “A nurse in Alabama has died approx 8-10 hours after receiving her C-19 vaccine. Let’s see if the news picks it up and tells the truth.”
It also included this hashtag: #AntiVaccine.
The claim is baloney, though.
“[N]o persons who received COVID-19 vaccine in Alabama have died,” the state’s health department said in a press release responding to the claim. “The posts are untrue,” it said.
The department checked with every hospital in the state that had administered the COVID-19 vaccine and confirmed that there were no deaths.
As we’ve written before, no serious safety concerns have been reported regarding the currently available COVID-19 vaccine, although some health care workers who have taken the vaccine have had allergic reactions. (See “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” for more.)
During the trial phase, serious adverse events — which refer to potentially life-threatening or disabling events — occurred in fewer than 1% of participants, and at similar rates in those vaccinated and those not vaccinated. The few instances the Food and Drug Administration considered possibly related to the vaccine included one case of a shoulder injury and one instance of lymphadenopathy, or swelling of the lymph nodes, following vaccination.

12,Trump Ad Lifts Fauci Praise Out of Context,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-ad-lifts-fauci-praise-out-of-context/,,"A Trump campaign ad uses a clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci praising federal public health officials — saying that he “can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more” — and makes it seem like Fauci was personally complimenting the president. Fauci himself says the ad lifted his words “out of context.”
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has at times been critical when President Donald Trump has strayed from the guidance of public health officials. For example, Fauci has criticized some states for opening too quickly per Trump’s encouragement. He has also criticized the president’s mixed messages on wearing masks, and his insistence on holding large, densely packed rallies.
The new Trump ad begins with images of a masked Trump leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and returning to the White House, as the narrator says: “President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus and so is America.”
The narrator later says, “President Trump tackled the virus head-on, as leaders should.” It then immediately cuts to a clip of Fauci on camera saying, “I can’t imagine that … anybody could be doing more.”
Fauci’s comment came in an interview with Fox News host Mark Levin in late March.

Levin, March 23: Dr. Fauci, let me ask you a question. You’ve been doing this a long time. Have you ever seen this big of a coordinated response by an administration to such a threat, a health threat?
Fauci: Well, we’ve never had a threat like this and the coordinated response has been, there are a number of adjectives to describe it. Impressive, I think, is one of them. I mean, we’re talking about all hands on deck, is that I, as one of many people on a team, I’m not the only person, since the beginning that we even recognized what this was, I have been devoting almost full time on this, almost full-time.
I’m down at the White House virtually every day with the task force. I’m connected by phone throughout the day and into the night. When I say night, I’m talking 12, 1, 2 in the morning. I’m not the only one. There’s a whole group of us that are doing that. It’s every single day. So I can’t imagine that under any circumstances, that anybody could be doing more. I mean, obviously we’re fighting a formidable enemy, this virus. This virus is a serious issue here.
Though the ad implies Fauci was talking about Trump, Fauci never mentioned the president.
“In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,” Fauci said in an Oct. 11 statement to CNN. “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”
In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 12, Fauci said he thought the Trump campaign ought to take the ad down.
“I think it’s really unfortunate and really disappointing that they [officials in the Trump campaign] did that,” Fauci added. “And to take a completely out of context statement and to put it in which is obviously a political campaign ad, I thought was really very disappointing.”
In an Oct. 11 statement to NBC News, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh pushed back, responding: “These are Dr. Fauci’s own words. The video is from a nationally broadcast television interview in which Dr. Fauci was praising the work of the Trump administration. The words spoken are accurate, and directly from Dr. Fauci’s mouth.”
Trump later echoed that, writing on Twitter, “They are indeed Dr. Fauci’s own words. We have done a ‘phenomenal’ job, according to certain governors. Many people agree…And now come the Vaccines & Cures, long ahead of projections!”
They are Fauci’s words, but they are presented in a way to make it seem that Fauci was talking specifically about Trump and his response to the coronavirus when he says, “I can’t imagine … anybody could be doing more.”
However, in the context of the interview — as confirmed by Fauci himself — he is referring to the efforts of federal public health officials. Even though they are members of the Trump administration, that is not the same thing as praising Trump’s response, which has occasionally been at odds with the guidance of public health officials on everything from reopening states safely to wearing masks and holding rallies.
Since early April, public health officials with the Trump administration have been “clear and unambiguous,” as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar recently put it, in support of the public wearing masks when social distancing is not possible. But as we have written, Trump has repeatedly raised doubts about the science, noting that health experts who now advocate public mask-wearing were once opposed to it.
In July, Fauci said the president’s mixed messages on wearing masks were “not helpful.”
“But I can tell you, you’d have to say it’s not helpful if people get signals about not wearing masks when we are trying to get people to universally wear masks,” Fauci said. “My feeling about what we should do with masks is very, very clearly understood by everyone including those in the White House.”
Fauci also took issue with Trump repeatedly promoting the drug hydroxychloroquine, even though members of the administration’s coronavirus task force, including Fauci, warned that scientific studies did not support using the drug to treat COVID-19.
“We know that every single good study — and by good study I mean randomized control study in which the data are firm and believable — has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of COVID-19,” Fauci said in July.
As the president encouraged and prodded states to lift restrictions on business closures, Fauci faulted some states for opening too quickly, in contradiction of federal guidelines.
“There are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,” Fauci said in July.
Fauci singled out Florida as an example, saying, “Certainly Florida I know, you know, I think jumped over a couple of checkpoints.”
Trump repeatedly praised early-opening states, such as Florida, even when some failed to meet the federal guidelines for reopening safely.
Fauci also has been critical of Trump’s insistence on holding densely packed campaign rallies, two of them indoors, where many attendees didn’t wear masks.
In mid-June, as Trump was gearing up for an indoor rally in Tulsa, Fauci was asked if he would attend a Trump rally. “I’m in a high-risk category. Personally, I would not. Of course not,” Fauci, who’s 79, said.
In September, “CBS This Morning” host  Gayle King asked Fauci if the prevalence of attendees at Trump rallies not wearing masks was frustrating him. Fauci responded, “Well, yes it is. And I’ve said that often. That situation is, we want to set an example, because we know, we know, that when you do four or five typical kind of public health measures — masks, physical distance, avoiding crowds, making sure you do most things outdoors versus indoors — those are the kind of things that turn around surges, and also prevent us from getting surges.”
“Anybody who has been listening to me over the last several months knows that a conversation does not go by where I do not strongly recommend that people wear masks,” he said in an interview on Sept. 30 on ABC News’ “Start Here” podcast.
Fauci has at other times been complimentary of Trump’s willingness to follow the advice of federal public health officials in his administration. For example, on April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president’s response was, “Yes, we’ll do it.”
But as we said, Trump has not always been on the same page with federal public health officials. So when Fauci praises public health officials, saying he couldn’t imagine “anybody could be doing more,” that’s not the same as praising Trump, as the Trump ad suggests.",Robert Farley,2020-10-12 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"For example, on April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president’s response was, “Yes, we’ll do it.”

13,COVID-19 Isn’t Caused by Bacteria,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/covid-19-isnt-caused-by-bacteria/,,"
False information that claims COVID-19 is caused by a bacteria and can be easily treated started spreading by text message, and is now viral on social media. Actually, COVID-19 is caused by a virus and there is no treatment for it.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus that was first seen in China at the end of 2019 and has spread around the world, reaching pandemic proportions. There is currently no specific treatment for it or a vaccine to prevent it.
But a viral online claim misinforms social media users, telling them among other things: “Covid19 is a bacterium, easily treated with aspirin and coagulant.”
The claim started spreading as a text message — a Portuguese version circulating on WhatsApp was debunked by the Brazilian fact-checking organization Agência Lupa on May 15 and another version was debunked by India Today on May 25. But it has now migrated to social media platforms, including Facebook, where it’s spreading in popular American conspiracy theory groups.
The post circulating in U.S. groups claims that Italian authorities “allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium” and that they discovered this when “[t]hey went against the World Health Organization’s \’law\’ that no bodies be autopsied.”
None of that is true.
The Italian Ministry of Health describes the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, and the illness it causes, known as COVID-19, the same way as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. They all explain that the novel coronavirus is a newly recognized strain in the family of viruses known as coronaviruses, which includes the viruses that cause the common cold as well as more severe diseases, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.
The Italian ministry continues to refer to COVID-19 as a virus, not a bacteria.
Here, it’s important to understand the difference between bacteria and viruses. Bacteria are single-cell organisms that can live in various environments, including the human intestines, where they help to digest food, the Mayo Clinic explains. While some types of bacteria are harmless, or even helpful, to humans, others can cause diseases, such as strep throat. Bacterial infections can usually be treated with antibiotics.
Viruses, however, are smaller than bacteria and need a living host in order to multiply. They operate by taking over and hiding inside host cells. They cannot be treated with antibiotics.

The virus now known as SARS-CoV-2 was isolated on Jan. 7 in China and information about it was shared internationally for research purposes.
Illustrations of the virus have been ubiquitous over the last few months, too. They show the spiky crowns that are typical of the coronavirus family, which gets its name from the Latin word for crown.
So, the claim that Italian authorities discovered that “Covid19 is a bacterium, easily treated with aspirin and coagulant” is false. Not only does it misuse the name of the disease, it falsely suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a bacteria. Also, there is no treatment that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or recognized by the WHO.
The other part of the claim is also false. The WHO didn’t institute a “\’law\’ that no bodies be autopsied.”
But the Italian Ministry of Health, which is lauded in this claim for conducting autopsies, had actually sought to limit them for COVID-19 deaths, issuing guidance on April 1 that said autopsies should not be performed on those who died with “full-blown” cases of COVID-19.
The WHO published guidance in March detailing precautions to be taken while performing autopsies on those who died from COVID-19.
Generally, it said, dead bodies are not infectious, but warned that some organs of a person who died during the infectious period of COVID-19 could still contain the live virus. It recommended that autopsies be performed in adequately ventilated rooms with as few people present as possible, and that they all wear appropriate personal protective equipment.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2020-05-27 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"They all explain that the novel coronavirus is a newly recognized strain in the family of viruses known as coronaviruses, which includes the viruses that cause the common cold as well as more severe diseases, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.

14,"Trump’s Claims on IG, Wisconsin Election",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-claims-on-ig-wisconsin-election/,,"At the White House coronavirus task force press briefing on April 7, President Donald Trump distorted the facts about the person he dismissed as the chief watchdog for spending under the new pandemic relief legislation and the Wisconsin election, which took place as scheduled despite the coronavirus outbreak:

The president suggested he removed Glenn Fine as the Pentagon’s acting inspector general — preventing him from heading the pandemic relief spending oversight panel — because of Fine’s partisan background. But Fine is a career federal official who has worked under both parties.
Trump falsely claimed that Wisconsin Democrats acted at the 11th hour to postpone the state’s April 7 election after he endorsed Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly on April 3. In fact, Trump endorsed Kelly on Jan. 14; the Democratic governor acted because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pandemic Spending Watchdog
Asked to explain his decision to replace Fine, Trump started by saying he has been replacing inspectors general from “the Obama era” when the administration gets “reports of bias.”
“Well, we have … IGs in from the Obama era,” said Trump, using the common Washington shorthand for inspector general.
When he was told Fine wasn’t necessarily linked to President Barack Obama, Trump replied, “Maybe he was from Clinton.”
In fact, Fine has worked in federal government during both Republican and Democratic administrations and does not have a reputation as a political figure, but rather as an aggressive, independent investigator.
Fine became the Justice Department’s inspector general in 2000, under President Bill Clinton, and served in that role until 2011 during both terms of Republican President George W. Bush, finishing up under Obama, like Clinton a Democrat. After four years in private practice, he returned to the federal government under Obama.
Fine was named the Defense Department’s principal deputy inspector general on June 1, 2015. He became the Pentagon’s acting inspector general the following January and has spent three-and-a-half years in the Trump administration.
Fine, co-captain of Harvard’s basketball team and a 10th-round draft choice of the San Antonio Spurs, served as special counsel to the DOJ inspector general and as director of the special investigations and review unit under Clinton from 1995 to 2000.
Fine was named chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee on March 30. The committee’s mission is to oversee how money is spent under the recently enacted $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation. The panel’s members must be inspectors general. By dismissing him from the Pentagon IG position, Trump effectively relieved Fine from leading the pandemic spending committee.
On April 8, House Democrats introduced legislation that would allow Fine, who is now the Pentagon’s principal deputy inspector general, to chair the pandemic review committee.
In announcing Fine’s appointment, Michael Horowitz, chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, said, “Mr. Fine is uniquely qualified to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, given his more than 15 years of experience as an Inspector General overseeing large organizations.”
Fine’s former boss, James Mattis, who served as defense secretary under Trump, came to Fine’s defense after he was let go.
“Mr. Fine is a public servant in the finest tradition of honest, competent governance,” Mattis told Yahoo News in an email. “In my years of extensive engagement with him as our Department of Defense’s acting Inspector General, he proved to be a leader whose personal and managerial integrity were always of the highest order.”
Horowitz will head a group of inspectors general who will name a new head of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Replacing Fine as the Pentagon’s acting inspector general will be Sean O’Donnell, the inspector general at the Environmental Protection Agency, who retains his current position.
An oversight mechanism for the mammoth coronavirus relief aid package was a key demand from Democrats as the bill was negotiated.
Fine is not the only inspector general to come into Trump’s sights recently.
On April 3, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who told Congress about the whistleblower complaint, leading to Trump’s impeachment. And on April 6 Trump raised questions about Principal Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services because of her report that found shortages and testing delays at hospitals. Like Fine, Grimm is a career government official.
Wisconsin Election
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued an 11th-hour executive order to move the state’s April 7 election to June because of the coronavirus pandemic. Evers, a Democrat who had been under pressure from his own party for weeks to postpone the election, issued the order on April 6, seeking to delay the election until June 9 or a date that the governor and Republican Legislature could agree upon.
But the Republican state legislative leaders immediately went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the governor’s decision was unconstitutional. That ruling was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, allowing the election to take place on April 7.
Despite complaints of voter suppression, the election went off as planned. The state’s largest city, Milwaukee, had only five of its 180 polling places open, because of health concerns. In Green Bay, only two of its 31 polling places were open.
At his daily coronavirus press briefing, Trump said the U.S. Supreme Court properly allowed the election to take place as scheduled.
The president then falsely claimed that Wisconsin Democrats acted at the last minute to postpone the April 7 election not because of safety concerns but because he endorsed state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly “just the other day” on social media, referring to an April 3 tweet.
Trump, April 7: Of course they were right. Yeah. Look, the Supreme Court — well, of course they were right, because what the Democrats wanted — and you know why this happened. I supported a man named Justice Kelly, who’s — Daniel Kelly, highly respected justice. And I supported him just the other day — social media. I know of him. He’s a — just a, you know, fantastic judge, justice. And I endorsed him.
And as soon as I endorsed him, they wanted to move the election. They didn’t want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, “Oh, let’s move the election to two months later.” They didn’t mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting.
Now they talk about, “Oh, safety, safety.” Well, it was 15 minutes after I put out an endorsement that they said, “We have to move the election.” They didn’t want to move the election before that.
Trump leaves the impression that his April 3 tweet set in motion a last-minute attempt by Wisconsin Democrats to delay the election. In fact, Democrats were pressuring Evers to postpone the April 7 election for weeks, but the governor resisted and instead urged voters to vote by mail ballots.
For example, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, urged the governor on March 24 to hold the election by mail and suspend in-person voting.
Also, Trump endorsed Kelly on Jan. 14 at a rally, as the state Republican Party noted in a press release a day after the rally.
Republican Party of Wisconsin, Jan. 15: In case you missed it, President Donald J. Trump endorsed Justice Daniel Kelly for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court during his “Keep America Great” rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday. President Trump said, “Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to re-elect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly. Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin.”
The press release included a video of Trump’s endorsement of Kelly.
At the time, the conservative incumbent justice was running in a three-way nonpartisan primary against two “liberal-leaning challengers,” as the Associated Press described the race. The top two vote-getters in the February primary – Kelly and Jill Karofsky — advanced to the general election, which was held on April 7.
The state GOP supported Kelly, who was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association and state anti-abortion groups. Karofsky, his challenger, was endorsed by the state’s top Democrats, labor unions and women’s groups.
Trump did tweet on April 3 that Kelly has his “Complete Endorsement,” but that was the case back on Jan. 14. There is no evidence that that tweet had anything to do with attempts to move the date of the election.",Rem Rieder,2020-04-08 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"President Trump said, “Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to re-elect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly.

15,Union’s Search for Face Masks Gets Twisted Online,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/unions-search-for-face-masks-gets-twisted-online/,,"A meme falsely claims that a health care workers’ union was “caught hiding 39 million N95 masks,” and other posts cast suspicion on the union’s motives. In reality, the union had called medical suppliers nationwide in an effort to find masks — and it never had or hid them.

A California health care workers’ union launched a nationwide search on March 21 for face masks and other protective gear that have been in short supply since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the U.S. On March 26, the union announced that it had found a supplier with 39 million masks.
Within just a few days, that announcement had become a target of misinformation and suspicion.
First, some partisan websites suggested there was a connection between the union — Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West — and an announcement from Attorney General William Barr the same week. Barr warned that the Justice Department would pursue cases against those who are hoarding essential medical supplies.
There’s no evidence that the union’s announcement and Barr’s announcement are related. The SEIU-UHW began looking for the equipment on March 21, days before Barr’s March 24 announcement, and it never actually had possession of the masks.
Regardless, the suggestion was condensed into a meme from the conservative organization Turning Point USA that said: “Coincidence?? Just 3 days after A.G. Barr announced they’re going after hoarders… SEIU union in California suddenly found a mysterious stash of 39 million face masks.”
It’s been shared more than 11,000 times from Turning Point USA’s Facebook page and nearly 2,000 times from Iowa Rep. Steve King’s page, as well as other political pages.
Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, told us by email, “[N]othing definitive is stated in the meme, just asking the question, is this a coincidence? It doesn’t actually claim anything illicit or unethical, it just notes the timing is potentially suspicious. It also doesn’t say that the SEIU had the masks, but that ‘they found them’ in this case from a supplier.”
The more nuanced parts of that message weren’t clear to many of Turning Point USA’s social media followers, though. The group’s post garnered comments like this: “I just want to know how you FIND 39 million face masks and why in the HELL did they have them to begin with?”
Another meme went further, claiming: “SEIU was CAUGHT HIDING 39 MILLION N95 MASKS The SEIU only ‘found’ the much-needed masks after Atty. Gen. Barr threatened to file charges against them. People suspect SEIU was hiding the masks to cause a shortage / hurt Trump’s re-election.”
None of that is true.
The SEIU-UHW never had the masks. Rather, in an effort to answer the concerns of the health care workers the union represents, the SEIU-UHW started calling suppliers and distributors to locate equipment, according to the union’s announcement.
“We just started cold-calling potential suppliers because of the desperate need among the 97,000 healthcare workers we represent in CA and their co-workers, first responders, etc., and hit one who says he can get the masks,” the union’s spokesman, Steve Trossman, told us by email.
“To be clear, we are not selling masks, have never had possession of any masks, and have no financial interest in this,” Trossman wrote. “We are simply connecting hospitals and other entities that need [personal protective equipment] with suppliers we have found who say they have supplies.”
The U.S. has faced a shortage of face masks since COVID-19 began sickening Americans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization both recommend that, outside of health care settings, only those who are sick or caring for someone who is sick need to wear a mask. However, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who is also on the White House task force dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, recently said data that could suggest wider use of masks may help prevent the spread of the virus “is being aggressively reviewed.” The CDC has said that it currently has no plans to issue new guidance.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2020-03-31 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“We just started cold-calling potential suppliers because of the desperate need among the 97,000 healthcare workers we represent in CA and their co-workers, first responders, etc., and hit one who says he can get the masks,” the union’s spokesman, Steve Trossman, told us by email. “We are simply connecting hospitals and other entities that need [personal protective equipment  with suppliers we have found who say they have supplies.”

16,"Pfizer CEO Got Vaccinated, Contrary to Claim in Video",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-pfizer-ceo-got-vaccinated-contrary-to-claim-in-video/,,"A video making the false claim that the Pfizer CEO “refuses” to get a COVID-19 vaccine has been circulating on Facebook. But the pharmaceutical company’s chief executive has said that he’s gotten his first shot.

The chief executive officer for Pfizer, Albert Bourla, has gotten his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, he told Axios in early March.
But a video posted to Facebook on March 24 is blaring the false claim: “Pfeizer CEO refuses [vaccine],” with an emoji that looks like the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a syringe.
The video was shared by a page called “Tru York,” which has recently shared several other videos discouraging viewers from getting vaccinated. The page’s administrators are based in Canada and describe it as an “Entertainment Website · Political Party · Media/News Company.”
The video features a clip from an interview Bourla did with CNBC in December, in which he said that he would take the vaccine as soon as he could, but he didn’t want to set an example for “cutting the line” to get it earlier. Bourla described himself as “59 years old, in good health … not working on the frontline,” so he wasn’t prioritized for the shot.
Even though that statement is included in Tru York’s video, comments from viewers suggest that the written claim at the top of the video made a bigger impression. One such comment said: “TRANSLATION … I’m too rich and self important to kill myself taking a poison vaccine that I made.”
But, as we said, Bourla said in that interview that he intended to take the vaccine — and he has now gotten his first shot. So the claim that he “refuses” to take it is false.
The video also seems to suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was hesitant to get a COVID-19 test. The video shows Fauci saying in an interview, “I have no symptoms, there’s no reason for me to take a test.”
But that interview was from March 15, 2020, about nine months before the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to the first COVID-19 vaccine. At the time, testing for the disease wasn’t widely available.
CNN’s Brianna Keilar had asked Fauci if he would be tested following a public appearance where he had touched the same microphone and podium that had been touched by several other people.
“No, I’m not taking a test for the simple reason: I have no symptoms … I have been practicing pretty good social distancing,” Fauci said.
In an event that was covered by the media, Fauci received a COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 22. (See SciCheck’s articles on each vaccine: “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine“ and “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
As he was receiving his first shot, Fauci explained that he was taking the vaccine because he sees patients at the National Institutes of Health clinical center and “as important, or more important, as a symbol to the rest of the country that I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine and I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to get vaccinated so that we could have a veil of protection over this country that would end this pandemic.”

17,Trump’s Deceptive Comparison of the Coronavirus to the Flu,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-deceptive-comparison-of-the-coronavirus-to-the-flu/,,"A new book by journalist Bob Woodward shows that President Donald Trump sought to downplay the seriousness of the novel coronavirus despite the fact that he knew just how dangerous it was.
One way he did that was to liken the coronavirus to the flu, even though he told Woodward in early February that the coronavirus was far more lethal. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump misleadingly contrasted the total deaths of an entire flu season with very preliminary numbers for the coronavirus.
In a Jan. 28 intelligence briefing, Woodward writes in “Rage,” National Security Adviser Robert C. O’Brien told Trump that the virus would be the “biggest national security threat” he would face.
In taped interviews, Trump underscored to Woodward just how deadly the disease could be. In a Feb. 7 conversation, Trump told Woodward, “This is deadly stuff,” adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu. Trump said, “It’s also more deadly than your – you know, your, even your strenuous flus.”
Yet, as we have written, from Jan. 22 through March, Trump constantly minimized the danger of the disease. He often did so by comparing it to the flu, as he did at a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24.
Trump, March 24: I brought some numbers here. We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number — you know, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season. But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, “Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.” We have to get back to work.
Trump frequently said the disease would simply go away. On Feb. 10, he said, “You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in.”  
On March 19, Trump told Woodward he was understating the threat on purpose. “I wanted to always play it down,” he said, adding, “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”
There have been 6,354,869 coronavirus cases in the United States and 190,589 deaths as of Sept. 9, according to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center.
Despite knowing the severity of the threat, here’s what the president said in public remarks, interviews and tweets from Jan. 22 through March, often likening the novel coronavirus to the flu as a way of downplaying the danger.
Jan. 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” — Trump in a CNBC interview.
Feb. 10: “Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.” — Trump at the White House. (See our item “Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?“)
Feb. 26: “I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it that — and I spoke with Dr. [Anthony] Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it: The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And, so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery, one is — one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover, but the others are in great shape. But think of that: 25,000 to 69,000. Over the last 10 years, we’ve lost 360,000.” 
“This will end. This will end. You look at flu season. I said 26,000 people? I’ve never heard of a number like that. Twenty-six thousand people going up to 69,000 people, Doctor — you told me before. Sixty-nine thousand people die every year — from 26 [thousand] to 69 [thousand] — every year from the flu. Now, think of that. It’s incredible.”
“But when I mentioned the flu, I said — actually, I asked the various doctors. I said, ‘Is this just like flu?’ Because people die from the flu. And this is very unusual. And it is a little bit different, but in some ways it’s easier and in some ways it’s a little bit tougher.”
“But that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.” — Trump at a White House coronavirus task force briefing.
Feb. 27: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” — Trump at a White House meeting with African American leaders.
Feb. 28: “So a number that nobody heard of that I heard of recently, and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? Thirty-five thousand, that’s a lot of people. It could go to a hundred thousand. It could be 27,000. They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die, and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t. But think of it, you hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody. You wonder, the press is in hysteria mode.” — Trump at a rally in North Charleston, South Carolina.
March 4: “[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.” — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs.
March 4: “Now, with the regular flu, you know, we average from 27,000 to 77,000 deaths a year. Who would think that? I never knew that, until six or eight weeks ago. I asked that question. I said, how many people die of the flu? You know, you keep hearing about flu shot, flu shot, take your flu shot. But I said, how many people die of the flu? And they said, sir, we lose between 27,000 and, you know, somewhere in the 70s. I think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that. But a lot of people, regardless, I think it averages about 36,000 people a year. So I said, wow. And that’s — now, that’s a percentage that’s under 1% very substantially. So, it would be interesting to see what that difference is. But, you know, again, a lot of people don’t report, because they get the coronavirus, and they get better relatively quickly. Not that severe.” — Trump in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.
March 6: “We’ve had 11 deaths, and they’ve been largely old people who are — who were susceptible to what’s happening. Now, that would be the case, I assume, with a regular flu too. If somebody is old and in a weakened state or ill, they’re susceptible to the common flu too. You know, they were telling me just now that the common flu kills people and old people is sort of a target.” 
“Well, we’re considering different things [for dealing with the coronavirus]. But we’re also considering the fact that last year we had approximately 36,000 deaths due to what’s called the flu. And I was — when I first heard this four, five, six weeks ago — when I was hearing the amount of people that died with flu, I was shocked to hear it. Anywhere from 27,000 to 70,000 or 77,000. And I guess they said, in 1990, that was in particular very bad; it was higher than that.” — Trump after a tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
March 9: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” — Trump in a tweet.
March 10: “Look, right now, I guess we’re at 26 deaths, and if you look at the flu — the flu, for this year — we’re at 8 mil- — we’re looking at 8,000 deaths.  And, you know, hundreds of thousands of cases, but we have 8,000 deaths. So you have 8,000 versus 26 deaths, at this time. With all of that being said, we’re taking this unbelievably seriously, and I think we’re doing a really good job. And, again, the task force, headed up by the vice president, has been fantastic.”
“And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” — Trump after meeting with Republican senators.
March 13: Trump declares a national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus.

18,Video Spreads Bogus Claims About Plane Crashes and COVID-19 Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-video-spreads-bogus-claims-about-plane-crashes-and-covid-19-vaccines/,,"The number of U.S. plane accidents has been about the same this year as it was last year. But posts on social media falsely claim that there has been a significant increase due to pilot reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. The Federal Aviation Administration says it has seen “no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations” associated with COVID-19 vaccines.

The number of airplane accidents in the U.S. has remained steady over the last five years, even during the pandemic, according to data from the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all civil aviation accidents.

In 2020, the NTSB investigated 986 accidents, including 168 fatal crashes. In the previous four years, the NTSB investigated just over 1,000 accidents each year, including about 180 fatal accidents a year.
Accidents in the first nine months of this year rose slightly from the same time frame a year ago — 795 this year, 777 last year.
But misinformation peddlers are spreading the falsehood that there’s been a significant increase in accidents due to COVID-19 vaccinations, claiming that pilots have been suffering from side effects while flying.
“There’s a silent epidemic of plane crashes happening around the country and nobody is connecting the dots,” says the voice-over in one widely viewed video.
That video focuses on an Oct. 11 crash in Southern California in which the pilot of a small plane went down over a residential community, killing one person on the ground and injuring two others.
“It’s clear that the pilot was having a stroke,” the video claims. “The pilot was a doctor from a hospital and was required to get the vaccine. We know of many cases of pilots suffering strokes after getting the vaccine. That’s why they’re going on strike. It’s one of the many known side effects of this vaccine.”
But it’s not clear that the pilot had a stroke, nor is it true that strokes are a “known” side effect of COVID-19 vaccines. The most common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever, as we’ve explained before. In rare cases, the vaccines may cause more serious problems, such as anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction that has occurred in 2 to 5 people per million, according to the CDC. Such a reaction “can occur after any vaccination,” not just the COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC says. 
The FDA also has warned of an observed increased risk associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome and a blood clotting disorder coupled with low levels of platelets that has appeared almost exclusively in women below the age of 50. There is also emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle or of the surrounding lining, particularly in young men.
It’s also false that airline pilots have been striking — a claim we addressed in another story.
The investigation of the accident in California is ongoing, but there’s no evidence to suggest that the pilot, who also died, was having a vaccine-related reaction. While it’s true that the pilot was a doctor, it’s false that his employer required vaccination. Dr. Sugata Das worked at the Yuma Regional Medical Center, which does not currently mandate COVID-19 vaccination, a spokeswoman told us.
NTSB’s preliminary report makes no mention of the COVID-19 vaccine. When we asked the Federal Aviation Administration about the claim, a spokeswoman provided a statement saying, “The FAA has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with COVID-19 vaccines.”
It’s pure conjecture to claim that the pilot had a stroke. It’s an even further stretch to claim that the assumed stroke was related to vaccination, since strokes are not associated with COVID-19 vaccines. We could find no evidence of the pilot’s vaccination status.
The video then moves on to a clip from the conservative Stew Peters Show that featured Dr. Jane Ruby, who has made dubious claims about the COVID-19 vaccines before.
A Delta Air Lines pilot “died in flight within the last, I’d say, 10 days,” Ruby said on the Oct. 11 episode of the show, later claiming that the pilot had received his second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine “several days” earlier.
“The captain was speaking normally one moment, then said a few weird things, and then died,” she claimed. “They did land the plane safely.” She concluded, “So, guys, there’s a lot going on in the skies, there’s a lot of risk right now.”
But there’s no evidence to support the claim.
Delta issued a statement two days later, saying, “Delta is aware of reports suggesting one of the airline’s pilots passed away from vaccine complications while operating a flight, resulting in an emergency landing. All of these allegations are false.”
And, as we said, the FAA is unaware of any such situation.
We asked Ruby for evidence of her claims, but she didn’t provide any.
Ruby wears a white coat and stethoscope in her photos on social media and uses the title of doctor. She also filed paperwork in Florida for a company called “Dr. Jane Ruby” and runs a website under that name. However, she is not a physician.
When we asked Ruby about her credentials, she responded by email, “I’ve never claimed to be a medical doctor.”
Her LinkedIn page, which is no longer active, lists a doctor of education degree from the University of Rochester, which describes that degree as being more practical than a Ph.D. in education and explains that it is meant for those seeking school leadership roles.

19,Magnet Videos Refuel Bogus Claim of Vaccine Microchips,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-magnet-videos-refuel-bogus-claim-of-vaccine-microchips/,,"SciCheck Digest
The ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. are publicly available. Yet a false claim that the vaccines contain microchips is receiving renewed attention through a spate of videos of people claiming that magnets stick to their arms after vaccination. Experts say none of the ingredients would cause this supposed effect.
 How do we know what ingredients are in a vaccine?            
The full ingredient list for any authorized COVID-19 vaccine can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and in a variety of documents on the Food and Drug Administration’s website, including in a fact sheet for vaccine recipients that’s available in numerous languages. 
Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain messenger RNA, or mRNA; a variety of fatty molecules, or lipids, to protect the mRNA; and a few other ingredients, including salts and sugar, to keep the vaccine stable and at the proper pH, or balance of acidity and alkalinity. The Johnson & Johnson, or Janssen, vaccine contains a harmless adenovirus — a type of virus that typically causes the common cold — modified with the genetic material for SARS-CoV-2, as well as salts as stabilizing and buffering agents.
There are no preservatives, egg or latex in the vaccines.
Despite misconceptions about what is used to make COVID-19 vaccines, the ingredients for each vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are publicly available. As we’ve explained, readers can find the full ingredient list through Food and Drug Administration fact sheets for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

But a false claim that arose well before the vaccines began to roll out — that the shots contain “microchips” — is spreading online once again, this time with help from a round of videos purporting to show evidence.
In one video posted across social media platforms, a woman claims to show a magnet sticking to her arm — a result, she alleges, of a recent vaccination.
“Here’s the magnet. This is the arm I got the Pfizer shot in,” she says, placing what appears to be a small silver, circular magnet on her left arm. “And there it is.”
After it appears to stay in place, she then quickly hits the magnet against her other arm — “the arm that I didn’t get the shot” — and it falls to the ground. “You go figure it out. We’re chipped. We’re all f—ed.”
One Instagram post including that video was viewed more than 110,000 times. On TikTok, a similar video involving a Yoda magnet was liked more than 702,000 times before it was deleted.
There’s a lot we don’t know about the various videos, including whether the people in the videos were vaccinated, what magnets might have been used and whether other substances were used to make the objects stick.
But there is no support for the false claim that the vaccines contain “microchips” or ingredients that would result in such a magnetic effect.
We’ve debunked several false claims regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and supposed microchips. In April 2020, a conspiracy theory misinterpreted projects done by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to erroneously suggest that Bill Gates planned to use COVID-19 vaccines to “track people.”
Similarly, in December, a video swirling on social media wrongly claimed the vaccines contained a microchip that “tracks the location of the patient.” In reality, the claim was a distortion about a proposed technology for use on plastic vials that would track vaccine doses — not people.
Now, the videos involving magnets add new fuel to the same false narrative.
Lisa Morici, an associate professor at the Tulane University School of Medicine who studies vaccines, emphasized in an email that the “ingredients in the mRNA and adenovirus vaccines are simply RNA/DNA, lipids, proteins, salts, and sugars.” (The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use modified messenger RNA to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins, while the J&J vaccine uses an adenovirus modified with DNA for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.)
“All of these components are found in numerous foods, vaccines, and medicines,” she said.
“The ‘microchip’ is of course a myth being spread on social media,” she said. “‘Micro’ refers to the size of the chip = microns in size, whereas the mRNA and adenovirus vaccines are nanoparticles, meaning nanometers in size. The vaccines are therefore 1000x smaller than a microchip and a microchip couldn’t fit in the vaccine.”
As for the notion that vaccines could be responsible for a magnetic effect, two experts we contacted said none of the ingredients for the three vaccines would cause this supposed result.
“In order for a regular magnet to stick to something else magnetically, the something else should either possess significant magnetic remanence (like another magnet), or relative magnetic permeability significantly exceeding unity (like many refrigerator doors),” Mark Allen, a professor of electrical and systems engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. “According to the FDA fact sheets about the three FDA-authorized [COVID-19] vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J), none of the ingredients in any of the three vaccines contain any materials with these properties (significant magnetic remanence or relative magnetic permeability significantly exceeding unity.)”
He noted that “magnets wouldn’t stick to the silicon in silicon microchips either.” In short, he said: “Magnets won’t stick to you just because you have received a [COVID-19] vaccine.”
Randall Victora, head of the department of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Minnesota, further told us: “Although almost all materials are magnetic in the sense of paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and ferromagnetism, only a ferromagnet has the potential to make a magnet stick to your arm.”
Victora said “none of the listed ingredients in the Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson and Johnson vaccines are a ferromagnet, and thus they cannot cause a magnet to stick to your arm. Incidentally, most microchips do not have ferromagnetic components either.”
In one video viewed more than 10,000 times on YouTube, a man visits a store in Chicago called American Science & Surplus and shows a package of “rare earth magnets” sticking to his left arm. He encourages others to visit the store to “do this magnet challenge.”
Kristina Apostolou, the assistant manager at the store, told us that the man visited the store on May 12 to tape his video but said she couldn’t say what caused the magnets to stick to his arm.
During our phone interview, Apostolou, who said she has not received a COVID-19 vaccine, and a colleague, who she said did receive a vaccine in recent days, both attempted to recreate the “magnet challenge” with the same package. But “neither of us had the effect,” she said.
In another video on YouTube, the same man seen in the Chicago shop claims to show magnets sticking not only to the arm that he says he received a vaccine in — but his other arm, too.
Gustav Kuhn, a psychology researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London, who studies magic and illusions — and the president of the Science of Magic Association — also reviewed a handful of the videos for us. “It’s difficult, if not impossible to know why the magnet sticks in these situations,” he said in an email.
That said, he noted that there are simple, known sleights of hand that are not too dissimilar. One could use an adhesive such as sticky tape to make something appear as a magnet. There’s also a trick in which one makes it appear that a coin sticks to their head.
“It doesn’t rely on magnets [or] sticky tape,” he said. “You just push the coin to your forehead. You can try it yourself.”

20,Trump’s Missteps on COVID-19 Mortality,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/trumps-missteps-on-covid-19-mortality/,,"President Donald Trump exaggerated Americans’ comparative success battling the coronavirus, falsely saying in a press briefing that the U.S. per capita death rate is lower than “most” of Western Europe. He also claimed a 9% decrease in COVID-19 fatalities over the past week, but the data do not show such a decline.
The president made his comments in an Aug. 10 press briefing at the White House. After noting that the U.S. has more nursing home residents than the U.K. and other European countries, he turned to mortality rates.
Trump, Aug. 10: Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet, we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that’s an important — we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe, and heading for even stronger numbers.
Trump is right that the U.S., which has had about 50 deaths per 100,000 people, has a lower per capita death rate from COVID-19 than the U.K., which has had 70 deaths per 100,000. But he’s wrong when he adds the same is true of “most other nations in Western Europe.”
As of Aug. 12, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. has done better on cumulative per capita deaths than Belgium, Spain, the U.K., Italy and Sweden, as well as two tiny microstates — Andorra, located between France and Spain, and San Marino, which is surrounded by Italy.
But the U.S. also has done worse than France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Monaco, Austria, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Malta. That’s twice as many countries that outperform the U.S. on this particular death metric than those that underperform.

The following day, Trump altered his claim during a press briefing to exclude the New York tri-state area from the nation’s per capita death figures.
Trump, Aug. 11: We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-state area — which had a very, very hard time — and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill — something that the news doesn’t tell you. They don’t tell you that. They don’t like to tell you that.
It’s not clear why the president would remove New York, New Jersey and Connecticut from the country’s statistics and then compare the per capita rate to other countries that aren’t being given a similar handicap. Still, we found that when those three states are not included, the U.S.’s per capita mortality improves over only one additional country: France.
Without New York, New Jersey and Connecticut’s collective 52,794 COVID-19 deaths and nearly 32 million people, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Census Bureau figures, America’s mortality rate declines to around 37 deaths per 100,000 people. That’s better than France, but no better than the next Western European country, Ireland.
And while Trump says that the U.S. is “heading for even stronger numbers,” it’s worth noting that deaths per capita will only grow for nations as more deaths accumulate in ongoing outbreaks. Given that the U.S. currently has more daily per capita deaths than nearly all of Western Europe, it’s unlikely that the U.S. could improve its relative position anytime soon.
Underlying Conditions
Trump also suggests that the U.S. per capita death numbers are all the more impressive since the U.S. has “a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets.” 
We asked the White House for support for this claim, but did not receive a reply. We did, however, find a study that found the U.S. to be similar to Europe in terms of underlying conditions that put patients at higher risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19.
The study, which was published in June in the Lancet Global Health, estimated the number of people at increased and higher risk for COVID-19 in each country, based on age, sex and underlying health conditions such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease.
The authors found that 28.5% of the U.S. population has at least one health condition and is at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, while 5.8% of the population is at high risk. Compared with Europe as a whole, the U.S. is in a slightly better position, with 31% of Europeans at increased risk and 6.4% at high risk. Some countries in Europe fare a bit better than the U.S. on both numbers, such as Iceland and Ireland, but others do not, including the Netherlands and Germany (see this Excel spreadsheet for exact numbers).
Overstating Decrease in U.S. Fatalities
Shortly after his Western Europe claim, Trump touted American progress on the coronavirus.
“Nationwide, we continue to see encouraging signs,” he said. “In the last seven days, nationwide cases declined by 14%, hospitalizations decreased by 7%, fatalities decreased by 9%.”
Using figures from the COVID Tracking Project, we found the president to be close on cases and hospitalizations — but off on fatalities. The seven-day average of new coronavirus cases fell 12.5% between Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, although the seven-day average of new tests also declined 6.1%. Hospitalizations dropped 7.6%.
But for fatalities, the seven-day average declined by only 11 deaths, or 1%, from a daily average of 1,056 deaths to 1,045.
The White House did not explain the 9% figure or the data used in the president’s statistics. There are various metrics one can use, and different sources of similar data, which might explain some of the discrepancy, but we found none that matched 9%.
Data from USAFacts, which provides data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, show a 0.07% decline in the seven-day average of new deaths, while the New York Times database shows a 5.5% decline. Oxford University’s Our World in Data actually shows a 1.9% increase in the seven-day average of new deaths for the same time period.
On Aug. 11, Trump modified his claim downward, saying mortality in the U.S. “has declined by 7%.” The president isn’t explicit about the time period in question, but if he’s referring to a week-long period, as his comments suggest, data from the COVID Tracking Project show a 0.3% increase in the seven-day average in new daily deaths between Aug. 4 and Aug. 11. 
The real question is whether deaths in the U.S. are in fact trending down again, as they did in May and June, before rising in July as outbreaks swept across the South and West. And it may be too soon to tell.
As Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, previously told us, a week’s worth of data is not usually enough to establish a trend.
“[T]here can be week to week fluctuations in tests, cases and deaths, so it’s appropriate to see data from two weeks,” she said in an email, to know if a change represents a trend.
Two weeks prior, daily deaths were slightly below where they were on Aug. 10 and 11, and the seven-day average was still on the upswing, as a graph from the COVID Tracking Project shows.",Jessica McDonald,2020-08-12 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"But the U.S. also has done worse than France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Monaco, Austria, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Malta. But he’s wrong when he adds the same is true of “most other nations in Western Europe.”
As of Aug. 12, according to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. has done better on cumulative per capita deaths than Belgium, Spain, the U.K., Italy and Sweden, as well as two tiny microstates — Andorra, located between France and Spain, and San Marino, which is surrounded by Italy. On Aug. 11, Trump modified his claim downward, saying mortality in the U.S. “has declined by 7%.” The president isn’t explicit about the time period in question, but if he’s referring to a week-long period, as his comments suggest, data from the COVID Tracking Project show a 0.3% increase in the seven-day average in new daily deaths between Aug. 4 and Aug. 11. The study, which was published in June in the Lancet Global Health, estimated the number of people at increased and higher risk for COVID-19 in each country, based on age, sex and underlying health conditions such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease. “In the last seven days, nationwide cases declined by 14%, hospitalizations decreased by 7%, fatalities decreased by 9%.”

21,Trump’s Suspect Spanish Flu Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-suspect-spanish-flu-claims/,,"President Donald Trump recently said “close to 100 million people died” from the 1918 Spanish flu, and that “if you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying.” But 100 million is a high-end estimate of global deaths from that influenza pandemic, and we found no evidence the case fatality rate for those who had it was 50%.
Trump made those claims during a March 24 virtual town hall from the White House Rose Garden that aired on Fox News. He argued that the current coronavirus pandemic cannot be compared to the 1918 flu pandemic because of how deadly the latter was.
Trump, March 24: You can’t compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died. That was a flu, which — a little different. But that was a flu where if you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying.
I think we’re substantially under 1% because the people that get better are not reporting. So we only know people that go to doctors and go to hospitals, and we’re taking that. And we’re still a little bit above 1%. When you add all of the people — the millions of people that have it, that get better, we’re substantially less than 1%.
Trump has criticized the World Health Organization’s March 3 estimate of a 3.4% global case fatality rate for individuals with COVID-19, the pneumonia-like disease caused by the new coronavirus. The president called it “a false number” because it was based on known cases and fatalities and does not account for unreported cases. 
It’s not a false number, as we’ve explained before, but the fatality rate for COVID-19 may end up being much lower — perhaps less than 1% — when more data about the total number of people who had it is available.
Trump’s claims about deaths from the so-called Spanish flu, however, are more suspect. To start, he relied on one of the highest estimates of fatalities; others are lower.
In a 1991 report published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, K. David Patterson and Gerald Pyle estimated that between 24.7 million and 39.3 million people died worldwide during that pandemic — but the authors wrote that “we believe that approximately 30 million is the best estimate for the terrible demographic toll of the influenza pandemic of 1918.” 
The authors also noted that a much earlier, and much cited, estimate from 1927 put the death toll lower, at 21.6 million. 
Then in a 2002 report, also published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Niall Johnson and Juergen Mueller, referring to those earlier estimates, produced their own — 50 million deaths, globally — which they said may have been an underestimate by as much as 100%. “Consequently, the real pandemic mortality may fall in the range of 50 to 100 million,” they wrote.
It appears Trump was referring to that upper estimate.
But more recently, in 2018, Peter Spreeuwenberg, Madelon Kroneman and John Paget did their own analysis — which was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology — and concluded that “100 million deaths is highly unlikely.” Instead, “the true estimate,” the authors wrote, is “probably closer to our final estimate of 17.4 million deaths (1918 and 1919 combined).”
And even Johnson and Mueller, who estimated as many as 100 million deaths, said “it would seem unlikely that a truly accurate figure can ever be calculated.”
What we also don’t know for certain is how many people around the world contracted the Spanish flu. 
But if 500 million became infected, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, then those who contracted that influenza strain had a much lower chance of dying than Trump said, based on the previously discussed estimates of deaths.
For instance, if 17.4 million of 500 million infected people died, then the global case fatality rate was about 3.5%. If there were 30 million deaths, then the rate would be 6%. And even if the number of deaths was 50 million or 100 million, then the rate would be between 10% and 20%.
None of those equals a “50/50” chance of death, or a ratio “very close” to it.",D'Angelo Gore,2020-03-25 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"President Donald Trump recently said “close to 100 million people died” from the 1918 Spanish flu, and that “if you got it you had a 50/50 chance, or very close, of dying.” But 100 million is a high-end estimate of global deaths from that influenza pandemic, and we found no evidence the case fatality rate for those who had it was 50%.

22,"Fake Coronavirus Cures, Part 1: MMS is Industrial Bleach",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/fake-coronavirus-cures-part-1-mms-is-industrial-bleach/,,"Online posts have claimed to reveal various “cures” for the novel coronavirus. Some are benign, like eating boiled garlic, while others are potentially dangerous, like drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach. Neither will cure the virus.

Treatments billed as miracle cures have cropped up across the internet since the novel coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, at the end of December.
One rumor claims that boiled garlic can cure the virus. Another says that loading up on vitamin C will do the trick. Yet another would have people, essentially, drink bleach.
None of these “cures” will treat the virus.
We’re addressing each of these widely circulated claims in separate articles, starting with the most dangerous one — the claim that drinking chlorine dioxide will cure the virus.
Chlorine dioxide kits are sold online under various names — Miracle Mineral Solution, Miracle Mineral Supplement, Master Mineral Solution — but they are most often referred to as MMS.
These kits typically include a bottle of sodium chlorite and a bottle of an “activator” such as citric acid. When the two chemicals are mixed together, they make chlorine dioxide, a common industrial bleach used in the production of paper products, according to the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
But MMS hucksters sell the chemical solution as a cure-all for cancer, AIDS, autism and, now, the novel coronavirus.
One popular conspiracy theorist, Jordan Sather, wrote on Twitter: “‘NO KNOWN CURE FOR CORONAVIRUS’, they say. Well, it sure sounds like chlorine dioxide could wipe it out.” He directed his 116,000 followers to a website called Keavy’s Corner, which posted a banner at the top of its site telling customers, “We are experiencing high order volume that has us a few days behind on shipping.”
Keavy’s Corner, based in Florida, didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.
Another major proponent of MMS, Kerri Rivera, posted a story on her website under the headline: “Good News: Coronavirus Destroyed By Chlorine Dioxide.” Rivera primarily advocates for the use of MMS in treating autism. She was effectively barred in 2015 from selling chlorine dioxide for the treatment of autism in Illinois. But she is still active online and said in her recent post, “We already know CD is safe for ingestion by people, and has been used for helping the body heal from any number of health conditions including autism, malaria, herpes and AIDS.”
None of that is true. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies in the U.K., Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, have warned against the use of MMS.
In August 2019, the FDA issued this warning:
FDA, Aug. 12, 2019: Drinking any of these chlorine dioxide products can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration. Some product labels claim that vomiting and diarrhea are common after ingesting the product. They even maintain that such reactions are evidence that the product is working. That claim is false.
Moreover, in general, the more concentrated the product, the more severe the reactions. The FDA has received reports of consumers who have suffered from severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration, and acute liver failure after drinking these products. If you have had a negative reaction to any of them,  consult a health care professional as soon as possible.
While MMS is available on websites that look like herbal medicine dispensaries, like Keavy’s Corner, it is also described as a “sacrament” by an organization that calls itself the Genesis II Church.
Genesis II appears to have been one of the first major proponents of MMS. One of its founders, Jim Humble, claims to have discovered the solution in 1996 and Genesis II members push the use of MMS in online videos and self-published books, some of which are available on Amazon. Humble did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Shane Hawkins, who is listed as a reverend on the Genesis II website, was sued by the state of Texas and barred in 2017 from selling MMS. The state sued Hawkins after he charged $500 for admission to a series of “seminars” on the use of MMS at Houston-area hotels.
Hawkins isn’t the only person who has been to court for the sale MMS. Louis Smith, of Spokane, Washington, faced criminal charges in federal court for selling MMS on a website called Project GreenLife. He was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to more than four years in prison.
And, in 2018, Stanley Nowak pleaded guilty in Canadian court to selling MMS, an unauthorized drug under Canadian law.
Despite warnings from government health agencies and legal consequences for direct sellers, pitches for MMS continue to get attention in conspiracy-theory and anti-vaccine circles online.
That’s likely because, like a lot of long-running conspiracy theories and scams, there’s a grain of truth to MMS. Chlorine dioxide is used as a disinfectant in municipal water treatment, so people can ingest trace amounts of the chemical. But the Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum allowed level of 0.8 milligrams per liter. The dropper bottles used for MMS, however, serve 3 to 8 milligrams per drop, according to one medical journal. Humble recommends drinking six drops in a half-cup of water and then drinking the same amount an hour later to treat the coronavirus. That’s about 200 to 500 times the maximum amount set by the EPA.
The effect of drinking higher amounts of chlorine dioxide from MMS kits has been documented in medical journals by doctors who have treated patients who drank it. A 75-year-old man in New York who tried to treat his prostate cancer with MMS ended up spending four days in the hospital and received a blood transfusion. A 2-year-old in Nashville drank from a bottle of MMS and was twice hospitalized, requiring two blood transfusions. And a 27-year-old woman in Birmingham, Alabama, accidentally drank two-and-a-half ounces of MMS instead of two drops and spent two days in the hospital.
The FDA has warned against using MMS since 2010 and reiterated in a statement to FactCheck.org that “the FDA recommends consumers do not ingest these products.” The statement, provided by spokesperson Jeremy Kahn, went on to say, “We understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options.”",Saranac Hale Spencer,2020-02-11 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"In August 2019, the FDA issued this warning:

It actually shows an aardvark, which is the name of the company that designs and manufactures the trucks.

Conspiracy theorists skeptical of COVID-19 have mistaken an aardvark for an ancient Egyptian deity.
A photo collage circulating on QAnon message boards and Facebook groups makes the claim that the logo on a COVID-19 mobile testing unit depicts Anubis, the Egyptian god of embalming.
“Why does the COVID-19 testing facility have a logo of Anubis the god of Death?” asks the text above an array of photos that includes a COVID-19 testing truck, an image of Anubis, and a circled image of the logo.
But the logo actually belongs to Aardvark Mobile Health, a division of Aardvark Mobile Tours, which started making the trucks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The logo for that company is, you guessed it, a head-on view of an aardvark.
“The logo for Aardvark Mobile Tours was created in 2007 and includes the Aardvark head – which is what you see in the COVID-19 testing logo,” spokeswoman Carolyn Lang told FactCheck.org in an email.
The company currently operates testing trucks in the Miami area, Lang said. Florida has been a hotspot for COVID-19, with more than 73,000 new cases reported in the last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The company’s chief executive officer, Larry Borden, chose Aardvark as the company name because the double “A” would put it at the beginning of the phone book, Lang said.
Aardvarks are nocturnal African mammals that feast on bugs. Anubis is an ancient Egyptian deity who is often portrayed with the head of a jackal. Both have a snout and tall ears.

But some prominent conservative purveyors of misinformation in the U.S. have made false claims about vaccination efforts and the impact of the pandemic in Afghanistan.

Health care workers have administered just under 2 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in Afghanistan, which has a population of about 39 million. Vaccination rates slowed further in August amid upheaval as U.S. troops pulled out of the country and the Taliban took over.
There was an 80% drop in the number of Afghans provided with the opportunity to receive COVID-19 vaccines in August, Tess Ingram, a spokeswoman for UNICEF, told us by email. UNICEF is handling the delivery of vaccines for the COVAX consortium that provides COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.
“COVID vaccine administration has slowed in the last month but hasn’t stopped completely,” Ingram said of the situation in Afghanistan.
But, as partisan rhetoric about the pull-out intensified, two prominent purveyors of misinformation made false or misleading claims about Afghanistan’s low vaccination rate and used those claims to suggest that vaccines aren’t necessary to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ted Nugent, a musician who frequently shares conservative political commentary on social media and has made false claims undermining the COVID-19 vaccines, posted a meme on Facebook that asked, “Can someone tell me how the Taliban survived the last 18 months with no vaccines … to then recapture an entire country with no mass deaths amongst their population during a global pandemic?”
And Candace Owens, a conservative commentator who has been vocal about her aversion to the COVID-19 vaccine, tweeted: “Afghanistan has vaccinated approximately 2.4% of their population. (Source: Reuters) They are a nation of about 40 million people. Why aren’t they all dead? Why have they only recorded 7,083 deaths? Bigger question: Why is the Taliban banning the vaccines?”
The Taliban and the COVID-19 Vaccines
We’ll start with Owens’ claims.
There’s no evidence to support the claim that the Taliban is “banning the vaccines.” We reached out to Owens on her Facebook page and through her website to ask what her claim was based on, but she didn’t respond.
At the beginning of 2021, the Taliban gave its support to the COVID-19 vaccination drive backed by COVAX, and a Taliban spokesman told Reuters that the group would help “facilitate” the effort.
The Middle East Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., called the Taliban’s attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine “a departure from its usual position against immunization programs.” It noted that the Taliban has rejected vaccination programs in the past, including an effort to eradicate polio. Afghanistan is one of only two countries where polio is endemic, according to UNICEF.
Although the Taliban has said that it supports the COVAX effort, it appears to have interfered in some instances. In March, the group seized a shipment of COVID-19 vaccines in the northern province of Faryab, according to the vaccine alliance Gavi, one of the COVAX partners. And in August, an Afghan news outlet reported that the Taliban had shut down a COVID-19 vaccine distribution ward in the eastern province of Paktia.
But health care workers and aid organizations appear to be operating under the assumption that COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be available.
Sabrina Sidhu, another UNICEF spokeswoman, told us by email, “The [government] Health Commission, earlier this week, asked all health facilities to open, and all doctors, nurses and health workers, including women, to come back to work.” Also, a World Health Organization report issued on Sept. 2 said, “There is an urgent need to scale-up the COVID-19 response, especially vaccination.”
So, the Taliban does have a history of eschewing vaccination and reportedly has interfered in some instances with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. But we could find no evidence that the group has issued a ban at this point. Instead, we found that it has publicly stated support for the effort.
As for the claim in Nugent’s meme that there have been “no vaccines,” that’s clearly false, since the WHO has reported that just under 2 million doses have been administered.
Reporting COVID-19 Deaths in Afghanistan
The posts also suggest that the relatively low number of reported deaths from COVID-19 in Afghanistan indicate that vaccines aren’t necessary, which is at odds with data from countries that have widespread vaccination and death reporting programs.
The U.S., for example, saw a decline from a seven-day moving average of 2,703 deaths on Dec. 11 — the date on which the Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine — to a low of 191 on July 8. There has been an increase in cases and deaths in the U.S., since the more transmissible delta variant became the most prevalent form of the virus.
But Afghanistan doesn’t have a national death register. That fact, paired with a lack of people being tested and limited public health resources generally, means that “confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 are likely to be under-reported overall in Afghanistan,” a July report from the WHO and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.
Contrary to the social media posts, which downplay the severity of the COVID-19 situation in Afghanistan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put the risk level for traveling to the country at 3, or “high,” the second-highest level.
The U.S. embassy in Afghanistan, which is no longer operational, posted on its website, last updated Aug. 31: “New cases and deaths from COVID-19 have risen sharply throughout Afghanistan. Hospitals are reporting shortages of supplies, oxygen, and beds for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related patients. U.S. citizens have reported being denied admittance to hospitals due to lack of space.”",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-09-10 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Sabrina Sidhu, another UNICEF spokeswoman, told us by email, “The [government  Health Commission, earlier this week, asked all health facilities to open, and all doctors, nurses and health workers, including women, to come back to work.” Also, a World Health Organization report issued on Sept. 2 said, “There is an urgent need to scale-up the COVID-19 response, especially vaccination.”

25,Both Sides Spin CBO Report in COVID-19 Relief Debate,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/both-sides-spin-cbo-report-in-covid-19-relief-debate/,,"In the debate over competing rescue plans, those in both political parties have miscited a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office to make their case.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy suggested the unemployment benefits in the Democratic package were unnecessarily generous “because the Congressional Budget Office says they expect employment to be back to pre-COVID levels by June.” The CBO says that without any new stimulus, employment will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, pointing to the same CBO study, claimed, “A CBO report found that without any additional stimulus, our economy wouldn’t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025.” The CBO concluded that without additional stimulus, the real gross domestic product would return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-year this year.

Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that while the statements by Cassidy and Psaki are “both technically wrong, I think it’s pretty clear they are both trying to say something accurate.”
Republicans and the White House have proposed very different COVID-19 relief bills, with the Republican plan calling for about $618 billion in stimulus, while the plan proposed by President Joe Biden calls for $1.9 trillion in federal spending. Biden met with a group of 10 Senate Republicans on Feb. 1, and both sides presented arguments for their respective packages.
In an interview after the meeting, Cassidy said the two sides had a “bit of common ground” in that “we’re talking from data. What does the data show that we need. And the president’s going to have his staff get back to us, and we’ll kind of compare our data points. That’s good news.”
In making their cases through data, both sides cited a recently released report from the CBO on the 10-year economic outlook. But as we said, they didn’t always do so accurately.
Cassidy’s Claim
One of the differences between the two relief plans is the amount and duration of unemployment insurance supplements. Biden’s American Rescue Plan would provide a $400 per week unemployment insurance supplement through the end of September. The GOP proposes that the current $300 per week supplement be extended through the end of June.
Biden “wants $400; we gave $300. And we phase out in June. Why? Because the Congressional Budget Office says they expect employment to be back to pre-COVID levels by June,” Cassidy said in a Feb. 2 interview.
In another interview the same day on CNBC, Cassidy said, “CBO is estimating a GDP growth of 3.8% this coming year. CBO is saying that by June, employment will be back to pre-COVID levels, attributing that to these COVID packages we’ve already had.”
That’s not accurate. According to the CBO report, without any new relief package at all, “the unemployment rate gradually declines through 2026, and the number of people employed returns to its prepandemic level in 2024.”
Cassidy’s office said the Louisiana senator in both cases was referencing GDP, not employment.
That would be accurate. The CBO wrote, “In its new economic forecast, which covers the period from 2021 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office therefore projects that the economic expansion that began in mid-2020 will continue. … Specifically, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to return to its prepandemic level in mid-2021 and to surpass its potential (that is, its maximum sustainable) level in early 2025.”
In a press briefing on Feb. 3, Psaki said, “The president’s plan would give Americans who are out of work, through no fault of their own, a $400 weekly supplement and the certainty that it would last through the worst of the pandemic. Their plan would give unemployed Americans less money and, therefore, less certainty.”
We’re not going to weigh in on the politics over the appropriate amount or duration of unemployment insurance supplements. But even if Cassidy had cited the GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels later this year to justify the GOP’s smaller and shorter unemployment insurance proposal, we would have been writing now to clarify that CBO anticipates unemployment recovery to be slower than GDP recovery by several years.
The same thing happened after the Great Recession when unemployment recovery lagged behind GDP growth.
Psaki’s Claim
Psaki has also cited the CBO report, to justify the size of the $1.9 trillion package proposed by Biden. She argues that without it, the economy will not recover as quickly.
In her press briefing on Feb. 4, Psaki said: “A CBO report found that without any additional stimulus, our economy wouldn’t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025. And it would take just as long to get back to full employment.”
She said something similar on Feb. 2. Psaki said the CBO analysis showed that “without action, our economy won’t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025. That’s too long. So our goal with moving this package forward is making it faster.”
As we wrote above, the CBO projects that GDP will “return to its prepandemic level in mid-2021.” Psaki is referring to something else, what the CBO refers to as the economy’s “potential level” — which CBO describes as its “maximum sustainable” level. CBO says GDP won’t surpass that level until 2025.
“’Potential GDP’ is a measure of how much the economy could produce if we were maximizing our use of labor and capital,” Goldwein, of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, explained.
“Prior to the pandemic, the economy was at its potential – actually somewhat above potential based on CBO’s estimates,” Goldwein said. “In the second quarter of 2020, the economy fell to about 10% below its potential according to CBO. In other words, thanks to the pandemic we were producing and buying 10% less than we could have been.”
“Potential GDP almost always grows over time,” Goldwein said, but since the second quarter of last year, “actual GDP has been growing faster and so catching up.”
“CBO estimates the gap shrank from 10.1% at its worst to 3% at the end of last year and will further shrink to 1.3% by the end of this year, 0.8% by the end of 2022, 0.4% by the end of 2023, and 0.015% by the end of 2025,” Goldwein said.
Although the economy would not reach its potential until the first quarter of 2025, according to CBO, Goldwein noted that it would be “mostly back to normal (within 0.5% of potential) by 2023.”
In an analysis of Biden’s plan, CRFB calculated that the $1.9 trillion proposal would “likely be enough to close the output gap” between actual and potential GDP “two to three times over.” That “overshoot could be beneficial” the report states, but the authors also warned it could “pose risks to the economy and the fiscal outlook.”
“While the economy can operate above its long-term potential for periods of time, it cannot do so indefinitely or sustainably,” the authors wrote. “One possibility is that the excess funds are economically ineffective, adding to the debt without improving the economy.” The excess stimulus could also lead to higher inflation, the report states, and could lead to “an economic cliff or crash as the stimulus fades.”

In a press briefing on Feb. 3, Psaki said, “The president’s plan would give Americans who are out of work, through no fault of their own, a $400 weekly supplement and the certainty that it would last through the worst of the pandemic. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, pointing to the same CBO study, claimed, “A CBO report found that without any additional stimulus, our economy wouldn’t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025.” The CBO concluded that without additional stimulus, the real gross domestic product would return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-year this year. Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that while the statements by Cassidy and Psaki are “both technically wrong, I think it’s pretty clear they are both trying to say something accurate.”
Republicans and the White House have proposed very different COVID-19 relief bills, with the Republican plan calling for about $618 billion in stimulus, while the plan proposed by President Joe Biden calls for $1.9 trillion in federal spending. So our goal with moving this package forward is making it faster.”

26,Video Twists Advice on Delta Variant and Vaccination,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-video-twists-advice-on-delta-variant-vaccination/,,"An epidemiologist recommended that people get the COVID-19 vaccine because some evidence suggests an unvaccinated person who gets the delta variant is “twice as likely to require hospital treatment” than someone infected with the alpha variant. But a Facebook video twists that advice to claim that he said vaccinated people would be twice as likely to be hospitalized.

Studies indicate that currently available vaccines are largely effective against the delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. But a video circulating on Facebook wrongly tells viewers the opposite.
The video is part of a series of similar webcasts from Jen DePice, a Philadelphia-area chiropractor who has used Facebook to advocate against the vaccines. Another video in the series, for example, is pinned to the top of her organization’s page with this message: “JUST SAY NO…to the Jab!🗽❌💉“
The video we’ll address here has been viewed 48,000 times and has garnered comments such as, “Best news as I’ve not been VAC & have no plans to be.”
In the video, DePice claims that those who are exposed to the delta variant are “twice as likely to require hospitalization if the person was vaccinated.”
There is no support for this statement, and, as we noted, studies have shown the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. are largely effective against the delta variant.
Although DePice says that her claim is based on research “from Harvard,” we could find no such study, and she didn’t respond to a message on her Facebook account asking for further details.
However, it appears that she misrepresented an interview with a Harvard University professor.
The post accompanying the video links to an interview Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health posted with William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology.
In that July 8 interview, Hanage said (emphasis added), “Delta’s greater virulence means that unvaccinated people who become infected will be sicker and the burden on the health care system will be greater. Evidence suggests, for example, that an unvaccinated person with Delta infection is roughly twice as likely to require hospital treatment than a person infected with the previously dominant variant.”
Hanage’s point is supported by a Scottish study published in June that found the risk of hospitalization was about twice as high for those with the delta variant compared with those with the previously dominant alpha variant, but the finding was preliminary.
As we’ve explained, it’s not yet settled whether the delta variant causes more severe disease than other versions of the virus. Public Health England, for example, posted an assessment on July 23 saying that the delta variant appeared to increase the risk of hospitalization relative to alpha, but that there was a “low” level of confidence about this.
But, as far as DePice’s claim is concerned, it appears that she has misrepresented what Hanage said about what group is at higher risk to be hospitalized.
She also failed to convey what Hanage said about the value of vaccination against COVID-19 generally.
Hanage clearly advised in that interview: “Get vaccinated if you are not already.”
He explained that the high transmissibility of the delta variant means that the virus can spread faster than the rate of vaccination around the world. This variant also appears to produce high viral loads early in infection, he said, “which may mean that it’s even more infectious during the period when people don’t yet realize they’re infected.”
A July study from China that has yet to be peer reviewed found that the viral load for those infected with the delta variant was 1,000 times higher than for those who had the original strain of the virus.
Hanage also noted in the interview that the delta variant appears to be more able to cause “so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people.” But, he said, the resulting infections are “comparatively mild.”
In the U.S., the delta variant accounted for 83% of COVID-19 cases for the two weeks ending July 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated. And on July 16, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said at a press briefing that more than 97% of those who were hospitalized were unvaccinated.
As we said, the vaccines appear to be effective against the delta variant, but several studies have emphasized the importance of getting the full dosage of the vaccine if two shots are required, as is the case for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-07-27 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Hanage also noted in the interview that the delta variant appears to be more able to cause “so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people.” But, he said, the resulting infections are “comparatively mild.”

27,"Testing, By the Numbers",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/testing-by-the-numbers/,,"Flanked by large signs proclaiming, “America leads the world in testing,” President Donald Trump said at a May 11 press conference, “we’ve prevailed on testing.” While the United States has done more total tests for COVID-19 than any other country, it doesn’t lead when testing is measured by other metrics.
At the same press briefing, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, who is in charge of the government’s testing efforts, said: “No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing.” Let’s take a look.
Total Number of Tests
As he has stated repeatedly, Trump touted the total number of tests conducted in the U.S. as being the most of any country in the world. “This week the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted, nearly double the number of any other country,” he said.
It’s true that the U.S. — by far — has conducted the most tests for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as measured in raw numbers. In the press conference, Giroir showed a graph, similar to the one below, by Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford, that demonstrated this.

As of May 11, the U.S. had conducted 9.35 million tests. The country with the second-highest number was Russia, with 5.8 million tests, as of May 12.
We’d note that Our World in Data cautions comparisons of different countries may not be apples-to-apples. It notes: “[T]here are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units, whether or not all labs are included, the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects.” 
Per-Capita Tests
But the U.S. has a much larger population than most countries, which would make a per-capita comparison a better gauge of countries’ testing efforts. As we’ve explained before, testing a higher proportion of the population increases the ability to control the spread of COVID-19, making the per-capita metric an important one.
Both Trump and Giroir cited per-capita measures, but made misleading claims, leaving out countries that have done better than the U.S. in this regard.
“We’re testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland and many other countries, and in some cases combined,” Trump said.
After Giroir showed the graphic on total tests, he said: “If you look at per capita, everyone talks about South Korea being the standard, today we will have done more than twice their per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in South Korea. No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing.”
But he didn’t show a per-capita graph such as the one below, which refutes the idea that the U.S. leads “no matter how you look at it.”

The U.S. was at 26.31 tests per 1,000 people as of May 9. That’s more than South Korea, but less than Iceland, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, Austria, Australia, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Russia and Spain, among others. Worldometer, a data aggregation website, listed 39 countries and territories with higher per-capita testing rates than the U.S. as of May 12.
South Korea used to have a higher per-capita testing rate, when Trump first made misleading comparisons to the country in late March. It’s noteworthy that the U.S. did ramp up testing and, by April 17, surpass South Korea by this measure. But the two countries reported their first cases of COVID-19 around the same time, on Jan. 20 and 21. Yet South Korea began aggressively testing earlier than the U.S., as this graph shows. 

South Korea has been held up as an example, as Giroir mentioned, of how early testing can enable countries to identify and isolate cases, flattening the curve. While the U.S. is now doing more testing, the two countries are at different trajectories in the spread of the disease. Line graphs on the number of confirmed cases show the U.S. on a sharp curve up, beginning in late March, while South Korea’s cases spiked earlier, in late February and early March — and the number remained relatively flat through April.
Economic researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis noted in an April 22 paper that South Korea’s early testing “seems to have paid off,” while U.S. “inaction” resulted in more confirmed COVID-19 cases.
“Testing early and often seems to have paid off for South Korea,” the St. Louis Fed researchers wrote. “The weeks lost due to inaction in the United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rationing of tests to those with severe symptoms. Thus, the United States had a large number of confirmed cases relative to South Korea.”
Tests Per Confirmed Case
Another way of comparing countries is by the number of tests each has performed per confirmed case. By this measure, the U.S. lags far behind most nations, according to Our World in Data.
The map below shows that the U.S., as of May 9, had done only about seven tests per confirmed case — far fewer than South Korea (61), Russia (28), Canada (16) and Japan (14), for example. (Note: The data is updated regularly, so use the slider to change the date to May 9.)

Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told us for a previous story that per-capita test numbers are “not as informative as looking at testing per positive infection identified.” 
Comparing the U.S. to South Korea, for example, Shaman said, “They’re testing 10 times as many per infection found.”
We downloaded the data for May 9 and found that the U.S. ranked 59th out of 64 countries in tests per confirmed case as of that date.
In April, the Rockefeller Foundation issued a “testing action plan” that called for “rapidly expanding testing capacity to 30 million tests per week over the next six months” in the U.S.
CNBC, April 21: The Rockefeller plan says that more testing must be done to accurately capture the level of Covid-19 infections in the U.S.
“In Taiwan, there have been 132 tests conducted for every confirmed case. In Australia, the number is 62. In the United States, it is five,” an executive summary of the plan notes.
As of May 9, the U.S. has conducted about seven tests for every confirmed case, while Taiwan has conducted about 153.
We can also look at this measure in percentage terms: the test positivity rate, or the share of total tests that are positive.
As we wrote recently, if a high percentage of tests are positive, that suggests only the sickest patients are being tested and mild cases are likely being missed, a Johns Hopkins website explains. The World Health Organization has recommended that countries aim for about a 10% test positivity rate to make sure there’s enough testing being conducted to detect all cases. 
The U.S. is now at a 14.2% test positivity rate as of May 11.

28,Trump’s Dubious Claim That He’s Not Contagious,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trumps-dubious-claim-that-hes-not-contagious/,,"Less than a week after being hospitalized due to COVID-19, President Donald Trump now says, “I don’t think I’m contagious at all.” But according to medical experts and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the president may very well still be contagious and ought to be isolated.
In a phone interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business on the morning of Oct. 8, Trump said he was feeling good and looking forward to resuming campaign rallies.
“I think I’m better to a point where I’d love to do a rally tonight, I wanted to do one last night, but I think I’m better to a point that I feel better than I did you know, I jokingly said 20 years ago, I feel perfect,” Trump said. “There’s nothing wrong. I had a case, I got it knocked out.”
“I don’t think I’m contagious at all,” Trump added. “Well, first of all, if I’m at a rally I’d stand by myself very far away from everybody, whether I was or not. But I still wouldn’t go to rally if I was contagious.”
Trump may not think he is contagious, but according to the CDC “persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset.” People with more severe illness may be infectious longer than that.
The CDC recommends that, “For most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.”
Trump announced very early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus. In a press conference later that morning, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing “mild symptoms.” Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he spent three days getting treatment before being discharged back to the White House on Oct. 5.
In an Oct. 7 memo, Trump’s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said the president has “now been fever-free for more than 4 days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed or received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization.”
Still, Trump’s statement that he no longer believed he was contagious came just seven days after he first began to experience symptoms. In an interview on MSNBC, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the president’s pronouncement was premature.
“Well, you know the general guideline from the CDC says that 10 days from the onset of symptoms, that you can essentially consider someone noninfectious,” Fauci said. “You can definitively show that by another one of the recommendations that had been made about two negative PCR tests, 24 hours apart. So if the president goes 10 days without symptoms and they do the test that we were talking about, then you could make the assumption, based on good science, that he is not infected. But you just have to wait and make sure you go through those particular benchmarks that are delineated in the CDC guidelines.”
In a press call on Oct. 7, the day before Trump said he thought he was no longer infectious, Dr. Roger Shapiro, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that patients with “mild or even moderate disease” may be “rendered non-infectious in about 10 days just by natural course of the illness and immune control that would be expected for most individuals.”
“However,” he said, “people with more severe disease can remain infectious for 20 days or even longer.”
There is “a real possibility” Trump fits in that latter category, Shapiro said, “and it might be made even greater by the fact that President Trump received steroids.” Steroids, he added, can be “very helpful in reducing mortality, especially late in the illness,” but “we don’t yet know the effect that they may have in terms of prolonging the shedding of virus.”
On Oct. 4, Conley said that Trump had experienced “two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation,” indicating Trump’s lungs may be compromised. As a result, the president began to take dexamethasone, a steroid drug.
“It really depends on how severe his COVID is,” Shapiro said. “And that is a matter of some debate right now. … It is unclear whether he is in a more moderate category or whether he really tipped over towards a severe disease, which would be suggested by the fact that he received the dexamethasone for his illness.”
“So I think it’s still is a real unknown as to whether or not, President Trump will be shedding virus in the middle of next week,” Shapiro said.
Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, told CNBC the president’s comments are “truly unbelievable” and the fact that he is considering holding a rally is “mind blowing.”

“Just less than a week ago, the president was in a hospital being treated for severe illness,” said Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University. “It’s very likely that he’s still shedding virus right now.”
Dr. Syra Madad, senior director of the systemwide special pathogens program at New York City Health + Hospitals, told CNBC the president ought to isolate for at least 10 days, per the evidence-based CDC guidance.
“If [Trump’s] not going to isolate for that full period when he may be infectious, then, as a doctor, why would we tell other people to do the same,” Madad said. “Why should they listen to us when the president of the United States isn’t abiding by his own public health measures?”

29,Video: Trump’s Repeated Coronavirus Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/video-trumps-repeated-coronavirus-claims/,,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly misstated the facts at the White House coronavirus briefings.
In this video, we feature five examples from our story “An April Filled With Repeats.”

Not a “travel ban.” At least four times in April, the president said he had imposed a “travel ban” on China or “closed the border.” But the Trump administration’s travel restrictions stopped well short of a “ban.” The policy, which took effect Feb. 2, prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S., but the new rules don’t apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members. 
Misleading claims of a “broken system.” Throughout April, Trump repeatedly claimed he had “inherited a broken system” of testing from previous administrations. Once, he referred to it as a “broken test.” As we explained, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alone couldn’t conduct the amount of testing this pandemic demanded, but it was never designed for that — a point Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has made. “The CDC designed a good system.” Fauci said on March 13. “If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector.”
Not the “greatest economy.” On 11 occasions in April, Trump said that the United States had “the greatest economy in the history of the world” before it was shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. On April 10, he also used a variation, “the greatest economy ever created,” and on April 4, he settled for the more modest “greatest economy in the world.” Under Trump, the economy was in good shape, but it has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real annual economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times, including once under President Barack Obama.
Pushing an unproven treatment. On at least five occasions in April, Trump made false and misleading claims about the benefits of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, while downplaying the antimalarial drug’s risks. The president said that hydroxychloroquine is “looking like it’s having some good results,” even after Fauci cautioned that there was only anecdotal evidence. Trump claimed that “there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus,” when in fact there is no such study and lupus patients do contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And he claimed “malaria countries … have very little of this virus,” citing nonexistent “studies.” We found that hydroxychloroquine is not widely used for malaria in much of the world. On April 8, Trump said his administration had purchased “30 million doses” of hydroxychloroquine based on “a lot of good stories” and “some very good results” that the drug worked against COVID-19. But by April 24, the FDA issued a warning against using “hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.”
Strategic National Stockpile wasn’t “empty.” Trump has frequently claimed — falsely — that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies was “empty” or “bare” when he took office. The government does not disclose the exact counts of the stockpile’s contents, but, as of 2016, the year before Trump took office, there were at least six warehouses holding “approximately $7 billion in products across more than 900 separate line items,” according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Posts on Facebook falsely claim to show screenshots of two tweets by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about the U.S. coronavirus response. Schumer didn’t post the supposed tweet criticizing President Donald Trump’s decision to bar travelers from China.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has used Twitter to repeatedly criticize the Trump administration’s response to the spread of the novel coronavirus.
But screenshots circulating on Facebook use a fabricated post alongside one of Schumer’s actual tweets to make the prominent Democrat look as if he contradicted himself.
Schumer did indeed tweet on Feb. 24 that, “We’ve seen no sign that President Trump has any plan or urgency to deal with the spread of the Coronavirus. We need real leadership, and we need it fast.”
But the New York senator didn’t tweet on Feb. 5 about Trump’s “premature travel ban to and from China,” as the doctored post shows. The fake tweet references the Trump administration’s decision on Jan. 31 to bar foreign nationals from entering the country if they visited China in the preceding 14 days (with some exceptions).
The full fabricated tweet reads: “The premature travel ban to and from China by the current administration is just an excuse to further his ongoing war against immigrants. There must be a check and Balance on these restrictions.”
We could find no such tweet by Schumer’s account on his feed. ProPublica’s tool to track deleted tweets from elected officials also shows no such tweet — or any other deleted tweet about the coronavirus — by Schumer. The senator’s spokesman also confirmed to the Associated Press that the tweet was fabricated.
Schumer’s 14 tweets on Feb. 5 focused on the Senate impeachment trial of Trump, which was concluding; Trump’s State of the Union address the night before; a black transgender activist; aid to Puerto Rico; and voting rights.
Some who helped spread the fake tweet later corrected the record. The conservative Power Line blog declared it “a hoax” and apologized to readers.",Angelo Fichera,2020-03-04 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"We need real leadership, and we need it fast.”

31,"No, Clorox and Lysol Didn’t Already ‘Know’ About New Coronavirus",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/no-clorox-and-lysol-didnt-already-know-about-new-coronavirus/,,"In the wake of the expanding outbreak of a new coronavirus from China, people on social media are pointing to disinfecting product labels to falsely suggest that the new virus is not new. 
“So Lysol knew about this new strand of Coronavirus??” asks one Facebook post, which is accompanied by a photo with an arrow pointing to “Human Coronavirus” listed on a bottle of disinfectant spray.
Another Facebook post highlights the words “Human Coronavirus” on a container of Lysol disinfecting wipes, and says, “the label of the popular Lysol already show that the product Kill the Coronavirus, so that means that this Virus is nothing new.”
Other posts make similar claims about Clorox products, with one using the hashtag, #SoStrongItCanKillVirusesOfTheFuture.
These posts are among several instances in which the generic use of the term “coronavirus” has led to confusion, with people on social media erroneously conflating mentions of already known coronavirus strains with the new one.
The word “coronavirus” is not specific, and can apply to any virus in the coronavirus family. The name derives from the crown-like look of the viruses under a microscope.
It turns out that it’s likely these products would be effective against the new virus, which is known as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. But that’s not because either company had any previous knowledge of the virus.
As we have written before, the outbreak began in Wuhan, a city in central China, with the first known cases identified in early December, many of them linked to a seafood market selling a wide selection of game meats and wild animals. 
The Chinese government informed the World Health Organization about the outbreak on Dec. 31, and within a week had ruled out other viruses, including other coronaviruses, and isolated the new virus. Researchers have preliminarily found that 2019-nCoV is about 80% similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, and is 96% similar to a bat virus.
Scientists who have analyzed the viral sequences from infected patients in other countries, too, have found that the sequences are very similar to the first Chinese sequences, corroborating the idea that the virus only recently emerged, and is new to science.
What We Know about the Disinfectants
In terms of the disinfectants, testing is required for manufacturers to make claims about their products. Documents submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency show that Clorox and Lysol sprays and wipes are able to list “Human Coronavirus” on their labels because those products were tested against human coronavirus 229E. 
The 229E strain is a common human coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, that usually causes “mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.” It is not the same as the coronavirus responsible for the current outbreak that began in Wuhan. In fact, it’s in an entirely different genus of coronaviruses.
Although the posts misinterpret the inclusion of “Human Coronavirus” on these labels, the idea that these products might be helpful against the new virus isn’t so off-base. While it’s impossible to know for sure, since none of the products have been tested against 2019-nCoV, the chances are high. For one, these products are considered to be effective against SARS — even if it’s not featured on the label — and the new virus is quite similar.
Even more important, the EPA has a guidance policy that allows companies to claim their products are effective against certain emerging viral pathogens, as long as they can show the products work on other, harder-to-kill viruses. An EPA spokesperson told us in an email that this would not allow a company to put the claim on its label, but would allow companies to add it to technical literature sent to hospitals, as well as to websites, consumer information services and social media sites. 
“The goal of the policy is to allow for rapid response in the event of an emerging viral pathogen outbreak,” the spokesperson added, noting that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is the first time the criteria have been met to trigger the policy.
The policy is based on a classification model of viruses, since different types of viruses are generally harder to kill than others. The easiest viruses to disinfect are the ones with a viral envelope, or membrane, that wraps around the virus. While it sounds protective, these membranes are made up of fatty lipid molecules that are easy to disrupt. As the EPA policy explains, “once the lipid envelope is damaged, the integrity of the virus is compromised, thereby neutralizing its infectivity.” Viruses without envelopes are harder to kill, and those that are small and nonenveloped are harder still.
Fortunately, coronaviruses fall into the enveloped category. Because they do, as long as a product is effective against one nonenveloped virus, then it’s assumed that the product would work against 2019-nCoV, too.
Clorox wipes, for example, work against rotavirus, a large, nonenveloped virus in the Reoviridae family, so the product qualifies as a 2019-nCoV-effective disinfectant. 
Users, however, should note that there are different contact times for different pathogens, and in the case of Clorox wipes, 4 minutes are needed for rotavirus — and therefore also for 2019-nCoV. Common cold coronaviruses, by contrast, require only 15 seconds of contact.
Both Clorox and Lysol have set up FAQ pages about coronavirus, noting that they have tested products against viruses “similar” to 2019-nCoV, and some meet the requirements set out under the EPA policy, and therefore can be used by those concerned about 2019-nCoV.
We reached out to Lysol’s parent company, Reckitt Benckiser, and Clorox but did not receive a reply.
While the risk of 2019-nCoV is low for most Americans, keeping surfaces clean is one of the ways that the CDC recommends people can prevent infection. Other important methods are washing your hands with soap and water — or with a sanitizer if soap is unavailable — as well as avoiding contact with others who are sick.

32,Trump’s COVID-19 Misinformation Since Testing Positive,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trumps-covid-19-misinformation-since-testing-positive/,,"Even after contracting the coronavirus and being hospitalized, President Donald Trump has continued to downplay the risks of COVID-19 and exaggerate the progress the U.S. has made in fighting the pandemic.

Trump told Americans to not let the coronavirus “dominate you,” saying, “You’re going to beat it.” Of course, not everyone has or will survive, and some survivors will have lasting effects. (Read more.)
The president made a flawed comparison between COVID-19 and seasonal flu, incorrectly saying that “sometimes over 100,000” people die from flu each year. The highest estimated death toll from flu in the past decade was in 2017-2018, with 61,000 deaths. (Read more.)
The president talked up the effectiveness of COVID-19 therapeutics and inaccurately attributed some of those successes to his administration. Few options exist for most patients. (Read more.)
After his release from the hospital, Trump claimed to be feeling “better than 20 years ago,” but his own physician cautioned that he might not be “out of the woods” yet. (Read more.)
Saying COVID-19 vaccines “are coming momentarily,” the president once again exaggerated when the public can expect to get a coronavirus shot. (Read more.)

Some Won’t ‘Beat’ COVID-19
After he returned to the White House from Walter Reed hospital on Oct. 5, Trump released a video in which he gave a pep talk of sorts: “I learned so much about coronavirus and one thing that’s for certain: Don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it. You’re going to beat it,” he said.
Of course, not everyone is going to “beat it.” More than 210,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, and more than 1 million worldwide.
It’s true that the overwhelming majority of people who have contracted COVID-19 have survived it. The case fatality rate in the United States is now 2.8% — that’s the percentage of those with confirmed cases who have died. And since not everyone who has been infected has been tested, experts estimate the fatality rate for the coronavirus is likely between 0.5% and 1%.
The chances of “you” beating it are quite good. But there are risk factors that make some individuals more likely to fare well than others.
The older the patient, the greater the risk of hospitalization and death. Figures from the CDC, based on data available through Aug. 18, show that people ages 65 to 74 are five times as likely as 18- to 29-year-olds to be hospitalized and 90 times more likely to die. Those ages 75 to 84 are eight times as likely to be hospitalized and 220 times more likely to die than the young-adult cohort. 
Underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, asthma and chronic kidney disease, increase the risk of hospitalization, the CDC says.
CDC data for the year show that 12.7% of those ages 70-79 who were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 died, and 26.6% of those age 80 and older who were infected died. The dataset has some missing and unknown data on deaths, but from the available information, those fatality rates contrast with just 1.6% for those ages 50-59 and 0.07% for 20- to 29-year-olds who were known to be infected.
Even younger Americans die from the disease, but the rate of death increases with age. For the month of August, there were 5 deaths among those 9 years of age and younger, 16 deaths among 10- to 19-year-olds and 75 deaths among 20- to 29-year-olds. But among those with COVID-19 in the 60-69 age group, 1,890 died in August and 5,638 who were 80 and older died.
The impact of COVID-19 also has been disproportionate based on race and ethnicity. Mortality rates, meaning the deaths per total population not deaths per those infected, are significantly higher among Black Americans (97.9 deaths per 100,000), indigenous Americans (81.9 deaths per 100,000), Pacific Islanders (71.5) and Latinos (64.7) than whites (46.6) and Asians (40.4), according to data compiled by the APM Research Lab through Sept. 15.
Also, among the coronavirus patients who recover, some experience long-term effects and symptoms.
As we’ve written before, these so-called “long-haulers” have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists. Some patients report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches, brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult. They are still trying to “beat” COVID-19.
Influenza
On Oct. 6, the morning after returning to the White House from a three-day stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Trump tweeted about the flu, reviving an old, false claim that the coronavirus is less deadly than seasonal influenza.
“Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,” Trump wrote. “Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!”
Trump exaggerates the death toll from influenza and misleadingly says COVID-19 is “in most populations far less lethal.” That’s likely true for children and some younger people, but not other groups, for whom the risk of death from infection is either similar to flu or significantly higher.
Twitter put a warning on Trump’s tweet for violating its rules on “spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.”
Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that for the past decade, seasonal influenza has claimed between 12,000 and 61,000 lives each year — and on average, fewer than 40,000 lives. 
The worst season in the past 10 years was the 2017-2018 season, which the CDC estimates killed 61,000 people, with a range of 46,000 to 95,000 deaths. Even factoring in the range, however, that season is not thought to have taken more than 100,000 lives.
The CDC’s estimates for earlier seasons also are below Trump’s 100,000 figure. According to a 2010 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, seasonal influenza-associated deaths between 1976 and 2007 ranged from a low of 3,349 in 1986-1987 to 48,614 in 2003-2004.
These figures, importantly, are not reports of individual deaths, which is what we have for COVID-19, but rather are estimates based on mathematical modeling. For this reason, they cannot be directly compared with the COVID-19 death toll, which at exceeds 210,000 in the U.S. as of Oct. 6 and is almost certainly an undercount.
In any case, even using that figure, COVID-19 has killed more people in the U.S. than the past five flu seasons combined. A preliminary estimate for the 2019-2020 season, which overlapped to a small degree with COVID-19 this spring, estimates flu deaths at 22,000 — about 10 times lower than the number of COVID-19 deaths so far this year.
Another sign that COVID-19 has caused unprecedented mortality is the large number of excess deaths since the virus arrived in America. The CDC’s latest estimate is that between Feb. 1 and Sept. 19, there have been between 214,865 and 285,404 more deaths in the U.S. than usual, with a middle estimate of just over 250,000 excess deaths. While not all of these deaths are due to COVID-19, some fraction of them are.
Trump’s claim that COVID-19 is “in most populations far less lethal” than the flu is misleading. 
Experts say that overall, COVID-19 is more deadly than seasonal flu, for which the mortality rate is “usually well below 0.1%,” according to the World Health Organization. 
As we’ve discussed before, the true infection fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, for COVID-19 isn’t entirely clear, but the WHO estimates it to be between 0.5% and 1%.
It is true that flu is likely more risky for most children than COVID-19.
The CDC’s website says the “risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,” although it notes that infants and kids with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both viral infections — and that school-aged children infected with COVID-19 are at higher risk of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, “a rare but severe complication of COVID-19.”
The CDC also provides its own estimate of the infection fatality rate by age, but it is based on a single paper covering six European regions — and is not meant to be an estimate of the impact of COVID-19. 
According to the agency, the infection fatality rate is very low for kids 19 years old and younger — at 0.003% — and quite low for adults ages 20 to 49, at 0.02%. But for people ages 50 to 69, the infection fatality rate is significantly higher, at 0.5%, and a whopping 5.4% above the age of 70.
Around 117 million people in the U.S. are 50 or older, accounting for more than a third of the country. Many people of all ages also have one or more risk factors for COVID-19, which would alter their individual risk.
Regardless, experts say the infection fatality rate is not the only measure that matters when it comes to knowing how dangerous a virus can be to a population.
Unlike seasonal influenza, for which there are approved drugs and a vaccine, there are only a limited number of therapies for COVID-19. And much of the population has some immunity to flu viruses each year, since they circulate seasonally, coming back in modified, but not entirely new forms. That’s not the case for SARS-CoV-2, which is a new pandemic virus, so many more people are susceptible.
The coronavirus is also thought to spread more easily than seasonal flu and poses particular challenges as more cases are linked to superspreading events.
“While COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups than flu,” the CDC explains on its website. “Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have more superspreading events than flu. This means the virus that causes COVID-19 can quickly and easily spread to a lot of people and result in continuous spreading among people as time progresses.”
Thus, even if younger people are less at risk from the coronavirus than flu, if they spread it to older people, as the CDC has suggested has happened, the damage can be significant.
As Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us previously, “I’m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.”
The data to date show there’s no contest between COVID-19 and seasonal influenza — the coronavirus has killed far more people and the pandemic is still ongoing.
COVID-19 Therapies
In tweets and video appearances during his convalescence, Trump repeatedly boasted about available COVID-19 therapeutics, taking undue credit for the developments and exaggerating the degree to which they are known to be effective.
In an Oct. 3 video filmed at Walter Reed — a day into Trump’s hospital stay — the president likened the therapeutics to miracles.
“If you look at the therapeutics, which I’m taking right now, some of them, and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they’re miracles, if you want to know the truth, they’re miracles,” he said. “People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they’re miracles, coming down from God.”
Two days later, Trump echoed the claim, but also took credit for the drug developments.
“We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge,” Trump said in an Oct. 5 tweet announcing his departure later that day from the hospital.
And in an Oct. 5 video released after Trump’s return to the White House, he once again returned to the subject. “We have the best medical equipment. We have the best medicines, all developed recently, and you’re going to beat it,” he said, after advising the public not to be afraid of the coronavirus.
In reality, as we’ve explained, there remain few treatment options for COVID-19, with the mainstay primarily being supportive care. And of the few drugs that do exist, some are either not yet widely available to the public, have yet to demonstrate a mortality benefit or were not investigated in the U.S. 
The FDA has not approved any drugs for COVID-19, but has issued a few emergency use authorizations, or EUAs.
According to his physicians, Trump received at least three drugs: an investigational antibody cocktail normally unavailable outside of a clinical trial, the antiviral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.
Dexamethasone is the only drug that has been shown to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients survive in a clinical trial, but its use is relatively limited. It is recommended only for patients on a ventilator or receiving supplemental oxygen, as it may harm other patients. It is also hardly a cure, as it reduced death by 18% in patients receiving oxygen and 36% in those who were ventilated.
The drug was developed in the U.S., but more than a half century ago. The randomized controlled trial establishing its utility in COVID-19 patients was conducted in the U.K.
Remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time to recovery for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but whether it provides a mortality benefit is still unknown. The FDA is permitting its use under an EUA that is restricted to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
While the trials demonstrating an effect in COVID-19 patients were done during the Trump administration, getting the drug to that point goes back more than a decade. Remdesivir was famously tested against the Ebola virus in 2014 and then was tested against other coronaviruses, including the SARS and MERS viruses, setting it up nicely as a candidate that might work against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
Trump’s third drug, an antibody cocktail targeting the coronavirus made by the biotech company Regeneron, is widely viewed as a promising potential therapy. But there is no proof yet that the therapy is effective, and it’s not yet available to the vast majority of the country.
On Sept. 29, the company announced preliminary results from its first 275 patients, saying in a press release that its antibody cocktail reduced viral levels and reduced symptoms among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Other companies are working on developing similar antibodies, and Eli Lily issued similar interim results via press release.
Trump received Regeneron’s product, which is still in testing and has not received an EUA from the FDA, through a compassionate use request. Normally, the only way to receive such a medicine would be to participate in a clinical trial.
The company explained in a statement that its focus was on maintaining enough supply of its cocktail for trials, and said there “is limited product available for compassionate use requests that have been approved under rare, exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case basis.”
Even if the antibodies do pan out in trials and are approved, there is concern that their supplies will be limited because making the proteins is a complex and expensive process.
Trump’s Health
In urging the public not to let COVID-19 “dominate your life,” the president boasted on Twitter and in a video that he is feeling “better than 20 years ago.”
But the president may not be — in the words of his doctor — “out of the woods” yet.
In confirming that Trump would be released from the hospital, Dr. Sean P. Conley, the president’s physician, said: “Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations — and most importantly his clinical status — support the president’s safe return home, where he’ll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7.”
There is no question that the president’s condition has improved. Trump initially had a fever, a mild cough, fatigue and at least two brief drops in his oxygen saturation level, according to his doctors. But, as of Oct. 5, the president had been fever-free in the last 72 hours, hasn’t required any additional oxygen and hasn’t complained of shortness of breath, his doctors said.
As for his vital organs, the president’s “cardiac, liver and kidney function demonstrates continued normal findings or improving findings,” Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, said on Oct. 4.
However, the president’s doctors have repeatedly declined to answer questions about Trump’s lung function.
On Oct. 4, Conley was vague when asked about signs of pneumonia or lung damage, saying there had been “some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern.” On Oct. 5, he declined again to reveal the results of X-rays or CT scans, citing a federal law that prevents a doctor from discussing a patient’s health without the patient’s consent. 
Trump remains at risk for developing a more severe case of COVID-19. 
Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta, told the New York Times in April that some patients experience “a very nasty second wave” of the illness between five to 10 days after experiencing symptoms. “After the initial symptoms, things plateau and maybe even improve a little bit, and then there is a secondary worsening,” Schwartz said.
That is especially for older people with underlying health conditions. At 74 years old, Trump is at higher risk than younger people for contracting a serious case of COVID-19, and males have consistently had worse outcomes, on average, than females. He is also slightly obese, with a body mass index of 30.5 (30 is considered obese) — another risk factor. 
When confirming Trump’s release from the hospital, Conley said Trump is still within that 10-day window and won’t take “that final deep sigh of relief” until next week.
Reporter, Oct. 5: You had said that seven to 10 days was a window that you’d be concerned about. I don’t think we’re there yet. So, do you have concerns about potential worsening or reversal? And what are your plans for addressing that if it were to happen?
Conley: You’re absolutely right. And that’s why we all remain cautiously optimistic and on guard because we’re in a bit of unchartered territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course. So, we’re looking to this weekend. If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief.
Vaccines ‘Coming Momentarily’?
In his video after being released from the hospital, Trump said that “the vaccines are coming momentarily.” It is not clear yet when vaccines will be available, but even in a best-case scenario it won’t be “momentarily” for the general population.
As we have written before, there are four companies running phase 3 trials of a coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. A successful phase 3 trial is the final step needed for approval. Assuming the trials go well and the shots are found to be safe and effective, one or more vaccines may be available by the end of the year or by early 2021 to select groups, such as health care workers and adults with underlying conditions. 
Members of the general population who are not prioritized for vaccination, however, are not expected to be able to receive a vaccine until later in 2021. 
According to guidance the FDA released on Oct. 6, the agency is looking for phase 3 trial data that include “a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen.”

That timeline makes it very unlikely that any vaccine would receive authorization prior to Nov. 3, Election Day.

According to a list maintained by The Chronicle of Higher Education, more than 200 colleges and universities are “requiring [COVID-19] vaccines of at least some students or employees” ahead of the fall semester.
Other employers are requiring — or at least considering a requirement — that their workers be vaccinated against the disease, as well.
Is that legal? 
There is no federal law that says vaccines cannot be required for employees or students. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: “Whether an employer may require or mandate COVID-19 vaccination is a matter of state or other applicable law.”
In updated guidance issued in December, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission implied that employers can have a mandatory vaccination policy, including for COVID-19, as long as employers comply with federal laws stipulating that reasonable accommodations should be made for workers who cannot be immunized because of a disability or religious reason.
Employers also may be subject to collective bargaining agreements that require them to negotiate with employee unions before mandating vaccines as a condition of employment, as the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has noted.
But some employers — particularly in the health care industry — already have a history of requiring certain vaccinations, such as for influenza, for their workers.
In addition, a 2017 survey of 129 of the top U.S. colleges and universities found that 94% of them had at least one prematriculation immunization requirement for students. The average was 3.53 required immunizations, for diseases such as hepatitis B and measles.
However, there remains some uncertainty about the legality of institutions mandating vaccinations using products that have not been fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Emergency Use Authorization vs. Full Approval
As we have explained, the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have all received an emergency use authorization, or EUA, rather than the standard full licensure, which is called a biologics license application, or BLA. 
On May 7, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they have initiated the final BLA approval process for their jointly-produced vaccine. But Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — the makers of the other two authorized vaccines — still have not said when they will do the same.
Update, Aug. 27: The FDA approved the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. Moderna began submitting data for its BLA application on June 1 and completed its submission on Aug. 25.
Typically, the standards are less stringent for EUAs. Under an EUA, regulators must determine that the product “may be effective” and the “known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.” However, for the three COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA set up special, more rigorous EUA requirements that resemble the process for a BLA. The FDA required “at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner” and wanted to see at least two months of follow-up data on half or more of the participants. 
But to some legal observers, the current authorization status of the vaccines means they cannot yet be required by employers and others. 
In a Feb. 16 post for the Health Affairs blog, Efthimios Parasidis, a professor of law and public health at the Ohio State University, and Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, concluded that, “Although EUAs for Covid-19 vaccines may help society overcome the wrath of the pandemic, mandates for such vaccines are unlikely to pass legal muster.” 
They pointed to a provision in the 2004 federal law that established EUAs — specifically the provision that requires informational disclosures for individuals offered a medical product authorized for emergency use.
“Specifically, under 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III), each individual must be informed ‘of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks,'” Parasidis and Kesselheim wrote. 
“Although no court has interpreted this provision, the first segment of the subclause suggests that mandates are categorically prohibited, since each person must have ‘the option to accept or refuse.'”
Other law and health policy experts disagree.
“There are few to no legal barriers to employers or schools requiring vaccines being distributed under EUAs,” according to an April 5 opinion piece written by three legal experts for the health news website STAT. The coauthors were Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of Law; and I. Glenn Cohen and Carmel Shachar of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School.
They counter argued that the EUA statute actually applies to the actions of federal officials — such as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services — not private actors, including employers and post-secondary schools. 
“Private employees are generally ‘at will,’ meaning they can be terminated for any reason that is not explicitly illegal,” the authors wrote. “Those arguing that the EUA statute prohibits mandates by at-will employers are claiming that this federal law is changing existing state employment law on the topic by mere implication. They are reading in a broad prohibition covering all employers and universities in the U.S. that is not, in fact, in the statute. Such broad preemption would require, at a minimum, clearer language.”
Also, because individuals must be given information about “the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product,” that “clearly” means “consequences for refusal can coexist with the option to refuse,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a presidential assistant professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, and Govind Persad, an assistant professor of law at the University of Denver.
“The FDA doesn’t specify what those consequences might be, but it also doesn’t limit them,” they wrote in a May 4 opinion piece for the Washington Post. “If Congress or the FDA had meant to remove the authority to mandate vaccines — an authority traditionally left to state and local governments — the emergency use authorization statute and guidance would have needed to be much clearer on that point.”
Fernandez Lynch and Persad suggested the consequences for refusing vaccination could include “job loss, fines, one more year of Zoom college, or exclusion from flights, concerts or bars.” All may be unpopular options, but “these are choices nonetheless,” they said.
In their opinion piece, however, Parasidis and Kesselheim asserted that the statute’s language on the consequences of refusing to be vaccinated is most plausibly a reference to only the “health risks of refusing an EUA product during a public health emergency,” such as an increased risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
“A review of the Congressional Record reveals no mention of allowing the government or private entities the ability to mandate administration of EUA products,” the professors wrote.
But absent any state or local laws specifically permitting or prohibiting mandates for EUA vaccines, determining the legality of such requirements will likely come down to future court decisions.
Currently, there are at least two pending federal lawsuits that will test the issue: one filed by a county corrections officer in New Mexico, and another filed by a group of Los Angeles public school workers. The plaintiffs in both cases argue that their government employers are illegally mandating EUA vaccines as a condition of employment.
Legal analysts expect that there will be more lawsuits, including against private employers and colleges and universities.
Update, July 20: On July 18, a federal judge upheld Indiana University’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement, denying the student plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction to block the policy. The plaintiffs had cited their constitutional right to due process under the 14th Amendment. In a 101-page ruling, Judge Damon R. Leichty of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana wrote that “the Fourteenth Amendment permits Indiana University to pursue a reasonable and due process of vaccination in the legitimate interest of public health for its students, faculty, and staff.”   
“Indiana University insisting on vaccinations for its campus communities is rationally related to ensuring the public health of students, faculty, and staff this fall,” wrote Leichty, who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. “Stemming illness, hospitalizations, or deaths at the university level hardly proves irrational.”
Update, Aug. 13: On Aug. 12, Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected the student plaintiffs’ challenge to Indiana University’s vaccine mandate. Barrett denied the request for an injunction without comment and without referring the matter to the full court.  
Update, Oct. 14: On Sept. 9, President Joe Biden directed the Labor Department to develop a temporary emergency rule for businesses with 100 or more employees that would require workers to be fully vaccinated or be tested at least once a week. The White House believes Biden has the authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which says the secretary of labor can issue “an emergency temporary standard,” or ETS, if “employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards” and “that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.” For more about the proposal, see “Q&A on Biden’s COVID-19 Vaccine-or-Test Rule.”

34,Trump’s Mysterious Claim of an Apology ‘Letter’ from Biden,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trumps-mysterious-claim-of-an-apology-letter-from-biden/,,"President Donald Trump has claimed Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, wrote him a “letter of apology” regarding the administration’s travel restrictions on China. But there’s no evidence of such a letter, and Biden’s campaign says it “never happened.”
We asked the White House about the president’s claim, and we haven’t received a response.
It’s possible Trump has added an extra layer of exaggeration on a prior claim that Biden had “apologized” for criticizing the travel restrictions, a claim Trump made on April 28. But Biden didn’t “apologize” for any criticism. His campaign on April 3 said Biden supported the administration’s travel restrictions on China, and it argued that Biden’s earlier comments about Trump’s “record of hysteria and xenophobia” weren’t a reference to the restrictions, though they were made the same day those travel prohibitions were announced.
On Jan. 31, a day after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the U.S. and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. It didn’t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family.  
Also on Jan. 31, Biden, speaking at a campaign event in Iowa about the coronavirus outbreak, said that Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.” He added, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.”
He reiterated those comments the next day on Twitter, saying: “We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.”
Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden called him “xenophobic” and “racist” because of the travel restrictions on China. But Biden didn’t say he was talking about those restrictions.
On April 3, the former vice president’s campaign said Biden supported the Trump administration’s travel restrictions on China, and it said Biden’s “reference to xenophobia” wasn’t about the travel restrictions but rather “Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.”
“Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. “Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.”
The next day, on April 4, Trump said there had been “breaking news last night” that Biden “agreed that [Trump] was correct when I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country.”
But Biden the following day criticized Trump for a “slow” response to the crisis, saying on ABC’s “This Week”: “You got to go faster than slower. And we started off awfully slow. He indicated that I complimented him on — on dealing with China. Well, you know, 45 nations had already moved to keep — block China’s personnel from being able to come to the United States before the president moved. So, it’s just — it’s about pace. It’s about — it’s about the urgency. And I don’t think there’s been enough of it, urgency.”
As we’ve explained before, both politicians have spun the facts on whether Trump’s travel restrictions were “very, very early,” as Trump claims, or after “45 nations had already moved,” as Biden said. Data from Think Global Health, a project by the Council on Foreign Relations tracking countries’ travel restrictions, show “that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,” a co-author of the tracker, Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development, told us. 
In late April, Trump claimed that Biden had “apologized,” and in a May 3 Fox News virtual town hall, the president twice said Biden made that apology in a letter.
Trump, Fox News virtual town hall, May 3: They called me a racist. They said “xenophobic.” Biden said, “He was xenophobic.” Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. …
And he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying, “He made the right move.” It wasn’t well played by the press, but he said I made the right move.
We found no evidence of an apology letter. Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told us in an email: “Never happened.”
As for Trump’s claim about saving “hundreds of thousands of lives,” we found no support for such a figure, either. As we’ve written, the few studies that have been done on travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China estimate those measures had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump also referred to “a letter of apology” a few weeks prior, in an April 13 coronavirus task force briefing, during a back-and-forth with a reporter over what the administration had done regarding the coronavirus pandemic in February. Trump cited his travel restrictions on China and said of Biden, “Why did he write a letter of apology?” The reporter, CBS News’ Paula Reid, replied, “I don’t think the unemployed people right now care about why Joe Biden didn’t apologize to you, sir.”
In fact, Biden didn’t apologize — his campaign instead said he supported the president’s China travel restrictions.

35,RFK Jr. Video Pushes Known Vaccine Misrepresentations,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-rfk-jr-video-pushes-known-vaccine-misrepresentations/,,"Several vaccine falsehoods and misrepresentations have been strung together in a video aimed at discouraging Black people from getting vaccinated against COVID-19.
The hourlong video, called “Medical Racism: The New Apartheid,” is hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, Children’s Health Defense. It includes mostly rehashed claims about vaccine safety framed to exploit distrust of the medical establishment in Black communities.
The video, which was made available on March 11, doesn’t offer any evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful. Instead, it relies on innuendo — citing historical examples of ethical failures in medicine, misrepresenting various scientific studies, and suggesting that the medical establishment can’t be trusted.
For example, Kennedy — who is a lawyer, not a doctor — ends the video by discouraging viewers from following the advice of public health officials, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Don’t listen to me, don’t listen to Tony Fauci, and don’t listen to your doctor,” Kennedy says before advising viewers to review the package inserts for vaccines and question whether the ingredients are safe. (See SciCheck’s articles on each vaccine: “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
Likewise, promotional material for the video baselessly claims that “[t]here are signs that history is repeating itself with the coronavirus” and questions, “Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?”

This is similar to the approach taken in another disinformation video we recently wrote about. In both cases, the videos acknowledge that Black people in the U.S. are suffering higher rates of illness and death from COVID-19, while simultaneously casting doubt on the vaccines that could curb the virus.
Referring to Kennedy, Dr. Richard Allen Williams, founder and president of the nonprofit Minority Health Institute, told us in a phone interview: “It seems what he does is take old information and make a … leap to the present time and say what happened then is what is applicable to what is going on now.”
But historical examples of unethical medical conduct are very different from the authorized COVID-19 vaccines.
All three available vaccines in the U.S. went through clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants before the Food and Drug Administration granted them each an emergency use authorization. About 10% of participants in those trials were Black for two of the vaccines and about 17% were Black for the third. The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed by the FDA and an outside panel of experts. These tested, authorized vaccines are now available to the general population.
Still, disinformation about the vaccines persists.
For example, Williams — also a clinical professor of medicine at the UCLA School of Medicine — noted that when baseball legend and civil rights activist Henry “Hank” Aaron died of natural causes on Jan. 22, more than two weeks after he received a COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy “seemed to make an association between Hank’s death and his previous vaccination.” We wrote about the misleading comments made by Kennedy and his group at the time.
 “That’s an example of the dangerous thing he does,” Williams said, referring to the “harmful effects of influencing people to not take the vaccine.”
We’ll address a few misleading claims used to promote the video and aimed at undermining vaccines.
Rehashed Claim About CDC Study, Autism
The video misrepresents a 2004 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that did not find an association between autism and measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.
The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at the age of children living in the Atlanta area when they received their first MMR vaccine and whether there was a correlation between the timing of the vaccine and a diagnosis of autism. If vaccines were contributing to autism, then one might expect to see more autism cases in kids who received the vaccine earlier, as we wrote about a similar claim.
The study did not find that vaccines were causing autism.
But Kennedy’s organization falsely claims that the “study discovered that African-American boys who receive the MMR vaccine ‘on-time’ by the age of 3 are 3.36 times more likely to be diagnosed with severe autism as Black boys who waited until they were older.”
That’s not what the study found. That’s what a purported reanalysis of the data claimed to find a decade later.
Brian Hooker — who has a degree in chemical engineering, not medicine, and has contributed articles to the Children’s Health Defense website — wrote the reanalysis for the journal Translational Neurodegeneration. But the paper was retracted just over a month after it was published.
It’s worth noting, too, that his research was funded by Focus Autism, an anti-vaccine group now known as Focus for Health, where Hooker reportedly served on the board.
Also, Hooker had filed a claim under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program alleging that his son’s autism was caused by vaccines. The lawsuit was pending at the time Hooker published the paper, but was later dismissed in a 58-page opinion in which the judge said, “[T]his case is not a close call.” The judge found no connection between vaccines and the boy’s disorder.
The paper was retracted because “there were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author” and there were also “concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis.”
Prior to publishing his paper, Hooker had spoken to Dr. William Thompson, one of the researchers on the original CDC study. Thompson had shared his concerns about the study’s process, but later explained that he did not know Hooker had been recording their conversations and had no control over how Hooker used the recordings.
Thompson still works at the CDC, and when we reached him by phone, he referred us to his lawyer, Rick Morgan. Neither would speak to us on the record, but Morgan provided us with Thompson’s 2014 statement. It said, in part: “I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits.”
So, the claim in the video uses a discredited paper to misrepresent the findings of a CDC study.
Misrepresented Mayo Clinic Study
In another distortion of scientific research, the video twists the meaning of a preliminary 2014 study that found some Somali Americans developed twice the antibody response to rubella after getting the vaccine compared with Caucasians.
The Children’s Health Defense material, however, claims that the study, which was done by Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, “means that African-American children are being ‘overdosed’ with today’s current vaccine concentration.”
But that’s not at all what the study found, Poland told us in a phone interview.
He explained that this claim is based on a hypothesis generating study, which means that researchers look at a small sample, make observations and speculate about what those observations could mean. Then they do a larger study.
In this case, Poland said, “We haven’t done the larger study.”
In 2014, Poland and a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic looked at 1,100 healthy children and young adults in Rochester, Minnesota, and more than 1,000 participants from the U.S. Naval Health Research Center in San Diego as the control group, as well as a group of recent immigrants to Rochester from Somalia.
As we said, the Somali Americans developed twice the antibodies to rubella after getting the vaccine as their white counterparts.
Since they haven’t done the larger study, researchers don’t know why there is a difference or what it might mean. It could mean that white children are being underdosed, Poland said, explaining that without further study it’s unclear.
What is clear is that the claim from the Children’s Health Defense is wrong. “We do not have a study that shows African Americans need half the dose. We do not have a study that shows African American children are being overdosed,” Poland said.
He described the claim as being “like a good conspiracy theory — it contains a grain of truth with a lot of speculations around it.”
The grain of truth is that researchers found higher levels of antibodies in Somali immigrants, but the rest is conjecture. The higher levels may not have anything to do with the vaccine, Poland said. For example, the study subjects could have been exposed to rubella in refugee camps before arriving in the U.S., so the antibodies from the vaccine would have added to what was already in their systems.
So, again, this claim is a misrepresentation of a preliminary study.
Understanding Flawed Measles Vaccines Trial
The video also revisits a controversial clinical trial from 30 years ago. Several years after the study concluded, the CDC acknowledged it had failed to notify parents that one of the vaccines used in the study was experimental, and of the specific risks involved. 
“The Tuskegee experiment that took place from 1932 to 1972 — the CDC promised us that an experiment like this would never happen again, but yet in 1989 there was a Los Angeles Times article that came out that revealed the startling truth: that the CDC admitted that they experimented on 1,500 Black and Latino boys in Los Angeles — without the parents knowing that this was an experimental test,” Tony Muhammad, of the Nation of Islam, says in the video.
That’s referring to a clinical trial for measles vaccines that the CDC conducted in Los Angeles on babies up to a year old between 1990 and 1991 — amid a measles epidemic that began in 1989.
The CDC acknowledged in a 1996 Los Angeles Times story that the families involved in the Los Angeles trial were not informed that one of the vaccines used in the trial was experimental. The majority of the children were African American and Latino, the newspaper reported.
The study involved about 1,500 children, who received either high or standard doses of the Edmonston-Zagreb, or EZ, vaccine or standard doses of the Moraten vaccine, according to testimony to Congress in May 1997 by then-CDC Director Dr. David Satcher. The Moraten vaccine was already licensed for use in the U.S. during the trial. But while other countries widely used standard doses of the EZ vaccine at the time, it was new to the U.S., and the high-dose version was experimental.
The CDC stopped the trial in October 1991 after separate studies in Senegal and Haiti suggested baby girls vaccinated with the higher potency version were at increased risk of dying in the two to three years following vaccination.
Satcher, who was not director when the trial took place, said in his prepared remarks that the EZ vaccines that were used in the trial were approved for investigation by the Food and Drug Administration but that the consent form for families was “deficient.”
He said a subsequent review by the Office for Protection from Research Risks (now the Office for Human Research Protections in the Department of Health and Human Services) determined the study was “scientifically and ethically justified,” but the consent form failed to identify “the EZ vaccine as experimental” and failed to provide an “adequate description of the foreseeable risks of the experimental EZ vaccine.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, “the form did not say that E-Z was experimental or unlicensed. But a brochure that accompanied the form said: ‘This vaccine has been shown to be effective in younger children. Over 200 million children around the world have received this vaccine, but Los Angeles County is the first place in the United States where it is being offered.'”
Satcher said in a follow-up effort with families, “parents were informed of the reason for the follow-up study, including the fact that some studies had found lower survival in those children who received high potency vaccine.”
The CDC didn’t find any ill effects associated with the high potency EZ vaccine in its study. It did not identify any children who took part in the Los Angeles study and received the high potency EZ vaccine who “suffered a significant health problem that can be associated with the vaccine,” Satcher said.
One child died about a year after receiving a standard-dose EZ vaccine, according to Satcher, and “experts reviewed the death certificate, the circumstances surrounding the death, and the autopsy report and all agreed with the conclusion that the death was in all likelihood unrelated to the vaccine.”
Williams, of the Minority Health Institute, told us that the mistakes made were legitimate issues that shouldn’t be forgotten. But the effort to compare that situation to the COVID-19 vaccine was “a matter of apples and oranges,” he said.
“It’s not logical to take the results of what happened in an entirely different context and apply it to our current situation,” added Williams, a past president of the National Medical Association, which is the largest and oldest association of Black physicians.
It’s worth emphasizing, as we said earlier, that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. have successfully undergone clinical trials that demonstrated their safety.
Williams said that he believes the issues with the measles vaccines trial weren’t given sufficient attention at the time. But, he said, that doesn’t substantiate suggestions that the same thing is happening now.
“It needs to be understood, there was a mistake made,” Williams said, in order to make sure “those kinds of mistakes are not being made” again. “In fact, there are all sorts of preventive measures” to ensure that kind of mistake doesn’t occur, he added.
Satcher outlined some changes that were made following the trial during his 1997 testimony, including institutional review changes and the creation of a checklist of elements that are to be included on consent forms.
Revisiting the Impact of Vitamin D
The video also revisits the topic of vitamin D and COVID-19. It presents a clip of Fauci speaking in an Instagram interview, telling the actress Jennifer Garner: “If you are deficient in vitamin D that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection — so I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.”
Fauci was speaking (at about 31:30) about infections in general, however — not the novel coronavirus specifically, as the video may imply.
“My question is, why isn’t this being discussed, or why isn’t the CDC or the World Health Organization jumping on this as a potential solution to do more research around it?” Dr. Charles Penick, a family medicine physician, asks in the video.
It’s worth noting that there are many studies under way looking into the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19.
As we’ve explained before, while vitamin D might be helpful in terms of COVID-19, there isn’t enough scientific evidence yet to know whether it can treat or prevent the disease. That said, health experts do advise getting enough vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle, regardless. Most of a person’s vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight.
One study published in October in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, which evaluated the vitamin D levels of 216 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, found that the hospitalized patients had lower levels of vitamin D compared with a group in the general population — although it didn’t identify a relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe disease among those patients.

While suggestive, the study doesn’t prove that vitamin D was a factor in whether those patients fell ill or that taking vitamin D supplements would have helped, as it was not a randomized controlled trial.
Two other recent studies — which have not yet been peer-reviewed — appear to cast doubt on the effectiveness of vitamin D in preventing COVID-19.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-03-11 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"(See SciCheck’s articles on each vaccine: “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
Likewise, promotional material for the video baselessly claims that “[t here are signs that history is repeating itself with the coronavirus” and questions, “Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?”

This is similar to the approach taken in another disinformation video we recently wrote about. The Children’s Health Defense material, however, claims that the study, which was done by Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, “means that African-American children are being ‘overdosed’ with today’s current vaccine concentration.”
But that’s not at all what the study found, Poland told us in a phone interview. One child died about a year after receiving a standard-dose EZ vaccine, according to Satcher, and “experts reviewed the death certificate, the circumstances surrounding the death, and the autopsy report and all agreed with the conclusion that the death was in all likelihood unrelated to the vaccine.”

In 2014, Poland and a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic looked at 1,100 healthy children and young adults in Rochester, Minnesota, and more than 1,000 participants from the U.S."
36,Correcting Trump’s Press Conference Misinformation,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/correcting-trumps-press-conference-misinformation/,,"President Donald Trump has been holding daily press conferences to provide the latest information about the coronavirus from the federal government, but his rhetoric has sometimes been imprecise, misleading or outright incorrect.
Here are three recent examples:

News reports suggest China may have known about and concealed emerging information in the weeks after the novel coronavirus was detected, but Trump exaggerated how long when he said, “I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.”
Trump said, “We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers.” He didn’t mention that nearly half the nation’s workforce — those who work for companies employing 500 or more people — isn’t covered by the bill.
He also said, “I don’t think I’ve ever said, ‘No,'” to providing funds for other countries to fight diseases. But Trump has proposed global health budget cuts, including for programs that aim to prevent or respond to infectious diseases worldwide.

These statements were made in press conferences on March 20, 21 and 22.
How Long Did China Conceal News?
News reports suggest China may have known about and concealed emerging information in the weeks after the novel coronavirus was detected. But Trump went too far when he said, “I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.”
The symptoms from the first cases of the virus did not emerge until early December, at the earliest, and China alerted the World Health Organization of mysterious pneumonia cases on Dec. 31. By early January, at the latest, the U.S. government was aware of the virus.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Trump’s right-hand man during the coronavirus crisis, said the president’s statement “doesn’t comport [with the facts], because 2 or 3 months earlier would have been September.”
But the president has since repeated the claim.
In a press conference on March 21, Trump was asked when he first learned that the new coronavirus was going to be a problem. Trump said it was right around the time he imposed travel restrictions on China, which were announced on Jan. 31 and went into effect two days later.
Trump, March 21: Well, you know, when I learned, I started doing the closings. So, you know, probably around that time. We didn’t learn much. I think you’re going to ask a little bit about China responsibility. I do think that — again, I have great respect for China. I like China. I think the people of China are incredible. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi.
I wish they could have told us earlier about what was going on inside. We didn’t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could have told us earlier about it because we could have come up with a solution.
Tony Fauci and all of the people — the talent that we have — would have loved to have had three or four months of additional time, if you knew that this was going to be happening. They didn’t have that time. They read about in the newspapers like everybody else. China was very secretive, okay? Very, very secretive. And that’s unfortunate. …
But I wish they were able to — I wish they would have told us earlier, Steve, that they were having a problem. Because they were having a big problem and they knew it, and I wish they could have given us an advanced warning. Because we could have done — we could have had a lot of things — as an example, some of the things that we’re talking about, where we order them as quickly as we can. If we had a two- or three-month difference in time, it would have been much better.
In an interview with Science magazine the following morning, Fauci said he told “the appropriate people” on the White House staff that Trump’s “three to four month” timeline was off.
Jon Cohen, Science magazine, March 22: What about the travel restrictions? Trump keeps saying that the travel ban for China, which began 2 February, had a big impact on slowing the spread of the virus to the United States and that he wishes China would have told us 3 to 4 months earlier and that they were “very secretive.” [China did not immediately reveal the discovery of a new coronavirus in late December 2019, but by 10 January, Chinese researchers made the sequence of the virus public.] It just doesn’t comport with facts.
Fauci: I know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let’s get real, what do you want me to do?
Cohen: Most everyone thinks that you’re doing a remarkable job, but you’re standing there as the representative of truth and facts, but things are being said that aren’t true and aren’t factual.
Fauci: The way it happened is that after he made that statement [suggesting China could have revealed the discovery of a new coronavirus 3 to 4 months earlier], I told the appropriate people, it doesn’t comport, because 2 or 3 months earlier would have been September. The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he’s going to say, they will say, ‘By the way, Mr. President, be careful about this and don’t say that.’ But I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down. OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.
It didn’t get corrected the next time.
In a press conference later that day, Trump repeated the claim, saying, “I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem.”
Trump, March 22:  I wish — again, our relationship with China is a very good relationship. I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem. We didn’t know about it. They knew about it and they should have told us. We could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. If you look at what’s happening in Italy and Spain and a lot of other countries, we could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world.
So when did China know about the virus, and when did the U.S. find out? The answer to both questions is difficult to pinpoint. But let’s start with China.
According to the World Health Organization, symptoms from the first cluster of confirmed cases emerged between Dec. 8 and Jan. 2. A study on the novel coronavirus published in The Lancet reported, “The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019.”
On Dec. 31, the Chinese informed the World Health Organization’s China office “of a pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market.”
The WHO says it then “began monitoring the situation and requested further information on the laboratory tests performed and the different diagnoses considered.”
On Feb. 1, the Washington Post, citing “official statements, leaked accounts from Chinese medical professionals, newly released scientific data and interviews with public health officials and infectious disease experts,” documented efforts by the Chinese government to tamp down information about the virus “during the critical period from mid-December to mid-January.”
According to the Post, “Medical professionals who tried to sound an alarm were seized by police. Key state media omitted mention of the outbreak for weeks. ”
By Jan. 11, the Chinese had shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, which could then be used by other countries to develop diagnostic kits. Still, the Washington Post reported, “Key information about who got sick and when was not released publicly until weeks later, scientists and researchers said.”
Trump said he didn’t learn that the virus would be a problem until “probably around” the time when he imposed travel restrictions on China. Those were announced on Jan. 31. But the government had growing concerns about the virus weeks before that.
In a press conference on March 20, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the U.S. was alerted to the problems in China “by some discussions that Dr. [Robert] Redfield, the director of the CDC, had with Chinese colleagues on January 3rd. It’s since been known that there may have been cases in December, not that we were alerted in December.”
According to the Washington Post, “U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus while President Trump and lawmakers played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting.” Those agencies warned that “Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.”
The WHO confirmed the first case outside of China on Jan. 13 in Thailand and confirmed three days later that the virus had spread to Japan. At around that time, the WHO warned that there could be a wider outbreak and recommended “all countries to continue preparedness activities.”
In a CNBC interview on Jan. 22, Trump said of the virus, “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”
On Jan. 24, Trump tweeted, “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!“
On Jan. 30, the WHO declared a global public health emergency, and Trump imposed travel restrictions a day later.
But even into late February, Trump continued to downplay the potential spread of the virus.
“So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck,” Trump said at a White House briefing on Feb. 26. “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”
Asked about his Jan. 24 tweet praising China for its “efforts and transparency,” Trump on March 21 said his comments about China’s efforts were true.
“China has worked very hard,” Trump said, but he added that “they weren’t transparent.”
“They were transparent at that time, but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were,” Trump said. “I just wish they could have told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could have said that.”
Trump has a point about Chinese officials not being transparent with information about the new coronavirus. But suggesting China could have alerted the U.S. and the world three or four months earlier does not comport with the timeline of events.
The first cases were not identified until December. Although it is unclear when exactly China may have pegged the sickness to the novel coronavirus, it was a matter of weeks between when those first cases were discovered and when the world knew about the virus. Those were critical weeks, but they weren’t months.
Sick Leave Legislation
At a March 20 press conference at the White House, Trump said, “We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers.” But the assistance isn’t available for everyone. The legislation providing the leave excludes larger companies employing nearly half of the nation’s workforce.
Under a coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump on March 18, workers are to receive paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave. But companies with 500 or more employees are not covered. In addition, the labor secretary can exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees and health care providers.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 48% of American workers are employed by companies with 500 or more employees.
The legislation provides workers with two weeks of paid leave if they are sick or quarantined or taking care of sick relatives. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to those taking care of children whose schools are closed or whose child care facilities are unavailable. The bill also provides free coronavirus testing.
Most larger companies offer their employees paid sick leave, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, but many provide fewer than the 14 days necessary for a coronavirus quarantine. The average number of paid sick days for private companies with 500 workers or more was eight after one year on the job and 10 after 20 years, based on March 2018 data.
This was not the only time the Trump administration has cited the paid leave without mentioning that many aren’t eligible for it.
For example, on March 19, Trump said: “We’re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus and more help is on the way as we speak.”
That same day, Vice President Mike Pence said, “Last night, as you heard, the president signed the Family First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, family leave for caregivers, and food assistance for the needy, among a broad range of benefits.”
Funding to Fight Diseases
In a press briefing on March 22, Trump was asked whether the proposed coronavirus economic stimulus bill would include financial assistance for countries to fight global pandemics. In response, the president said “no,” but noted that “we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries” to fight diseases. He added: “I don’t think I’ve ever said, ‘No.’ I can’t.”
Trump hasn’t proposed eliminating all funding to combat global diseases, but he has proposed reduced funding. His most recent budget proposal for fiscal year 2021, for instance, includes funding cuts for such programs.
Reporter, March 22: Are you considering any financial support for them? Let me quote to you, two retired — a retired general and a retired admiral from the U.S. Global Health Coalition: “No matter how successful we are in fighting the threat of COVID-19 pandemic at home, we’ll never stop it unless we’re also fighting it around the world.”
So, financially, is there anything in the stimulus bill? And then are you considering any financial support?
Trump: So — no, not in the stimulus bill, but we are very much — I mean, we give away billions of dollars for, as an example, AIDS in Africa. We’re still fighting that battle. It’s a tremendous battle. …
But we’re spending a lot of money with other countries. If you look at the aid that we give to other countries, we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries. And a lot of times, I say, “You know, we could save a lot of money. We shouldn’t.” And then, they come in. I say, “What’s it used for?” “It’s used to fight malaria in countries that are very poor. It’s used to fight AIDS in Africa. It’s used to fight many other things.” Many other things. And I don’t think I’ve ever said, “No.” I can’t. It’s just so terrible.
According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Trump’s most recent budget proposal requests less funding to fight diseases globally than what has been appropriated by Congress in previous years.
For example, Trump requested $3.76 billion for global HIV/AIDS programs, which is $1.59 billion less than what Congress approved in fiscal 2020 and would be the lowest amount of funding since 2007.
The president also requested $283.2 million for tuberculosis programs, or $37.6 million less than what Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2020, and $905.2 million for malaria programs, which would be a reduction of $93.9 million from the funding for the current fiscal cycle. 
Plus, Trump proposed cutting U.S. funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a publicly and privately funded international organization, by $902 million — from the $1.56 billion appropriated in FY 2020 to $658 million proposed in the president’s FY 2021 budget.
Trump’s budget would also reduce funding for neglected tropical diseases to $75 million, down more than $27 million from the enacted amount of $102.5 million for 2020. The World Health Organization says NTDs “are a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions in 149 countries and affect more than one billion people, costing developing economies billions of dollars every year.”
And, KFF says, compared with 2020, Trump’s budget request seeks almost $119 million less in 2021 for “other” services, which “includes funding for WHO and PAHO [Pan American Health Organization]; global parasitic diseases at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]; the Fogarty International Center at NIH [National Institutes of Health]; as well as the Emergency Reserve Fund, which was created in the FY17 Omnibus bill to respond to contagious infectious disease outbreaks, and would be made available if there is an ‘emerging health threat that poses severe threats to human health.’”
In fact, according to KFF’s analysis, Trump’s request of $557 million for global health security — which would be an $11 million increase from 2020 — is the only global health program area that would see an increase under Trump’s desired budget for fiscal 2021. With its global health security initiatives, including its work as part of the Global Health Security Agenda, the U.S. aims to help other countries prepare to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats worldwide.
Overall, though, “The FY 2021 President’s budget request proposes to reduce global health funding to $7.7 billion, its lowest level since FY 2008,” KFF said. And Trump has consistently sought cuts to the global health budget since he has been in office, KFF has found.
In addition to programs to fight diseases, the global health category also includes efforts to improve global nutrition and family planning and reproductive health.
As we’ve explained before, a president’s budget request is more a symbolic statement of priorities than anything Congress would enact. A March 2019 Congressional Research Service report details how Congress has repeatedly appropriated more money for certain global health programs than Trump has requested in his budgets.
But the president’s claim that he doesn’t think he has said “no” to providing funds to other countries to fight diseases ignores his budget proposals.",Robert Farley,2020-03-24 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“China has worked very hard,” Trump said, but he added that “they weren’t transparent.”

37,Trump Misleads on Reasons for Falling COVID-19 Fatality Rate,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trump-misleads-on-reasons-for-falling-covid-19-fatality-rate/,,"For nearly two months, President Donald Trump has touted an 85% decline in the nation’s COVID-19 case fatality rate since April — and has attributed the drop to improvements in treatment. But better treatment is only part of the story.
Experts say part, if not most, of the decline can be explained by expanded testing and a shift toward younger people — rather than higher-risk older folks — catching the coronavirus.
Since the end of July, Trump has wielded the impressive-sounding statistic in press briefings and rallies, playing up the effectiveness of existing therapies and claiming credit for those discoveries.
“Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus,” he said in a July 27 briefing in North Carolina, “the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April — think of that: 85%.”
In early August, Trump began mentioning specific drugs, even though several of them have yet to be proven to be effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality — and knowledge about another came from a British clinical trial.
“We’re developing a bounty of therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, antibody treatments — the antibody treatments are really working out well, really well — and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85% since April,” he said in remarks at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio on Aug. 6.
In rallies and other speeches throughout September, the mortality drop has been one of his go-to lines. “Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April,” Trump has said, with slight variation, more than 10 times, often mentioning the antiviral drug remdesivir and convalescent plasma.
In an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, Trump went so far as to suggest that current treatments are so good that they’re “pretty close to a cure.”
Trump, Sept. 12: We also have already come out with therapeutics, if you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma. You take a look at the things that we’ve come out with already and the number, we’re 85% better in terms of fatalities. You look at the kind of numbers, I don’t know if you’ve been seeing this, but we’re in — we’re really rounding the corner. And this is actually without anything further than we already have but we have some very good things out there already in terms of — I would say in terms of — you can’t use the word cure yet but pretty close to a cure. You’re going to be pretty close to a cure.
In fact, few proven therapies exist for COVID-19. 
“We are nowhere close [to] a cure,” Dr. Eric Meyerowitz, an infectious disease specialist with the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, told us in an email, “though we are certainly better off than we were in early March at the beginnings of the major surges in New York City and Boston.”
As we’ll explain, Trump’s statistic is a reference to the case fatality rate, which is an imperfect measure of mortality, as it is highly dependent on diagnostic testing. While he’s right on its precipitous drop, he gives the inaccurate impression that those gains are entirely due to treatment advances.
Increased testing and a greater proportion of infections among younger individuals are significant factors.
“More effective medical management may be playing a role in the falling case fatality rate in the US, but I suspect this improvement has been small relative to the large decrease,” said University of Pennsylvania infectious disease fellow Dr. Aaron Richterman in an email.
Case Fatality Rate
Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to repeated inquiries about the source of 85% statistic, but our colleagues at PolitiFact were told by the White House that the president was referring to the case fatality rate — and were directed to a graph made by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine and an economist at Stanford University.
The case fatality rate, or CFR, is the percentage of deaths from the coronavirus among the confirmed cases.
In the graph, which plots the CFR on a weekly basis using a two-week lag to accommodate delayed deaths, the CFR reaches nearly 30% in mid- to late-March, before falling to about 10% on April 1 and steadily declining to less than 2% by late July. 
It’s a bit unclear if Trump’s specific statistic is derived from the graph, although the approximate numbers are consistent with an 85-90% decline between the beginning of April and late July. Bhattacharya told us he shared his graph with some colleagues, but didn’t know how the White House came to be aware of it.
We arrived at a similar result looking through a COVID-19 dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using the ratio of COVID-19 deaths to probable and suspected COVID-19 cases, we calculated a crude CFR of 7.7% for all ages for the month of April. That dropped 83% to 1.3% in the month of July and further slipped to 0.9% for the month of August, for a total decline of 88% since April. (Note: The cumulative CFR remains much higher, at 3.4%, as it is predominated by the larger number of deaths early in the pandemic; the figures can be found using the visualization tool.)
Regardless of the exact data, Trump is correct that the case fatality rate has fallen substantially since April. Where he goes wrong is in attributing the steep decline to treatment improvements when other factors are also at play.
We’ve noted before the challenges in interpreting the CFR. Because it’s just a raw calculation of the number of observed deaths divided by the number of identified cases, it’s not an accurate estimate of the percentage of people who are infected with the coronavirus die, since it’s hard to know the true number of infections. 
In the beginning of the pandemic, when testing was still extremely limited, the U.S. was not capturing many of the less severe COVID-19 cases, which invariably led to an artificially high CFR. As testing expanded, more and more of those cases were included.
“In the early days, only the sickest cases were getting diagnosed, so unsurprisingly a higher % of these died relative to now, when many other cases are identified,” explained Richterman.
During the month of April, only about 5.3 million tests were performed, versus more than 23 million each in the months of July and August, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
It also matters who is getting sick, and that has also changed over time. Richterman noted that early on, many outbreaks occurred in nursing homes — places with elderly folks with underlying conditions — where COVID-19 mortality is very high.
“Now, the epidemic is being propagated more in younger people, people living in congregate settings, people doing work in close quarters with inability to socially distance, etc.,” he said. “Many of these people have an inherently lower risk of death.”
Indeed, the CDC published a report on Sept. 23 describing the changing age distribution among those infected with the coronavirus, noting that in the early months “COVID-19 incidence was highest among older adults” but that shifted to people ages 20 to 29 over the summer. That younger cohort accounted for more than 20% of cases from June to August. 
Not Yet ‘Close to a Cure’
Improvements in treatment are likely part of the reason for the declining CFR — but not the only one, as Trump suggests.
Bhattacharya, who has said the scientific community has “overreacted” to the pandemic, told us there have been “substantial improvements” in COVID-19 treatment since the start of the pandemic, including “improved protocols for ventilator use for people with severe viral pneumonia, and the availability of drugs like remdesivir and dexamethasone which have definitely improved outcomes.”
But he also said other contributors to the falling CFR were the shift toward lower-risk younger people and the fact that more widespread testing is picking up mild or asymptomatic coronavirus cases.
“I do not know of a study that … systematically decomposes these three contributors to declining CFR,” he said. “All three are important and the fact that the CFR picks up changes in all three makes it a statistic worth tracking.”
In his view, the high CFR numbers reported early on “spread fear and panic,” and he added that “[i]t seems the responsible thing to do to report that the CFR has dropped since those early days.”
Other experts were less certain of the impact of improvements in treatment.
“The mainstay of treatment for severe COVID-19 is excellent supportive care in an intensive care unit, and this has not fundamentally changed over time,” said Richterman. “That said, in areas experiencing very large epidemics (New York City comes to mind), [it’s] plausible that overwhelmed health systems were unable to provide the best possible supportive care early on in the pandemic.”
Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University’s College of Public Health, also told PolitiFact that she suspects what matters most for the declining CFR are increases in testing and the switch to more infections in younger people — and that drug advances would be “a much smaller piece of the pie.”
Richterman noted that in terms of specific therapies, only two evidence-based treatments are available: remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.
“While both might reduce risk of death, only dexamethasone has been proven to do so, and this would account for only a moderate reduction in risk of death relative to the large drop in case fatality rate,” he said.
“We have a long way to go in our treatment,” he added, contradicting the president’s rosy assessment of current COVID-19 therapies.
Although Trump frames the dexamethasone finding as an American development, it was the RECOVERY randomized controlled trial in the U.K. that first identified a mortality benefit of using the drug in select hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The finding was announced on June 16, well after the U.S.’s CFR began to fall.
To be sure, some American doctors used steroids such as dexamethasone prior to the study results, but until that point, whether the medication would hurt or help patients was unclear. And the study revealed that the drug did not help patients who did not need supplemental oxygen, and may have harmed them.
Remdesivir, which is made by the U.S. company Gilead Sciences, has not yet shown that it helps COVID-19 patients survive. The drug received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for those with severe COVID-19 on June 1 based on a study that found the drug shortened the time to recovery among hospitalized patients.
The study’s results hint at a possible survival advantage with the drug: the 14-day mortality was 7.1% among those given remdesivir versus 11.9% for those who received placebo. But Meyerowitz said the finding “did not meet statistical significance, so with the data available there is no clear mortality benefit for remdesivir for hospitalized patients.”
If additional data show that those relative mortality figures hold, he added, then those getting remdesivir would be about 30% less likely to die.
As for convalescent plasma, although some of the results are promising, it too has not yet been proven to reduce COVID-19 mortality, as we’ve written before.
Following the FDA’s EUA for plasma for hospitalized COVID-19 patients on Aug. 23, the National Institutes of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued a statement explaining that there is “no data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials” that show the therapy is safe and effective for COVID-19.
The statement noted that the FDA’s analysis of the Mayo Clinic’s Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma, which was at the core of the EUA decision, did not find a difference in seven-day survival among those given high- versus low-concentration plasma. Instead, a survival benefit was only observed in a subset of patients who were not intubated, with 11% of those receiving antibody-rich plasma dying within a week compared with 14% of patients given low-concentration plasma.
Based on the data, the panel neither recommends for nor recommends against the use of plasma.

As we’ll explain, Trump’s statistic is a reference to the case fatality rate, which is an imperfect measure of mortality, as it is highly dependent on diagnostic testing. “Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus,” he said in a July 27 briefing in North Carolina, “the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April — think of that: 85%.”
In early August, Trump began mentioning specific drugs, even though several of them have yet to be proven to be effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality — and knowledge about another came from a British clinical trial. Bhattacharya, who has said the scientific community has “overreacted” to the pandemic, told us there have been “substantial improvements” in COVID-19 treatment since the start of the pandemic, including “improved protocols for ventilator use for people with severe viral pneumonia, and the availability of drugs like remdesivir and dexamethasone which have definitely improved outcomes.”
But he also said other contributors to the falling CFR were the shift toward lower-risk younger people and the fact that more widespread testing is picking up mild or asymptomatic coronavirus cases. “Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April,” Trump has said, with slight variation, more than 10 times, often mentioning the antiviral drug remdesivir and convalescent plasma. “We’re developing a bounty of therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, antibody treatments — the antibody treatments are really working out well, really well — and many more that have allowed us to reduce mortality by 85% since April,” he said in remarks at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio on Aug. 6."
38,Video: Trump’s Misleading Attacks on Cuomo,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/video-trumps-misleading-attacks-on-cuomo/,,"In this video, we look at two misleading attacks President Donald Trump has lodged against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has been dealing with an explosion of COVID-19 infections.

Hitting back at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pleas for the federal government to provide more ventilators, Trump misleadingly claimed Cuomo rejected a 2015 recommendation to purchase 16,000 ventilators and instead “established death panels” and “lotteries.” 
Contrary to the president’s claim, a state task force in 2015 did not make a recommendation about purchasing more ventilators. That was outside the scope of the group, Valerie Gutmann Koch, the former senior attorney and special consultant to the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, told us via email. The report — “Ventilator Allocation Guidelines” — provided guidelines for New York hospitals on how they should decide which patients get ventilators in the event of a severe influenza pandemic.
Koch also said it is inaccurate to call the triage committees proposed by the New York task force “death panels.”
“The 2015 ventilator allocation protocol is intended to save the most lives in an influenza pandemic where there are a limited number of available ventilators,” Koch told us.
In a “Fox & Friends” phone interview on March 30, Trump also misleadingly noted that 4,000 ventilators delivered to New York from the federal stockpile are being kept in a “warehouse which happens to be located – which is interesting — in Edison, New Jersey,” suggesting New York didn’t need them. Cuomo said the ventilators are being stored in anticipation of peak demand in the coming weeks.

39,Flu Shot Doesn’t Cause False Positive Results for COVID-19,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/flu-shot-doesnt-cause-false-positive-results-for-covid-19/,,"Quick Take
A viral claim on Facebook erroneously tells users that “you will test positive” for COVID-19 if “you’ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years.” Vaccine and infectious disease experts told us that’s false, and the Food and Drug Administration says this hasn’t been observed in any authorized tests.


Full Story 
Social media users are spreading a baseless claim that the flu vaccine will lead to a false-positive test result for COVID-19.
“If you had a flu shot you will get likely get a false positive on a covid19 test,” a Facebook post claims. Other posts assert: “If you’ve gotten flu shots during the past ten years, you will test positive for the Wuhan strain of the Covid-19 flu.”
That’s false, according to experts in vaccines and infectious diseases — and the federal agency that authorizes such tests.
First of all, the reference to the “Covid-19 flu” is incorrect. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and coronaviruses are distinct from influenza viruses.
Flu shots are made using inactivated (not infectious) flu viruses or with a single gene from a flu virus in order to produce an immune response, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nasal spray flu vaccine is made with weakened flu viruses. It takes about two weeks after someone is vaccinated for the body to develop antibodies, which help protect against the flu.
Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview that the “PCR tests” — or polymerase chain reaction tests — used to identify active COVID-19 infections look for “genetic fragments that are unique to this coronavirus.”
Offit said there’s no cross-reaction between influenza and the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, meaning traces of influenza wouldn’t result in a positive result for COVID-19. 
Likewise, Offit said, antibody tests — or serological tests, which look for antibodies in the blood to determine past infections — “use proteins from this SARS-CoV-2, which do not cross-react with proteins from influenza.”
“They’re structurally unique,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration further told us that all FDA-authorized tests for COVID-19 are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus or influenza antibodies and that, to date, there has been no such cross-reactivity observed for any of the tests. That check on tests diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 is important given overlapping symptoms between the two illnesses, the spokesperson added.
Offit emphasized that flu vaccines do not contain coronaviruses, as we’ve previously explained. That misconception about flu vaccines may contribute to the erroneous notion that the flu shot leads to false positive COVID-19 results. (There’s also no evidence that the flu shot increases risk of COVID-19, as the CDC notes and as we’ve previously reported.)
Most flu vaccines are manufactured using chicken eggs, but about 10% in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines — which use Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells. Offit said those cells are “free from any virus.”
Many of the posts advancing the false claim attribute it to Rashid Buttar, an osteopathic doctor who has spread conspiracy theories online. Buttar has been previously reprimanded (including last year) by the North Carolina Medical Board. In 2010, he accepted a reprimand and agreed to provide patients with a consent form disclosing that the “treatment and therapies that are to be provided by Dr. Buttar have not been proven effective by traditional research studies or conventional clinical trials.”
Buttar made remarks about the false positives, similar to the Facebook claims, in a video that has appeared across social media platforms since April.
“All the way back to 1984, all the way up to now, 2018, there are multiple studies that show that if you’ve had the flu shot — especially the trivalent flu shot — false positives on COVID-19 testing,” Buttar claims. Later, he adds: “The studies clearly show that if you’ve had a flu shot, you’re going to test positive for COVID-19.”
But the novel coronavirus wasn’t discovered until late 2019, so there couldn’t have been studies between 1984 and 2018 that looked at false positive test results for the virus that causes COVID-19.
The fact-checking website Health Feedback previously debunked the same claim when it was being circulated with references to a 2012 study in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The study compared the incidence of non-influenza respiratory viruses in children who had received the trivalent flu vaccine — which protects against three different flu viruses — with those who hadn’t received the vaccine.
The study looked at four types of coronavirus that cause the common cold — not SARS-CoV-2. And, of 69 trivalent flu vaccine recipients, only one tested positive for a coronavirus — which Health Feedback notes is “insufficient to draw any causal association between the flu shot and coronavirus detection.”
Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email that “[f]lu vaccines will not cause false positive tests in people infected with SARS-CoV2. The influenza virus is very different from coronaviruses.”
“If the influenza vaccine produced antibodies against SARS-CoV2, we would not be seeing so many severe cases of Covid19,” he said. “Are these people claiming that the flu vaccine also protects against Covid19?” (It doesn’t.)
And Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Columbia University Medical Center, said he also was aware of no evidence to support the claim that flu shots would cause false positive results for COVID-19.
“The fact that there were individuals who tested negative for the coronavirus suggests that this can’t be true, as a number of them must have had flu shots, certainly within the past ten years,” he said in an email.

40,Insurance Companies Provide Coverage After COVID-19 Vaccination,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-insurance-companies-provide-coverage-after-covid-19-vaccination/,,"Insurance companies do not deny claims when someone dies after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the American Council of Life Insurers. But a viral social media post has falsely claimed that beneficiaries of a person who dies after getting the vaccine cannot collect life insurance payments.

Three COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and more than 163 million people in the U.S. — nearly 50% of the total population — had received at least one dose of vaccine as of May 25. (See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
Despite those numbers, and to the consternation of the U.S. insurance industry, a viral Instagram post has spread the falsehood that beneficiaries can’t collect the life insurance of people who had died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
The post, uploaded by an account called texasseceded, reads: “My friends aunt recently died from the COVID vaccine. She was denied her life insurance because… she willingly took an EXPERIMENTAL drug.”
We couldn’t determine the veracity of parts of this post — that someone’s aunt died after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or that a life insurance policy was not paid out for some reason. But the implication that life insurance would be denied solely because of vaccination is false.
The American Council of Life Insurers, which represents 280 companies with 95% of the industry assets in the U.S., has been calling out similar bogus claims since March, Whit Cornman, an ACLI spokesman, told us in an email.
“The fact is that life insurers do not consider whether or not a policyholder has received a COVID vaccine when deciding whether to pay a claim,” Paul Graham, senior vice president for policy development at the ACLI, said in a statement emailed to us on May 21.
“Life insurance policy contracts are very clear on how policies work, and what cause, if any, might lead to the denial of a benefit. A vaccine for COVID-19 is not one of them,” Graham said.
According to United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group, there are a number of reasons a life insurance payment can be denied, such as lying about your health on an application or if a policyholder dies during the first two years after a policy goes into effect, known as the contestability period.
“Life insurance policies are contracts that specifically state the obligations and rights of the insurance company and the insured,” Dave Wood, the Martin Chair of Insurance at the Jones College of Business at Middle Tennessee State University, told us in an email. “Some may limit cause of death to a certain cause (i.e. accidental death or cancer), but traditional policies don’t limit the cause of death. Exceptions include suicide if committed in the first two years after issuance of the policy, and war under some older policies.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received unverified reports of more than 4,600 deaths among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an alert system managed by the CDC and the FDA to detect possible safety issues in vaccines.
As we’ve reported, social media posts and websites have improperly cited the raw data from VAERS as evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths and serious events. But anyone can submit a report to VAERS, whether or not a vaccine caused the problem. 
“A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,” the CDC said. “However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.”
As we’ve written, reports of a rare blood clotting condition, mainly in adult women younger than age 50, prompted the FDA and CDC on April 13 to recommend “a pause in the use” of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine “out of an abundance of caution.”  
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted April 23 to resume the use of the J&J vaccine with a warning that it may cause the blood clotting condition. As of May 24, the agencies had identified 32 total cases among more than 10.2 million J&J vaccines administered. There have been three deaths linked to the blood clotting condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC.
Graham, of the ACLI, told us in an email on May 24 that while his group has had to correct misinformation about insurance coverage in the past, he could not recall a situation like the false claim circulating on Instagram.
“What concerns us about this falsehood is it may be leaving some consumers confused and questioning our commitment to policyholders and their families,” he said. “Life insurance is there to protect families financially if the unthinkable should happen.”
As for the vaccine, Graham said people should get it.
“Life insurers encourage all policyholders to maintain healthy habits and lifestyles, and taking preventative measures against COVID-19 is no different,” he said. “What’s most important to us is that policyholders know that nothing about the claims process or our commitment to them and their families has changed as a result of the vaccine.”",Joseph A.

41,Trump Campaign’s Misleading Ad Attacking Biden on China,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-campaigns-misleading-ad-attacking-biden-on-china/,,"The Trump campaign has launched a misleading attack ad that misrepresents Joe Biden’s statements on the Trump administration’s travel restrictions, and leaves the false impression that former U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, a Chinese-American, is a Chinese official.
The ad says that Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was opposed to President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions on China — the Biden campaign says he was for them — and generally strives to portray Biden as far too soft on the Chinese regime.
Ironically, some of Biden’s positive statements about the Chinese echo statements by Trump.
Near the end, the online ad, which debuted on YouTube on April 9 and had been viewed more than 170,000 times by the following day, seems to raise questions about Biden’s cognitive powers.
After depicting Biden as opposed to Trump’s China policies, quoting him as saying he rejected “hysterical xenophobia” and “fearmongering,” the ad pivots with the words, “until he forgot he did.” It then has a clip of Biden saying of Trump, “I complimented him on dealing with China, ” followed by an image of Biden with a goofy grin. Then it has a clip of Biden saying, “I’m not going nuts.”
The image of Biden with Locke comes about 40 seconds into the one-minute ad and is in the midst of a montage of photos of Biden with Chinese leaders. Democrats were quick to condemn the image, which provided no context, leaving the impression that Locke, who was born in Washington state and also served as governor of Washington and as President Barack Obama’s secretary of commerce, was a Chinese official.
Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who is Taiwanese-American, described the ad in a tweet as “infuriating,” adding, “Gary Locke is as American as the day is long.” Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates called for the ad to be “pulled immediately.”
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh defended the ad, tweeting, in response to the image of Biden and Locke from the ad, “The shot with the flags specifically places Biden in Beijing in 2013. It’s for a reason. That’s the Hunter Biden trip. Memory Lane for ol’ Joe.”
The new ad includes a photo of Joe and his son Hunter Biden with audio from a news report saying “Biden’s son inked a billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the Bank of China.” That’s largely accurate.
As we have reported, Hunter Biden was involved with the cross-border private equity fund involving some state-owned financial companies in China that had hoped to raise $1.5 billion in 2014 for investments. It’s unclear when that goal was reached, but the company website said as of 2019 it managed assets worth the equivalent of over $2.1 billion in U.S. dollars.
In suggesting Biden opposed Trump’s travel restrictions on China,  the ad has a clip of Biden saying, “Banning all travel will not stop it.” But that misrepresents what Biden said — and he wasn’t even talking about China.
In his March 12 speech on the novel coronavirus pandemic, Biden said, “And it will not stop, banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world may slow it, but as we’ve seen it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics rather than a risk will be counterproductive.”
So Biden was talking about the travel restrictions imposed on Europe, not China, and he was not registering blanket opposition to all travel restrictions, just those that are “based on favoritism and politics rather than a risk.”
The ad also refers twice to Biden attacking Trump for “hysterical xenophobia” to indicate his opposition to the China restrictions. That’s a matter of dispute.
As we have reported, on Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced, Biden, campaigning in Iowa, said that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.” He added, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.”
Biden didn’t mention Trump’s travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China in his speech, so it’s unclear what he meant when he criticized Trump’s “hysterical xenophobia.” The Biden campaign told us the candidate wasn’t referring to the travel rules, but rather to what it called Trump’s “long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.”
On April 3, the Biden campaign said its candidate backed the travel restrictions.
“Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. “Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.”
The ad features a number of statements by Biden wrapping China in a warm embrace: “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They’re good folks, folks.” Biden is also shown saying, “It is in our self-interest that China continue to prosper.” And “What a beautiful history we wrote together.”
But Trump, who did embark on a trade war with China, also has said many conciliatory things about the Chinese, and how the U.S. and China can help each other succeed.
For example, on Jan. 22 he tweeted, “One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA & China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country.”
In a meeting with China’s vice premier on Oct. 11, 2019, Trump said of the first phase of the trade deal reached with China, “Now we have a deal that I think ultimately is going to be just fantastic for China and fantastic for the United States.”
And on April 7, the president said at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House,  “I like China.  I like — the Chinese people are phenomenal people.”

42,Trump’s Flu Shot Reticence,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trumps-flu-shot-reticence/,,"President Donald Trump cast doubt on the value of influenza vaccines, saying he has never had the seasonal flu and only got a flu shot because he was required to as president. “I don’t know if I should have. Who knows?”
We don’t know what prompted the president’s reluctance to get a flu shot or why he questioned whether it’s a good idea, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says each year it saves thousands of lives and prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations.
The president’s hesitance about the need for a flu shot comes as medical professionals say those influenza vaccinations will be particularly important this year to lessen public confusion between seasonal flu and COVID-19, and to prevent unnecessary medical evaluations for the new coronavirus.
Trump’s comment about flu shots came during an interview with the Washington Examiner on May 14.
Trump, May 14: I never lost anybody to the flu. Look, I’ve had people having the flu. I said, “Hey, how are you doing with the flu?” They had the flu. I never had the flu. You know, the first thing they did, they want to give me a flu shot. I never had the flu. And I come to the White House, “Sir, we have to give you a flu shot.” I said, “Why?” And I took it. I don’t know if I should have. Who knows? Three times now. I’ve taken three flu shots, but anyway. …
It’s not the first time the president has expressed reticence about getting a flu shot. 
“All my life I see — I was lucky; I never had the flu,” Trump said during a Fox News virtual town hall on May 3. “Then I came here; they want to give a flu shot. And I said, ‘I don’t want a flu shot,’ but they have to give it.”
The CDC says flu shots carry very little risk and have important benefits. According to the CDC, the vaccine “can reduce flu illnesses, doctors’ visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations.” The CDC points to studies that indicate “flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.”
Although Trump said he has never known anyone who has died from the flu, seasonal influenza kills thousands of Americans each year, and infects millions.
For the 2019-2020 flu season, which ended in April, 39 million to 56 million people had flu illnesses in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the CDC. The CDC estimates last season’s flu had caused between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death.
According to the CDC, flu vaccinations — which target the three or four influenza viruses that researchers expect will be most common that season — prevent tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year. About 49% of Americans got a flu shot during the 2018-2019 flu season, and according to the CDC, that prevented: “4.4 million flu illnesses, more than the population of Los Angeles; 58,000 flu hospitalizations, about the number of students at Ohio State University; 3,500 flu deaths, equivalent to saving about 10 lives per day over the course of a year.”
Risks from getting a flu shot are low, the CDC says. “Common side effects from a flu shot include soreness, redness, and/or swelling where the shot was given, headache (low grade), fever, nausea, muscle aches, and fatigue,” according to a CDC webpage about seasonal flu shots.
“Life-threatening allergic reactions to influenza shots are very rare” the CDC  says. “There is a small possibility that influenza vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, generally no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from influenza, which can be prevented by influenza vaccine.”
A webpage produced by the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle seeks to debunk “10 flu shot myths,” including misconceptions such as that the flu shot can cause the flu, that flu shots don’t work or contain harmful ingredients, and that flu shot side effects are worse than the flu itself. The final entry speaks directly to Trump’s comments.
Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute : Myth #10: I never get the flu so I don’t need to be vaccinated. Just because you’ve been fortunate in the past doesn’t mean you’ll be so this year. As health author Tara Haelle puts it, “Millions of people have never gotten into car accidents. They still wear seat belts and carry insurance.”
Health experts say flu shots are particularly important this year to “prevent influenza and possible unnecessary evaluation for COVID-19.”
CDC Director Robert Redfield made this point when he clarified comments he made to the Washington Post on April 21. Redfield told the Post: “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. … We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.”


At a press conference the following day, Redfield said he did not mean that the COVID-19 pandemic was going to be worse next winter, but rather that it would be “more difficult and potentially complicated because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.”
“The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence,” Redfield said. “One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.”

43,Viral Video Makes False and Unsupported Claims About Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/01/viral-video-makes-false-and-unsupported-claims-about-vaccines/,,"A viral video makes a series of inaccurate and unfounded arguments for why people should not receive any vaccines, including those for COVID-19.

As COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the globe, anti-vaccination activists try to undermine people’s confidence by spreading misinformation around the safety, efficacy and value of the COVID-19 vaccines.
A 14-minute long video posted on January 13 by Steven Baker, a licensed chiropractor from Idaho, on Facebook and Instagram gives people five reasons why they “should definitely never vaccinate.” The video has been liked since by 1,600 viewers on Facebook and viewed by over 50,000 on Instagram.  
Baker, who describes himself as a healer who’s not anti-vaccine but anti-everything, has created a business selling misinformation about vaccines. In April, Facebook removed Baker’s ad account and page after he falsely claimed that a “silver spray” sold on his website protected people from COVID-19. In another video shared on TikTok and fact-checked by PolitiFact, he said people were dying because of the economic collapse caused by the pandemic, not from COVID-19.
In this video, Baker adds a disclaimer saying he’s not giving medical advice. But he is. 
Misleading Claim About Vaccine Ingredients
The first reason Baker gives to not get vaccinated is the ingredients in the vaccines. “You wouldn’t give your kid a shot of thimerosal, aluminum, aborted fetal tissue, chicken and eggs embryo — you wouldn’t,” he argues. 
But the fact is you probably already have for most of those items, and research shows the ingredients in vaccines are not harmful. Also, the two U.S. authorized COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain any of those ingredients. 
Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative used in multi-dose vaccines to help prevent potentially deadly contamination from harmful microbes. Although most vaccines for children don’t use it anymore, some influenza vaccines still do. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a kind of mercury that’s safer than methylmercury, which can be found in certain fish and animals. Ethylmercury is less toxic because it is broken down and excreted rapidly by the body. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the amount of mercury contained in a vaccine is roughly the same amount contained in a 3 ounce can of tuna fish. 
Aluminum salts are present in some vaccines. They are also found in some health products such as buffered aspirin and antacids, as well as in many foods and beverages, including fruit and vegetables, cereals, nuts, dairy products, flour, honey, and baby formula. The quantities of aluminum contained in vaccines are low and regulated. According to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the amount of aluminum infants receive in their first six months of life from vaccines is about eight times lower than what they receive from formula, and about half of what they receive from breast milk in that same amount of time. 
Some vaccines are made in eggs — the influenza and yellow fever vaccines — therefore they contain egg proteins. Eggs from chickens raised on a farm are technically chicken embryos if fertilized by a rooster. 
Finally, Baker names fetal tissue as a vaccine ingredient. That’s not accurate. Fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines, such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A. But those cells aren’t present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.
As we’ve explained, the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines aren’t made from a virus. According to the CDC, neither vaccine contains eggs, preservatives or latex.
Vaccines do not go directly into the bloodstream, as Baker says in the video. Instead, most vaccines are injected into muscle or skin.
Inaccurate Claims About Vaccine Efficacy
Baker goes on to incorrectly say that vaccines “don’t work” because they don’t “prevent the virus or bacteria from getting in your body. What they do is that they reduce the amount of symptoms that you have from that bacteria or virus.”
Many vaccines are in fact helpful precisely because they reduce symptoms — less severe disease means less suffering and fewer deaths. This is a huge part of why vaccines have been so beneficial to society.
It is true that not all vaccines can prevent infection, or do so fully. But that’s not a requirement for a vaccine to be effective. A vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a “product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.”
The idea is to train the immune system to recognize a particular pathogen so that if someone does encounter the germ, they will either not become infected or will not get sick — or if they do have symptoms, they will be less severe. This usually involves introducing a piece of or a small amount of weakened or killed virus or bacteria into the body.
Some vaccines produce what’s called sterilizing immunity, which is when antibodies glom onto a pathogen and remove it before it has a chance to enter cells and set up an infection. This happens, for example, with the measles, hepatitis A and human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccines.
“If you’re given the measles vaccine — two doses — you have a 97% chance of being protected against measles for the rest of your life. And not just disease — also asymptomatic infection,” Dr. Paul A. Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us, referring to when someone is infected but doesn’t have symptoms. “You’re done with that virus.”
Many other vaccines, Offit said, including seasonal influenza, rotavirus, whooping cough and pneumococcal vaccines, keep people from becoming seriously ill but aren’t able to prevent infection. “That’s okay,” he said, because “the main goal you’re trying to do in these cases is prevent children or adults from being hospitalized or killed.”
Importantly, many vaccines can still reduce the spread of a disease even if they don’t stop infection, contrary to Baker’s other claim that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, “don’t prevent transmission.”
That can happen, Offit said, because a vaccinated person often sheds less virus, making them less contagious.
It’s not known yet whether the authorized COVID-19 vaccines prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it’s likely the same dynamic will be at play and the vaccines will limit transmission to some degree. 
Until more is known, it’s important that people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine don’t assume they can’t pass the virus on to others — and continue to wear masks and physically distance — but it’s also premature for Baker to declare the vaccines to be useless in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
False Polio Claim
As part of Baker’s specious argument that vaccines “don’t work,” he brings up the example of polio and falsely says the disease subsided because of sanitation, not vaccination.
“Obviously, polio went away because of sanitation because it’s a fecal-oral disease,” Baker says. “And if you start washing your hands and not drinking water in the streets, you’re probably not going to get polio.”
While better sanitation helps reduce the spread of poliovirus, which is passed along primarily through feces but can also be spread through infectious droplets from sneezes or coughs, it is vaccination that is credited with eliminating the virus in the U.S. 
After all, sanitation was quite good in 1950s America, but polio was still a major threat to families every summer.
Perhaps counterintuitively, improved sanitation is thought to be why there was a surge in polio cases in the U.S. in the beginning of the early 20th century.
“Before 1910, polio was silently circulating,” explained Micaela Martinez, an infectious disease ecologist at Columbia University who has studied the history of the disease.
The virus was rampant, she said, but because virtually everyone would become infected as an infant when there is a low risk of getting severe disease and developing paralysis, it wasn’t particularly noticed.
As sanitation improved, however, children wouldn’t encounter the virus until they were older, when the risk of paralysis was greater. “So sanitation actually led to this first emergence of polio as being a widespread paralytic disease,” Martinez told us.
Polio epidemics became even worse after World War II with the baby boom, as more children were around to further spread the disease, she added. It wasn’t until vaccines arrived that cases began to fall — from more than 15,000 paralysis cases every year, according to the CDC, to fewer than 100 annually in the 1960s and fewer than 10 each year in the following decade.
The disease was eliminated in the U.S. in 1979, meaning there is no ongoing transmission of polio in the country, and no cases have originated in the U.S. since that time. Polio vaccination is still important, however, as the disease could be introduced at any time by travelers.
Vaccine Trial Misinformation
Baker proceeds to incorrectly say that there is “no such thing as a safe trial with vaccines,” because no vaccines are tested against what he considers true placebos. This is categorically false.
“What they do is they actually compare the vaccine that they’re testing to a different vaccine, or they will compare the vaccine they’re testing to a syringe that is full of aluminum and everything in the vaccine, except for the antigen,” he says, referring to the part of the vaccine that will trigger the specific immune response.
In fact, many vaccines have been tested against a saline, or saltwater, placebo in randomized controlled trials, including influenza and certain mumps, polio and measles vaccines. But there are also good reasons to use different placebo controls in trials — and it does not mean a vaccine has not been fully vetted for safety.
For example, as outlined by a World Health Organization expert panel, if a safe and effective vaccine against a specific disease already exists, then the real question becomes whether the new vaccine performs similarly or better, and in many cases it would be unethical to deprive a group of people of a protective vaccine.
It is also argued, Offit said, that it’s not fair to enroll participants in a vaccine trial and not give them something of benefit, which sometimes means giving a different vaccine as a control.
Another potential reason for deviating from a saline placebo is preserving the blinding of a trial, making sure volunteers in trials don’t know whether they have been randomly assigned to the control group, since many vaccines do have some minor, temporary side effects, such as arm soreness, that can clue participants into which shot they received.
Baker gets his facts wrong once again when says the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was tested against a meningitis vaccine. Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which are the only two COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in the U.S., were tested against a saline placebo. 
Some arms of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial did include a meningococcal vaccine as a control to reduce the chance that control volunteers would know they didn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine. That’s true of the U.K. portion of the trial and part of the Brazilian trial, which used the meningococcal group A, C, W and Y conjugate vaccine as a control for the first dose, but not the second. 
Saline, however, was used for the South African arm of the trial and the 30,000-person trial in the U.S., which is still ongoing.
Vaccine Liability
Baker also argues people should not get vaccinated because vaccines are not safe and companies are not liable.
“You cannot sue them, but yet they have a special court. And that special court to date has paid out over $4 billion in damages,” he says.
Baker is referring to the National Vaccines Injury Compensation Program, created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.
Vaccines are extensively tested to ensure they’re effective and safe. But just like any other medication, they’re not risk-free and can cause adverse events or side effects. Most vaccines can cause pain, redness or tenderness where they were injected, and some can cause more severe events.
Beginning in the mid-1970s, several lawsuits were filed against vaccine-makers and health care providers, which led manufacturers to stop their production. They were forced to pay for damages despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting injury claims. The threats of a vaccine shortage moved Congress to pass the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which creates a compensation fund. According to the latest data, the government has paid out nearly $4.2 billion in compensation since 1988.
But as we have previously explained, the fact that there have been payouts doesn’t mean that vaccines caused an injury. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, approximately 70% of all compensation awarded by the fund is a result of a negotiated settlement between the parties, previous to any review of the evidence, to save time and money. 
Still, the number of complaints and compensations is very low. Over 3.7 billion doses of covered vaccines were distributed in the U.S. from 2006 to 2018, according to the CDC. In that same period of time, only 7,589 petitions were adjudicated and of those 5,317 were compensated.
The World Health Organization estimates that immunizations prevent 2 to 3 million deaths every year globally. In the U.S., the CDC estimates flu vaccines averted 105,000 hospitalizations and 6,300 deaths in the 2019-2020 season, according to preliminary data. 
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act also requires health care providers to report side effects occurring after immunization to the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System, a program created in 1990 and co-administrated by the CDC and the FDA.
The act also allows individuals to pursue legal action against a vaccine manufacturer under certain conditions, including negligence on the part of the vaccine-maker. 
Unvaccinated Children Not Healthier
In the video, Baker falsely claims that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children and cites a study published in November 2020 in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, an open-access journal. The journal says it is peer-reviewed but its lack of rigor has been cause for concern. The quality of its publisher, Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute, has also been questioned — in 2018, 10 senior editors resigned, saying they were being pressured to receive mediocre studies.
Update, Aug. 11: The study, which claimed that kids with fewer vaccinations had fewer office visits at one of the authors’ private practices, was retracted by the journal on July 22, following concerns “regarding the validity of the conclusions.” “Adhering to our complaints procedure, an investigation was conducted that raised several methodological issues and confirmed that the conclusions were not supported by strong scientific data,” the retraction reads.
The study is co-authored by James Lyons-Weiler and Paul Thomas, and funded by The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, a nonprofit directed by Lyons-Weiler, a scientist who has been spreading misleading information on COVID-19 and vaccines for years. 
Thomas, a pediatrician in Portland, Oregon, had his license revoked in December for failing to adequately vaccinate patients. According to the Oregon Medical Board, his conduct “has breached the standard of care and has placed the health and safety of many of his patients at serious risk of harm.” One of his unvaccinated patients developed a severe case of tetanus that required a two-month stay in an intensive care unit. 
In the video, Baker baselessly accuses the CDC of profiting off vaccines and falsely states that Dr. Thomas’ license was removed because of the “truth” revealed in his study. “The CDC is not in the business to make you safe or help you and your kids, the CDC is in the business of marketing vaccines and profiting off of you and your family getting vaccinated, period,” he argues.  
Vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity and prevents potential life-threatening diseases, according to the CDC. All vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, meet rigorous safety criteria set by the FDA.
“The fact of the matter is, not shockingly, people who are vaccinated are healthier because they’re not likely to catch bacterial and viral infections,” Offit said. “There’s not a year that goes by at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia where we do not see a child suffer and die from a vaccine-preventable disease because the parent chose not to vaccinate them.”
Unsupported Claim About Autoimmune Diseases
The top reason to avoid all vaccinations, Baker baselessly says, is that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases. He even goes so far as to say that COVID-19 vaccines will “create millions and millions of people with an autoimmune disease.” There is no evidence for that.
Baker betrays his lack of knowledge on the subject by claiming this happens because with vaccines you are “bypassing natural defenses” instead of “having a true actual immune response” and by likening vaccination to getting an organ transplant in which you need drugs to suppress the immune system.
But vaccination is nothing like an organ transplant. And vaccines only temporarily activate the immune system, doing so in a safer way than natural infection.
“Since vaccines don’t drive the immune response nearly as vigorously as natural infections do, it is less likely that they would induce autoimmunity,” explains the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s website.
Scientists have looked into whether vaccines trigger autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and have come up empty, with no clear signal that they do.
“It’s okay to ask the question,” Offit said, “but when study after study after study shows that vaccines don’t induce autoimmunity and it doesn’t make sense they would induce autoimmunity, people should believe them.”
One autoimmune disorder, Guillain-Barré syndrome, has been linked to influenza vaccination, but inconsistently so — and at very low frequencies, around 1 to 2 in 1 million doses. Most people who develop the condition fully recover, although some people are left with permanent nerve damage and some people die.
Cases of the disease also follow infections, and research shows that the risk of developing Guillain-Barré from flu is much higher than after immunization with a flu shot.
In another rare instance, a pandemic flu vaccine in Europe in 2009-2010 may have provoked some people with a genetic predisposition to develop an autoimmune reaction that led to narcolepsy. But in that case as well, it’s not entirely clear what role the vaccine played, and it’s possible natural infection with influenza poses a similar or higher risk.
While scientists continue to monitor for any sign that immunizations might lead to autoimmunity, there is no basis for Baker’s claim that vaccines, including those for COVID-19, are dangerous because they cause autoimmune diseases.

44,Asthma Medicine Not Proven as COVID-19 ‘Cure’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/asthma-medicine-not-proven-as-covid-19-cure/,,"Quick Take
A viral headline on Facebook claims that a vaccine isn’t “Needed” for COVID-19 because “There Is Already A Cure.” But the supposed “cure” is an asthma medication, touted by a Texas doctor, that has not yet been proven in clinical trials as an effective treatment for COVID-19 — though researchers are exploring its efficacy.


Full Story 
In a video interview shared on social media in early July, a Texas doctor promised a “silver bullet” and “cure” for COVID-19.
The answer, Dr. Richard Bartlett claimed, is an existing asthma medicine — inhaled budesonide, a corticosteroid — whose success, he suggests, negates the need for a vaccine. The video has racked up 4 million views on YouTube and its claims have migrated elsewhere. A headline shared on Facebook nearly 40,000 times, for example, claims that “COVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure.”
But experts say the medication has not yet been proven as an effective treatment for COVID-19 and, even if helpful, wouldn’t dismiss the need for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus that causes the disease — which would help to prevent people from becoming sick in the first place. The World Health Organization also notes that there is “currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19.”
Bartlett, a general practice doctor who initiated a short-lived run for Congress as a Republican in 2019, said in his interview on the conservative talk show “America Can We Talk?” that he uses a nebulizer machine to administer the budesonide. He said he also uses zinc and clarithromycin, an antibiotic.
“My silver bullet is inhaled budesonide,” he said. “It works. One hundred percent of my patients are alive.” He said that patients “tell me, ‘I feel better during the first treatment,’ and so their chest pain goes away, their shortness of breath goes away, their fever breaks.”
In describing the success of one patient, he refers to the treatment as a “cure.”
Mona Bafadhel, associate professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Oxford, told us in an email that “there is NO evidence to suggest that inhaled budesonide or any inhaled steroids (ICS) is a cure for COVID.” (Emphasis is hers.)
Bafadhel is currently conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the use of inhaled budesonide to treat patients with early COVID-19 infection.
“If ICS were proven to be successful, as a treatment, this would NOT mean we don’t need a vaccine,” she said.
(Update, Feb. 10, 2021: Unpublished results from Bafadhel’s study, posted to the preprint server medRxiv, suggest that giving inhaled budesonide soon after developing symptoms can reduce the need for urgent care or hospitalization and shorten recovery time.)
Dr. Mitchell Grayson, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital at Ohio State University College of Medicine, also said in a phone interview that “the jury is out” on whether inhaled corticosteroids will help with treatment of COVID-19. Grayson briefly evaluated the dearth of evidence available on the issue for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.
“I don’t see any strong signals that would make me think that inhaled steroids are going to be remarkably better,” he said, but a clinical trial is the only way to know more definitively.
Grayson said one possibility is that the steroid could help temper the immune system’s overreaction to the disease, since that overreaction can lead people to getting seriously ill.
Bartlett recently started a website, “covidsilverbullet.com,” where he has published a case study of inhaled budesonide that involves two patients treated via telemedicine. The patients — a 63-year-old woman and 38-year-old man — both are reported to have preexisting conditions and use other medications, too.
“It’s very hard to make any kinds of heads or tails out of” the case study, Grayson said.
A large, randomized clinical trial in the U.K. by the RECOVERY group found that 22.9% of COVID-19 patients allocated dexamethasone — another steroid — by mouth or intravenously died within 28 days, as opposed to 25.7% of patients allocated usual care. It was most effective among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.
The study only looked at hospitalized patients and did not look at inhaled steroids. It also did not find a benefit for those not receiving respiratory support.
In a July 30 commentary for The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Bafadhel and Dan Nicolau, a physician and mathematician at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, lay out the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids “could be a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 for several reasons.”
“We would propose that ICS could have a dual role: first, reducing the inflammatory [acute respiratory distress syndrome-like] response affecting a minority of patients with COVID-19; and second, directly inhibiting viral replication,” they note. They later add: “Whether use of ICS protects against COVID-19 is still unknown, but to dismiss this hypothesis as nonsense is premature.”
In addition to Bafadehl’s study, there are several other clinical trials also exploring inhaled corticosteroids and COVID-19.
But in the viral video, Bartlett dubiously suggests the medication is already being used so widely as to keep COVID-19 fatalities low in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland. “They’re doing what I’m doing … an inhaled steroid,” he claims.
The WHO, in a statement provided to FactCheck.org, said “there is no evidence suggesting that inhaled corticosteroid have reduced case fatality rate in Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, and Iceland.”
Taiwan, with a population of nearly 24 million, has reported only 475 COVID-19 cases and seven deaths — but it’s not because of an inhaled steroid, said Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy research analyst at Princeton University who has written about Taiwan’s health care system and closely follows the country’s COVID-19 response.
Cheng said in a phone interview that she had “never” heard of such a treatment being responsible for low fatalities. Instead, she said the country prepared itself for such a crisis in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. She said the country’s leadership (including a central command system), a national policy, and “very, very strict, effective quarantine and contact tracing” protocols helped to prevent the disease from spreading within the country.
The WHO statement also said that “[t]here is limited information on possible effect of inhaled steroids and there is no evidence there is any advantage to use this route of administration to improve patient outcomes.” (Emphasis is theirs.)
“Available evidence from randomized clinical trials such as RECOVERY suggest that systemic corticosteroids” — meaning, taken orally or through a shot — “provide benefits in reducing mortality in severe and critically ill patients requiring respiratory support,” it noted. “In addition, data indicate that [there is] no benefit of systemic corticosteroids in patients who did not require supplemental oxygen.”
Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security who studies infectious diseases, also said in an email that “[t]here is no definitive evidence to support the use of inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide in the treatment of COVID-19. While there is biological plausibility that such a treatment could have a beneficial role it can only be determined in a proper clinical trial.”
Adalja cautioned that “[w]hen it comes to steroid treatments for COVID19 it is important to realize that, as was shown with systemic steroid treatment, there is an appropriate and inappropriate time to administer them.” He also said “inhaled corticosteroids are not benign and have a range of side effects that range from osteoporosis to making one more vulnerable to bacterial pneumonia so I would not advise the use of such treatments for COVID19 outside of a clinical trial or protocol (though those prescribed them for other reasons should continue taking them).”

In a subsequent interview, with the conservative outlet One America News Network, Bartlett said that a hospital in Texas south of San Antonio — Frio Regional Hospital — “emptied” its ICU of COVID-19 patients by using inhaled budesonide.
The CEO of the hospital, John Hughson, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the hospital, which typically has a 25-bed capacity, did use inhaled budesonide on three patients in a room converted into an ICU — and that they improved several days later and were discharged. He said he believes the inhaled budesonide can be effective for some patients and that while some doctors at the hospital use it, others haven’t adopted it.
Hughson noted that “it is a very, very small sample size and all those patients were on high-flow oxygen.”
“It’s up to the physician’s discretion and their medical judgment … if they initiate the therapy at all,” he said. “I would also say that’s not the only treatment we use.”
“I wouldn’t say this is indicated for every patient, it is not the magic cure for everything, and it is not going to keep everyone from getting the disease,” he added.
On that point, Bartlett also suggested — in his earlier interview — that a vaccine isn’t needed if inhaled budesonide is being widely used. For example, after advancing the baseless claim about Taiwan’s wide adoption of the steroid, he says: “Taiwan, 24 million people, they don’t need to wait for a vaccine — they don’t have a problem that you should vaccinate 24 million people for.”

Adalja, however, said that “no treatment will obviate the need for a vaccine — a vaccine is the only way to remove this virus as a threat to human health.”
And Cheng, who said she has spoken recently with both Taiwan’s former health minister and the current health minister, dismissed the suggestion that the country isn’t in need of a vaccine. She said Taiwan is putting many resources into vaccine development and negotiating with vaccine manufacturers to ensure that, when one is ready, the country can procure enough doses to begin with protecting health care workers — followed by the rest of the population.

Mona Bafadhel, associate professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Oxford, told us in an email that “there is NO evidence to suggest that inhaled budesonide or any inhaled steroids (ICS) is a cure for COVID.” (Emphasis is hers.) In a July 30 commentary for The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Bafadhel and Dan Nicolau, a physician and mathematician at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, lay out the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids “could be a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 for several reasons.”
“We would propose that ICS could have a dual role: first, reducing the inflammatory [acute respiratory distress syndrome-like  response affecting a minority of patients with COVID-19; and second, directly inhibiting viral replication,” they note. A headline shared on Facebook nearly 40,000 times, for example, claims that “COVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure.”
But experts say the medication has not yet been proven as an effective treatment for COVID-19 and, even if helpful, wouldn’t dismiss the need for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus that causes the disease — which would help to prevent people from becoming sick in the first place. The answer, Dr. Richard Bartlett claimed, is an existing asthma medicine — inhaled budesonide, a corticosteroid — whose success, he suggests, negates the need for a vaccine."

The video reviews these statements that the president made in his April 14 announcement: 

Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claim that if he hadn’t put restrictions on travel from China, “probably hundreds of thousands more” would have died from the novel coronavirus. Research shows travel restrictions can delay the exportation of cases, but they can’t contain the spread of viruses.
The president exaggerated when he said the WHO “actually fought” the U.S. over his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. WHO has advised countries not to enact travel restrictions, but WHO leaders have not publicly criticized the U.S.’ decision. 
Trump accused the WHO of taking “China’s assurances” about the coronavirus “at face value … even praising China for its so-called transparency.” But early on Trump also thanked China for “their efforts and transparency.”
The president said the WHO failed to investigate “credible reports” of human-to-human transmission in December 2019, claiming the agency said the virus “was not communicable.” But the WHO wasn’t notified of an outbreak in Wuhan until Dec. 31, and it never said the virus wasn’t communicable.

46,A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/a-guide-to-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine/,,"The first COVID-19 vaccine to go into any American arms outside of a trial — and the first to be fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration — is Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine, which was designed and developed by the German biotech company BioNTech. Here, we give a rundown of basic facts about the vaccine and an overview of how it works.
Quick Summary
Vaccine name: BNT162b2, marketed as Comirnaty
Design type: mRNA
Dose number: 2, 21 days apart, with a third dose recommended for certain immunocompromised people. A third “booster” dose is also recommended for people 50 years of age and older and other groups at increased risk; all adults may receive one.
Efficacy: 91% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in people 16 years of age or older a week or more after receipt of the second dose.
Safety: No serious safety concerns reported other than some rare allergic reactions and a likely, but rare, association with heart inflammation. The shots routinely elicit a fairly strong temporary reaction in many people that can include injection site pain, fatigue, headache and chills.
Expected dose availability: Worldwide, up to 50 million doses, or enough for approximately 25 million people, by the end of 2020, with up to 1.3 billion doses expected in 2021.
Timeline: First doses were administered in December 2020 to prioritized populations, following the FDA’s emergency use authorization on Dec. 11.
Operation Warp Speed involvement: No support for the trials or research and development, but the U.S. government inked a $1.95 billion deal in July as part of OWS to buy 100 million doses. In December and February the U.S. announced agreements to purchase another 100 million doses each, for a total of 300 million doses to be delivered by the end of July 2021.
Storage considerations: Ultracold freezer temperatures of -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF) for long-term storage, with up to two weeks at standard freezer temperatures; after thawing, undiluted vaccine vials can be stored at refrigerator temperatures for up to a month. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the U.S. and the first to be fully approved by the FDA.  The companies released promising interim results from a phase 3 trial on Nov. 9, and on Nov. 18 announced an efficacy of 95% in preventing disease.
Two days later, the company submitted its application to the FDA to receive an emergency use authorization, or EUA, for its vaccine in people 16 years of age and older. The FDA conducted a thorough review — including an analysis of the raw data — of the vaccine’s safety and efficacy, and issued an EUA on Dec. 11.
A day prior to the FDA’s authorization, an outside panel of experts advising the agency also backed the vaccine in a 17 to 4 vote, with one abstention, that based on the evidence available, “the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older.”
Based on additional clinical trial data from adolescents, the FDA amended its EUA for the vaccine on May 10 to include teens ages 12 to 15. The agency also revised the EUA on Aug. 12 to allow for third doses of the vaccine in certain immunocompromised people.
On Aug. 23, the FDA granted full approval to the vaccine for people 16 years of age and older. The vaccine remains available under emergency use to children as young as 12 and as a third dose to select immunocompromised people. A distinct pediatric version of the vaccine, with one-third as much mRNA, is authorized for children ages 5 through 11. For more on that vaccine, see “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine for Kids 5-11.”
The FDA has also authorized third dose “boosters” for non-immunocompromised people. After initially restricting eligibility to people 65 years of age and older and adults at higher risk, the agency expanded booster access to all adults on Nov. 19. A CDC advisory committee concluded that anyone 50 years of age and older or with risk factors “should” receive one, while adults below 50 without risk factors “may” receive one.
“Streamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a press release announcing the expansion.
Pfizer/BioNTech Q&A
What is in the vaccine and how does it work?
As with most other COVID-19 vaccine designs, the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine works by triggering an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which sits on the surface of the virus and is what the virus uses to enter cells.
The vaccine is made of modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, wrapped in a special blend of fatty molecules known as lipid nanoparticles. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make their own spike proteins, prompting the body to generate protective antibodies and activate T cells. The lipids help deliver the RNA into cells and prevent it from being degraded too quickly.
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained, there is no way to catch COVID-19 from this type of vaccine because the vaccine is not made of a virus. And because the mRNA from the vaccine doesn’t enter the nucleus — the part of the cell that houses DNA — it “does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA,” contrary to some online rumors.
How was the vaccine developed?
German company BioNTech designed multiple mRNA vaccine candidates after the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus became public in January 2020 and partnered with Pfizer in March 2020.
Early phase clinical trials showed that two leading mRNA designs triggered neutralizing antibody responses that were better than those from people recovering from natural COVID-19 infection, with no serious adverse events. 
But one candidate — BNT162b2, which prompts cells to make a full-length spike protein — did so with fewer side effects than the other. Based on the trial results and preclinical tests  in animals, the companies decided to move forward to a combined phase 2/3 randomized controlled trial testing two 30 microgram doses of BNT162b2 on volunteers.
The phase 2/3 trial began in late July 2020, ultimately enrolling around 46,000 people in the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa and Turkey. Enrollment was expanded past the 30,000 initial target in September 2020 to include people infected with HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and to add teens as young as 16 years old. In October 2020, the age requirement was lowered to 12 years old. Because of the limited data available on this population at the time of submission, however, Pfizer did not ask to include the 12- to 15-year-old age group in its original EUA request.
Pfizer is conducting additional studies in children below the age of 12.
How effective is the vaccine?
In the updated trial results reported to the FDA for full approval, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 91% effective in preventing symptomatic disease at least a week after the second dose in people 16 years of age and older.
This does not mean that the vaccine works 91% of the time or that 9% of vaccinated people will fall ill with COVID-19. Instead, as Emory University biostatistician Natalie Dean and the World Health Organization have explained, the percentage refers to a relative reduction in risk, such that a vaccinated person is 91% less likely to get sick compared with an unvaccinated person.
In the updated analysis, which included around 20,000 participants each in the vaccine and placebo groups, there were 833 symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the placebo group and 77 in the vaccine group.
Pfizer previously reported an efficacy of 95% in preventing disease in people 16 years of age and older, based on 162 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in the placebo group and eight in the vaccine group. It was this data that served as the basis of the FDA’s initial EUA for the vaccine in December 2020. 
According to the FDA’s summary explaining its approval decision, vaccine efficacy for the updated trial was similar across a variety of demographics, including gender, ethnic groups and those at high risk of severe COVID-19.
Protection against severe disease was also very high. Depending on the case definition for severe COVID-19, the vaccine was either 95% or 100% effective in the updated trial.
Vaccine efficacy, which is the metric measured in a randomized controlled trial, is different from vaccine effectiveness, which refers to the real-world performance of the vaccine, as measured in observational studies. Vaccines may not do quite as well in a wider population outside the idealized conditions of a trial.
Efficacy figures also only reflect the vaccine’s performance after a certain amount of time and against the type of virus circulating in the population at the time of testing. In the case of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, that did not include the highly contagious delta variant, but did include some locations where the beta variant was prevalent; the period of follow-up was up to around six months after receiving a second dose.
At the same time, observational studies used to estimate effectiveness are more prone to bias compared with randomized controlled trials.
Since the vaccine’s rollout, numerous observational studies have demonstrated the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine’s effectiveness in the real world, including against the delta variant, although there may be a decline in protection against infection and mild disease compared with previous viral variants. 
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July, for example, found that the two-dose vaccine was 88.0% effective in preventing symptomatic disease with delta in the U.K., down from 93.7% against the previously dominant alpha variant.
Other studies from the U.S. also suggest a moderate decrease in the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection, either due to waning immunity over time, the delta variant or some combination of the two. 
In a study of New York residents, about half of whom were immunized with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, vaccine protection against infection fell from 92% to 75% between early May and late July. Another study of nursing home residents from across the U.S. found that the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against infection declined from 74% in the pre-delta era to 53% with delta.
There is little sign, however, of a similar drop in protection against serious disease, hospitalization or death. In the New York study, vaccine protection against hospitalization remained at 90% or higher. Another evaluation, which pulled information from across 18 U.S. states, found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines stayed 84% to 86% effective in preventing hospitalization for 24 weeks.
It remains unknown how long vaccine protection lasts. For some people who are immunocompromised, data suggest that two doses may be insufficient and those individuals might benefit from an additional dose.
For people who are healthy, Pfizer is conducting additional studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a third “booster” dose of its vaccine. In late August, the company announced positive results of giving a booster — an increase in neutralizing antibodies with similar side effects to the two-dose regimen.
In September, the FDA authorized a booster dose, given at least six months after the initial two-dose series, for the elderly and other populations at increased risk.
In October, Pfizer released clinical trial data showing a booster reduced the chance of falling ill with COVID-19 by 95.6% compared with those who were fully vaccinated but had not received a booster. The FDA expanded booster eligibility to all adults in mid-November.
Evidence suggests people vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine who become infected with the coronavirus can pass it on to others, although they are less likely to do so compared with unvaccinated people.
How safe is the vaccine?
In clinical trials and in subsequent safety monitoring, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been shown to be very safe. 
While many people experience unpleasant side effects, the vaccine only very rarely appears to cause more serious problems. 
This includes serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, and an increased risk of inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or its surrounding tissue (pericarditis). Both of these adverse events, while potentially dangerous, are uncommon and treatable.
Anaphylaxis refers to a life-threatening reaction that usually occurs within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergic substance. All vaccination sites are equipped to deal with allergic reactions.
People getting the vaccine should be prepared for irksome side effects, including pain, redness and swelling at the site of injection, as well as fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever.
According to the clinical trial data, these types of reactions were relatively common and tended to be more frequent and severe in younger people.
The only people the FDA says should not receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or one of its ingredients. The CDC advises not getting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine if you have had any kind of immediate reaction, even if not severe, to a dose of the vaccine or one of its ingredients, such as polyethylene glycol.
The agency also recommends consulting with your physician if you have ever had an immediate allergic reaction to other vaccines or injectable therapies.
Data presented to the CDC advisory committee showed a rate of 5.0 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as of July 31, which is slightly higher than 1 to 2 per million instances that occur with other vaccines. The crude estimated frequency of anaphylaxis, as reported in the FDA’s summary accompanying the approval, is 6.0 cases per million doses.
In late June, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded there is a “likely association” between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis in teens and young adults.
As of Nov. 10, the agency says there have been 1,793 preliminary reports of either condition in people 12 through 29 years of age following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine.
Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. Early evidence, ACIP said, suggests these myocarditis cases are less severe than typical ones. The CDC has also noted that most patients who were treated “responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.”
According to an FDA Q&A, the agency has concluded that the safety surveillance data “demonstrate increased risks” of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
In its approval summary, the FDA said the reporting rates for confirmed cases of myocarditis or pericarditis are higher in males under the age of 40 and are highest in male teens 12 to 17 years of age, at approximately 65 cases per million doses administered. The conditions are also more common after the second dose and within a week of vaccination. “Although some cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis required intensive care support,” the FDA summary reads, “available data from short-term follow up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management.”
The agency conducted its own benefit-risk assessment and concluded that even in a “worst-case” scenario, in which myocarditis and pericarditis cases were more frequent than currently observed, the vaccine was less effective than expected and COVID-19 transmission was low, the benefits of vaccination would outweigh the risks.
A study from Israel, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Aug. 25, similarly identified vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as being associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis, at the rate of 2.7 additional cases per 100,000 people. But that risk was still much lower than the risk of the same condition in people who contracted the coronavirus, which was at a rate of 11 additional cases per 100,000 people.
The FDA is requiring Pfizer to conduct six studies to better understand the risk of the inflammatory heart conditions after vaccination. The CDC is also conducting its own survey to investigate potential long-term effects.
Why does the vaccine need to be kept so cold?
The extreme cold is necessary to keep the highly sensitive lipid-encapsulated RNA molecules from degrading. Logistically, this cold chain requirement poses an extra hurdle in distributing the vaccine, since many potential vaccination sites lack the appropriate ultracold freezers and may not have a ready source of dry ice.
Pfizer has tried to mitigate some of these challenges by creating specialized “thermal shippers” for its vaccine that will maintain ultracold temperatures for up to 10 days if unopened and can store vials for as long as a month if refilled every five days with dry ice.
On Feb. 25, the FDA also began allowing the vaccines to be shipped or stored at regular freezer temperatures for up to two weeks, following data showing that the doses would remain stable under such conditions. In May, the agency extended the time undiluted vials could be kept in a refrigerator to a month, up from the original five days.
Rival company Moderna, which also used an mRNA design for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, also requires freezing temperatures, but they are less severe, due to differences in the particular lipid nanoparticles used. The company announced in November that its vaccine should remain stable long-term at standard freezer temperatures and should last for 30 days in a refrigerator.

47,Photo of Lebanese Reporter Used to Criticize U.S. Media,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/photo-of-lebanese-reporter-used-to-criticize-u-s-media/,,"A picture of a reporter in protective medical gear has fueled claims on social media accounts dedicated to American politics that the media “hypes” the COVID-19 pandemic. The photo actually shows a team in Lebanon reporting on a local factory that makes protective suits.
A picture of a television reporter wearing a disposable, protective jumpsuit and face mask, while her cameraman is in regular street clothes, has been circulating on social media, prompting condemnation of the media for supposedly sensationalizing coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.
None of those posts explain that the picture is from Lebanon or that the reporter for the Al Arabiya television channel was working on a story about a factory that had just begun making the protective suits.
Instead, Facebook pages dedicated to American political issues have been posting a version of the picture paired with text that says: “Reporter in full bio gear, Camera man in street Cloths. think the media hypes this thing a little?”
A page called Hawaii Republican Action shared it with this caption: “The leftist government-media hype machine is in full overdrive.” And a page called America 1776 shared it with this: “You still believe this isn’t political??”
But the picture actually came from a video taken while a reporter was filming on a street in Beirut. Another journalist posted the eight-second video clip to Twitter in March with his own commentary on the decision to wear protective gear. That video, which was posted March 18, has been viewed nearly 2 million times. 
Ghinwa Yatim, the reporter featured in the clip, responded to criticism on Twitter on March 20.

48,"Sequencing Used to Identify Delta, Other Coronavirus Variants",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-sequencing-used-to-identify-delta-other-coronavirus-variants/,,"Researchers use genomic sequencing — not the clinical tests used to diagnose patients with COVID-19 — to identify and track specific variants of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, including the highly contagious delta variant. But viral posts try to deny the existence of the variant by misleadingly claiming there is “no ‘Delta Variant’ test.”

The delta variant of the novel coronavirus — now the dominant version of the virus in the U.S. — has presented additional challenges as the country tries to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The highly contagious variant is responsible for a surge in outbreaks across the country, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. Vaccines still protect against the variant, especially against serious illness and death, but may be less effective against delta compared to other forms of the virus.
Yet false and misleading claims have recently sought to not only cast doubt on the seriousness of the variant, but question its existence.

One such meme shared on Facebook more than 12,000 times misleadingly asks, “Since there is no ‘Delta Variant’ test, how exactly are people being diagnosed with the ‘Delta Variant’?”
The same question was presented in a July 26 tweet shared by thousands that was posted by Errol Webber, a film producer and Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in California last year. Similar posts have been shared hundreds of times each.
Adding to the misperception, at a White House press briefing July 30, Emerald Robinson, a reporter for the conservative outlet Newsmax, asked, of the delta variant, “How do you test, when — that it’s the dominant strain in the area, when people just test whether they’re COVID positive?”
White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, seemingly perplexed, said “we don’t test it” and that “we listen to public health and scientists, and they tell us that it’s the Delta variant.”
On Twitter, Robinson — who has nearly 400,000 followers — has since misleadingly claimed that “the Biden Administration is unable to provide any proof that Delta variant is real” and later that the administration “has no idea how to test for the Delta variant.”
But the various posts trying to cast doubt on the validity of the delta variant betray a lack of understanding of how variants are being identified and tracked. There is testing to identify delta and other variants, but it’s more sophisticated than the routine clinical testing — often by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests — used to simply determine whether someone has COVID-19.
Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, an associate professor of pathology and medicine at Stanford University, told us in a phone interview that it’s worth first noting that “all the diagnostic tests are capable of detecting the delta variant — they just don’t distinguish it from different lineages.” In other words, the PCR tests do detect the delta variant as SARS-CoV-2.
Identifying and tracking specific variants, however, requires additional analysis.

To do that, scientists use a process called genomic sequencing. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, sequencing is a way to decode the genes of a virus to better understand factors such as its spread and evolution.
John Everett, who helps conducts such research at Penn Medicine to understand the virus’ presence in the Delaware Valley, explained it this way: “Research institutions, including Penn, study samples collected from the community by sequencing viral genomes in those samples. We identify mutations in the genomes, compared to the original Wuhan strain, where groupings of specific mutations are used to define viral variants or lineages.”
“We track the relative rise and fall of different lineages which we can break apart by zip code to build a picture of how the different lineages are spreading in our area,” Everett, the bioinformatics director for the University of Pennsylvania lab group behind the research, told us by email.
The group’s data show how the delta variant has rapidly become the main lineage identified in most samples tested from the University of Pennsylvania Health System.
Some findings done through PCR tests can provide insights into the suspected lineage present. For example, the alpha variant — first identified in the United Kingdom in September 2020 — caused PCR failures involving the virus’ S gene, which codes for the surface spike protein, because of the variant’s mutations.
The phenomenon of variants causing test issues is expected, Everett said, which is why PCR tests check against “multiple regions of the viral genome.” That’s “another reason why surveillance is important — to identify mutations in the community which may interfere with tests and adjust the tests as needed,” he said.
Dr. Marie-Louise Landry, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Yale New Haven Hospital, noted that the S gene issue “was only suggestive of alpha” since it was only one of the characteristic mutations of alpha. Sequencing the whole genome, she told us by email, is still needed to confirm that it was indeed the alpha variant.
Pinsky, who is also medical director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory for Stanford Health Care, said his lab runs a second, different PCR test on samples that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 to look for specific mutations that are seen in variants of concern and variants of interest prior to sequencing.
For the delta variant, Pinsky said, what’s known as the L452R mutation is often a telling sign: About 94% of the samples analyzed by his lab that show that mutation are proven to be delta once sequenced, he said. Moreover, about 90% of all positive samples recently sequenced by his lab are delta, he said.
“Delta is certainly not a hoax,” Pinsky said.
And while some of the viral posts online suggest patients are being “diagnosed” with the delta variant, all the experts we consulted said that patients would not be typically informed of the lineage identified — though, in areas with predominantly delta transmission, patients may be able to make inferences.
Dr. Atul Butte noted to us in an email that sequencing analyses “are NOT clinical tests.”
“These sequences are used for public health tracking and epidemiology,” said Butte, a University of California, San Francisco pediatrics and epidemiology professor who also directs the university’s Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. “We wouldn’t deliver any different medical care right now, based on whether one variant is present or another.”

49,Primer on Trump’s Visit to Georgia,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/primer-on-trumps-visit-to-georgia/,,"For the first time since Election Day, President Donald Trump will stage a political rally — traveling to Valdosta, Georgia, to campaign on Dec. 5 for the state’s two Republican senators.
Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler were unable to get 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, forcing both into Jan. 5 runoff elections against their respective Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.
In advance of Trump’s visit, we recap here our fact-checking reports on the Georgia races — which will decide control of the Senate.
We also review the president’s false, misleading and unfounded statements about alleged election fraud in Georgia — a state that President-elect Joe Biden won by nearly 13,000 votes, according to the state’s certified election results.
Trump’s Election Fraud Allegations
Georgia signature checks: In a nearly 46-minute video that he posted on social media on Dec. 2, Trump wrongly claimed Georgia didn’t properly check signatures from mail-in ballots and misleadingly claimed the signature checks were left out of the recount.
“In the recent recount in Georgia, which means nothing because they don’t want to check signatures, and if you’re not going to check signatures in Georgia, it doesn’t work,” Trump said. “But we have a secretary of state, and a governor who made it very difficult to check signatures.”
As we have written, Georgia election officials check signatures twice: once when a voter requests a mail-in ballot, and then again when the ballot is returned. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said Georgia strengthened its signature match for this election, and trained election officials on Georgia Bureau of Investigation signature-matching techniques. Trump is correct that signature checks were not part of the hand recount. Once a signature is verified on the ballot’s outer envelope, the ballot is separated from the envelope for counting. This protects voter privacy.
Rejected ballots in Georgia: Trump again falsely claimed that the percentage of ballots rejected in Georgia was suspiciously low.
“In swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience,” Trump said. “In Georgia, just 0.2%, that’s substantially less than 1%, of mail-in ballots have been rejected. … Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016.”
As he has in the past, Trump is conflating the ballots rejected just for signature issues in this election with ballots rejected in past elections for all reasons — usually for arriving too late. The percentage of mail-in ballots rejected in Georgia due to signature issues this year was about the same as in the 2016 and 2018 general elections.
Missed votes in Georgia: Trump falsely suggested that many votes from Trump supporters in Georgia remain uncounted. “Thousands of uncounted ballots were discovered in Floyd, Fayette, and Walton counties weeks after the election, and these ballots were mostly from Trump voters. They weren’t counted. They were from Trump voters,” he said.
It’s true that almost 6,000 previously uncounted or unreported votes in those counties (and Douglas County) were discovered by officials during Georgia’s hand recount of ballots after the election. But those votes for Trump and Biden have since been included in the overall tallies and didn’t change the outcome.
Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, said that after including those additional votes for both candidates, Biden’s lead over Trump narrowed from 14,156 votes to 12,781 votes.
See “Trump’s ‘Most Important’ Speech Was Mostly False” for more.

Biden-only voters: In a Nov. 29 interview on Fox News, Trump baselessly said that “there were a lot of ballots where it was just Biden on top,” and no other candidates selected in the other races, because Democrats were rushing to forge ballots for Biden.
“They say that I was doing so much better than they thought that they panicked, and they started just doing ballot after ballot very quickly and just checking the Biden name on top. They didn’t have time,” Trump said, not explaining who “they” were. “So, you have all these ballots with just one name checked. People don’t vote that way.”
In making this unsupported claim, Trump repeated a flawed conspiracy theory that one of his campaign advisers, Steve Cortes, previously had suggested about Georgia. Cortes claimed “there were almost 96,000 people in Georgia, allegedly, who voted Biden-only and then did not vote for Senate.”
Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us it is not possible to know how many Georgians voted for Biden and no other candidate. That “would require individual-level information from ballots, not aggregation information about ballots cast in each race,” he said. 
Instead, while Biden garnered more votes than Ossoff in Georgia, that’s likely because of ticket-splitting, when a voter picks a presidential candidate of one party and a Senate candidate of another party, and “ballot roll-off,” which is when voters skip certain races.
See “Trump Repeats Baseless, False Claims About the Election” and “Faulty Claim About ‘Biden-Only’ Ballots in Georgia” for more.

Two days after Election Day, Trump made several unfounded, baseless and specious claims at the White House about alleged election counting issues in Georgia.
Stopped counting: Trump claimed that he “won by a lot … with a lead of over getting close to 300,000 votes on election night in Georgia.” But “a pipe burst in a far away location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours,” saying “a lot of things happened” during that time to steal the election from him.
But the Trump campaign has provided no evidence of fraud. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, a water leak at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, which serves as a ballot processing site, caused a several hours delay in vote-counting on election night. No ballots were damaged, and vote processing resumed normally.
In a Nov. 21 opinion piece for the Washington Post, Raffensperger described the state’s election process he oversaw as “secure, reliable and efficient,” dismissing criticism of it as “unfair and unwarranted.”
Post-election votes: Trump claimed that votes were “coming in after Election Day” in Georgia. But there is no evidence to support his claim.
The Trump campaign and the Georgia Republican Party filed a lawsuit that included an affidavit from a Republican poll observer who expressed concern that 53 ballots may have been received in Chatham County after the 7 p.m. deadline on Election Day but intermingled with on-time ballots. Superior Court Judge James Bass dismissed the lawsuit, stating: “[T]he Court finds that there is no evidence that the ballots referenced in the petition were received after 7:00 p.m. on election day, thereby making those ballots invalid.”
Election observers: Trump also claimed — without evidence — that his campaign had been “denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia.” David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, specifically claimed that GOP observers were denied proper access in Fulton County, where Atlanta is located. 
But in a press conference on Nov. 6, Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, said that while there have been allegations in other states about monitors not being allowed to watch the counts, “In Georgia, this process is and will remain open and transparent to monitors.”

Perdue-Ossoff Race
A Perdue TV ad misleadingly claimed that Ossoff would “defund police” and provide “voting rights for illegal immigrants.” 
Ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police. And while he supports providing a pathway to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants currently in the country illegally, he does not support voting rights for noncitizens.
An Ossoff TV ad offered similar side-by-side comments from Perdue and Trump that the ad contends show Perdue “ignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.”
We’ll leave it to readers to decide for themselves if Perdue’s comments did that, but some of the comments highlighted in the ad came early in the year at a time when medical experts were making similar comments. And Perdue made other comments warning about the seriousness of the virus and reinforcing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to reduce the spread of the virus.
See “Opening Ads in the Perdue-Ossoff Runoff” for more.

Ossoff’s production company received payments from a Hong Kong media company and Al Jazeera for the rights to air investigative pieces, but a Republican TV ad misleadingly claimed Ossoff got cash from “Chinese communists and terrorist sympathizers.”
See “Twisting the Facts on ‘Dirty Money’ in the Georgia Race” for more.

A Republican TV ad falsely suggested that “liberal megadonors” are spending $1 billion in “dark money” to help Ossoff in the runoff race. That’s how much multiple experts estimate may be spent on all candidates in both Georgia Senate elections for the entire 2020 campaign.
See “A Misleading Dark Money Attack on Ossoff” for more.

An ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee misleadingly says Jon Ossoff “praised” the Green New Deal, a proposal that Ossoff has repeatedly said that he does not support. 
See “NRSC’s Dual Attack on Warnock and Ossoff” for more.

Loeffler-Warnock Race
An ad from Warnock claimed that Loeffler “immediately” began “dumping stocks” after a January Senate briefing about the coronavirus. But his campaign provided no evidence she made that investment decision. Loeffler has said her family’s investments are managed by third-party advisers without her input. Also, the Senate’s ethics panel investigated allegations that Loeffler may have violated federal laws or Senate rules against insider trading and found no evidence that she had. 
A Loeffler ad claimed that Warnock “hosted a rally for Communist dictator Fidel Castro” in 1995. But her campaign has provided no evidence that Warnock, who was a youth pastor for a Harlem-based church at the time, was involved in inviting Cuba’s former dictator to speak at that church more than two decades ago.
Loeffler’s ad also said Warnock “called police thugs and gangsters,” leaving out that his comments were specific to the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Brown, a young Black man who was shot and killed in 2014 by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. His campaign said he wasn’t referring to all officers.
See “Loeffler-Warnock Runoff Starts with Attack Ads” for more.

A conservative group’s deceptive TV ad suggested that Warnock supports defunding the police. He has said multiple times that he doesn’t.
See “Ad Links Warnock to ‘Defunding the Police’” for more.

An NRSC ad says Warnock “supports cashless bail for criminals,” which “puts the most violent right back into our neighborhoods.” Warnock’s campaign has said that he “supports ending cash bail for nonviolent misdemeanor offenders, not an all out ban on cash bail.”
In 2018, for example, Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, supported an ordinance approved by the Atlanta City Council that eliminated the requirement for individuals charged with committing certain low-level crimes to pay a cash bond to secure their pretrial release from custody.

50,"Trump Wrongly Blames Protests, Mexico for COVID-19 Spread",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/trump-wrongly-blames-protests-mexico-for-covid-19-spread/,,"Experts say there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter protests or Mexicans have caused the spike in coronavirus cases in pockets of the U.S., contradicting President Donald Trump’s assertions.
In a press briefing on July 21, Trump acknowledged cases were rising in some parts of the country and, “It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.” In another press briefing the following day, Trump noted that cases are rising in parts of the South and Southwest and the West. Trump offered this assessment of the reasons why:
Trump, July 22: There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations — which you know very well about — which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places — maybe beaches — four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide — likely also contributed.
We’re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the president, and it’s a big problem for Mexico. But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Despite Trump mentioning the protests that followed the death of George Floyd and cases rising in Mexico, experts told us there is no evidence either of those is responsible for the spike in cases around the country. Rather, they said, it is a result of some states reopening too quickly or aggressively, without proper measures in place to test, trace and isolate cases, and people generally socializing in ways that epidemiologists had warned would result in the spread of the virus.
Protests
Many epidemiologists feared that the protests in honor of Floyd — a Black man who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25  — would trigger a jump in coronavirus cases.
Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us in a phone interview that he was concerned about large groups of protesters in close quarters screaming and chanting, and in some cases hit with tear gas that would make them cough — things that can contribute to virus spread. But the feared spike in infections never panned out, he said. 
“There has been no evidence that protests led to a significant increase in infections,” Adalja said.
While there have been some cases that have emerged among law enforcement in particular, he said, “It hasn’t been very big.” Any increase, he said, “has been minimal, at best.”
“It really hasn’t had a significant impact on the increases we’re seeing in certain states,” he said.
Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch concurs.
“To my knowledge there is no evidence that the spike in cases can be attributed to protests,” Lipsitch told us via email. “While I and other epidemiologists have noted the likelihood that some transmissions would likely occur at protests, my understanding is that when testing facilities were opened for those who had been at large gatherings, positivity was very low or even zero among those who came — probably because the protests were outdoors and largely masked.”
In a June working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists concluded there was “no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset.” The paper, which is not peer-reviewed, further concluded “predictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.”
The researchers said their analysis of 315 U.S. cities provided “strong evidence” that as a result of protests, non-protesters generally stayed home more, resulting in a net benefit with regard to spread of the coronavirus.
“Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non-protesters’ behavior was substantially affected by urban protests,” the authors wrote. “This effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence.”
Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center, told us via email he was “not aware of evidence that outdoors protests have fueled COVID outbreaks to a significant degree.”
Mexico
Nor did the experts we contacted believe there is any validity to Trump’s assertion that Mexico has contributed to the rise of cases in the U.S.
“The role of Mexican migrants is utterly without foundation, and surely can’t explain upsurges in the Southeast, Northern California, and many other parts of the country,” Lipsitch told us.
On March 21, Mexico and the U.S. jointly restricted nonessential land travel between the two countries to prevent spread of the coronavirus. Nonessential travel includes travel that is considered tourism or recreation. At least one Mexican state completely closed its border with the U.S. ahead of the July 4 holiday, fearing spread of the virus from the U.S. into Mexico.
Statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show that apprehensions of people crossing the Mexican border illegally into the U.S. have been relatively low in the first half of 2020 compared with 2019.
Trump suggested that a rise in coronavirus cases in the Southwest may be due, in part, to the U.S. sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico — where he said cases are “surging.” But Adalja said that is likely “mere coincidence,” considering that states like Florida, Delaware and some in the Midwest are not border states, and yet have also seen spikes in coronavirus infections.
“I don’t think there’s any evidence that Mexico has anything to do with case increases and hospitalization increases in those areas [along the border],” Adalja said. “There’s no evidence of that.”
“It is possible that some infected people may cross borders, but that could probably work in both directions,” Goodman told us. “Again, I’m not aware it is a significant contributor to the U.S. upswing which has generally correlated with relaxation of social distancing.”
Causes Trump Didn’t Mention
Several of the things mentioned by Trump were contributors to the spike in coronavirus cases around the country, experts said, such as people ignoring social distancing recommendations and gathering in bars, and people traveling more for vacation.
The main reason for the spike is fairly obvious, Adalja told us.
“The virus never went anywhere,” he said. When the stay-at-home orders were lifted, it was inevitable that there would be spread.
People began to interact. They went to bars. They gathered at events, often not wearing masks.
The increase was predictable, he said, especially since some states had not prepared the necessary infrastructure to do proper testing, tracing and isolation to control outbreaks.
“What has consistently been clear is that the most stringent control measures have been in the Northeast and these have been the states with the best control over case and death numbers; government policies and individual decisions about reopening and not masking are clearly the main causes of upsurges in the U.S.,” Lipsitch said.
Not mentioned by Trump is the belief among many scientists — including some on the president’s own task force — that some states opened too quickly and aggressively.
“Yeah, then there are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a FiveThirtyEight podcast on July 9.
Fauci also attributed the spike to a general attitude among some U.S. residents, “You know, well, I’m either going to be locked down or I’m going to let it all rip.”
In a press gaggle on July 22, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said “some of these states blew through our gated criteria, blew through our phases, and they opened up some of the industries a little too quickly, like bars.”
Conway then engaged in revisionist history when she added, “So remember, the governors wanted complete latitude over when they would open their states. They pushed back heavily, handsomely, Republicans and Democrats, when it was falsely rumored that the president was going to be in charge of opening the states. He’s a federalist. He believes in states’ rights.”
In fact, Trump was a strong cheerleader for reopening, and repeatedly — and wrongly — claimed that he, not governors, had the ultimate authority to open up states.
In April, Trump admonished Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for opening “too soon.” But he also chastised states with Democratic governors who he thought were being too strict, calling via Twitter to “LIBERATE” Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia.
He has also praised the reopening efforts by some Republican governors, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who he said has done a “fantastic job” responding to the coronavirus, even as Fauci singled out Florida for “jump[ing] over a couple of checkpoints” and opening too quickly. On July 23, Florida broke its record for the highest single-day death toll.
The U.S. has now had 4 million people test positive for COVID-19 – including 1 million in the last 15 days, as the COVID Tracking Project data shows. For the second straight day, the U.S. recorded more than 1,100 daily deaths, on July 22 and 23, and now has had more than 143,000 total deaths.
Epidemiologists say there are a number of reasons for the recent spike in cases around the country, but there is no evidence that Black Lives Matter protests and a surge of cases in Mexico have been major contributors.

Trump suggested that a rise in coronavirus cases in the Southwest may be due, in part, to the U.S. sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico — where he said cases are “surging.” But Adalja said that is likely “mere coincidence,” considering that states like Florida, Delaware and some in the Midwest are not border states, and yet have also seen spikes in coronavirus infections. In a press briefing on July 21, Trump acknowledged cases were rising in some parts of the country and, “It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.” In another press briefing the following day, Trump noted that cases are rising in parts of the South and Southwest and the West. “Yeah, then there are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a FiveThirtyEight podcast on July 9."
51,"Video Airs False, Misleading Claims About Face Masks",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-video-airs-false-misleading-claims-about-face-masks/,,"Evidence of the efficacy of face masks to help control the spread of the novel coronavirus has grown since the start of the pandemic. But a Facebook video, viewed tens of thousands of times, uses false and misleading claims to tell viewers that masks are “unsafe” and “ineffective.”
A Missouri-based chiropractor — who has been previously warned by federal officials to stop spreading misleading content regarding unproven COVID-19 treatments — is now wrongly telling Facebook users that face masks have been proven “unsafe” and “ineffective.”
In a Feb. 11 video live-streamed on Facebook and viewed more than 70,000 times, Eric Nepute rattles off a list of 20 arguments against wearing face masks — claiming, for example, that they cause cavities and “facial deformities” and increase the chances of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
But many of Nepute’s claims are false, misleading or unsupported. And a central takeaway — that masks are “ineffective” — is rebuffed by recent evidence to the contrary.

Two doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently summarized the growing evidence that masks can help to control community spread of the virus. In a piece for the Journal of the American Medical Association, they wrote: “Compelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, especially as source control to prevent spread from infected persons, but also as protection to reduce wearers’ exposure to infection.”
Rather than cite credible research on masks, Nepute largely adapted his claims from a January post on the website of the Canada-based Centre for Research on Globalization. That website has pushed conspiracy theories about the 9/11 terrorist attacks and other topics; a recent State Department report said the website “has been a steady source of anti-U.S. and anti-Western disinformation and propaganda ever since” its 2001 debut.
For his part, Nepute has spread unsound advice before, drawing the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC in May sent a letter warning Nepute that he was unlawfully advertising products and services — including chiropractic care and intravenous vitamin therapy — to treat or prevent COVID-19. The letter advised him to “immediately cease making all such claims.”
Update, April 28: The FTC and Department of Justice announced on April 15 that the government had charged Nepute with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act “by deceptively marketing products containing vitamin D and zinc as scientifically proven to treat or prevent COVID-19.” It was the first civil complaint alleging violations of the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, which was part of an appropriations package signed into law in December.
Throughout Nepute’s 24-minute video about masks, he repeatedly urges viewers to visit his website for vitamins while presenting the faulty claims about face masks — and later, COVID-19 vaccines and more.
Here, we’ll fact-check a few of the claims in the video. 

Misleading Cavities Assertion
Nepute begins: “Reason no. 1 — this is wild right here. Cavities. I didn’t even know this was a thing until I started digging into it about a week or so ago. New York dentists are reporting that half their patients are suffering from decaying teeth at a higher rate in 2021 and 2020 than they had been before, due to — and this is Dr. Rob Raimondi — he told Fox News that just a week ago, that people are getting cavities from wearing a mask.”
The underlying story from the Centre for Research on Globalization that is being used by Nepute refers to an interview that Raimondi, a dentist in New York, did with the New York Post in August, which was republished on the Fox News website. Raimondi told the Post that his practice was seeing people with gum inflammation and “cavities in people who have never had them before … about 50% of our patients are being impacted by this.”
But the American Dental Association told us in a statement that “[t]o date, we have seen no evidence of an increase in cavities in the last year, or that wearing a mask affects your risk of cavities.”
Dr. Patricia Corby, associate dean of translational research in the department of oral medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, similarly told us in an email that “there is no rationale why wearing a mask would increase decay or periodontal disease. Also, no research has been done to prove otherwise.”
What Raimondi and a colleague told the Post, more specifically, was that wearing a mask can increase mouth dryness, since people may breathe more through their mouth when wearing a mask, which can lead to bacteria building up. But they didn’t advocate against wearing masks.
Raimondi in a subsequent Instagram post about the interview said, “We absolutely support mask wearing.” He recommended some ideas for avoiding dry mouth.
The American Dental Association likewise told us that “excessive breathing through your mouth, whether you are wearing a mask or not, may increase development of dry mouth, which increases the risk of cavities. Saliva helps to keep the mouth moist and remineralize tooth enamel which helps fight decay. Even when wearing a mask, it is best to breathe through your nose. Another good way to decrease the risk of cavities is to drink fluoridated water. This can help to avoid dry mouth as the fluoride in the water will help prevent tooth decay.”
Corby said COVID-19 could have affected individuals’ dental and oral health in another way: The pandemic prompted dental clinics around the world to shut down — and some practices to close completely. Even when some could reopen, she said, the pace was slow and some patients were hesitant to visit the dentist.
Unsupported Claim on ‘Facial Deformities’
“No. 2: Facial deformities. Masking children triggers mouth breathing, which has been shown to cause narrowing of the face, narrowing of the mouth, high vaults in the palate, dental malocclusions — and the list goes on and on,” Nepute tells his viewers. “This is according to the Journal of General Dentistry. They say you shouldn’t wear one.”
He’s referring to the Academy of General Dentistry’s journal, General Dentistry, which did not say not to wear a mask. The report being referenced didn’t evaluate masks at all.
Instead, the 2009 report looked at the implications of mouth breathing in children.
Dr. Callan White, a dentist and national spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry, told us by phone that the video’s claim requires “several jumps.” There is no scientific evidence showing that children resort to exclusively breathing through their mouth while wearing a mask, he said, and that they do so for long enough to mirror children who experience chronic mouth breathing.
“Children who suffer from these conditions aren’t able to breathe through their nose at all, or very little, at all times. This condition creates the most harmful effects at night while the child is sleeping,” he told us in an email. “There is a significant difference in frequency and duration of the habit” of mouth breathing due to wearing a mask.
“With this said, remind children to breathe through their nose while wearing a mask, make sure the mask properly fits the child, take mask breaks when possible, and clean/disinfect cloth masks frequently (discard disposable masks as directed by manufacturer),” he added.
Distorted Claim on Risks
Nepute also misleadingly claims that face masks are associated with an “increased risk of COVID-19.”
“What, wait a minute, I thought I was wearing a mask to stop the spread of COVID-19?” he says. “Just like when they told me that I’m getting a vaccine to stop the spread, that doesn’t do it either.” (We’ll address his factual distortions about vaccines later in this story.) He then cites “public health officials of Ontario” to claim that “mask use by the general public could be associated with the … theoretical elevated (risk) of COVID-19.”
That’s a reference to a September document issued by Public Health Ontario that described what the agency knew about the use of masks to control the spread of the coronavirus — including the benefits, which Nepute fails to mention.
Instead, Nepute homes in on only one part of the document, which says: “Mask use by the general public could be associated with a theoretical elevated risk of COVID-19 through decreased physical distancing and self-contamination.”
But those, again, are theoretical risks — and ones that can be mitigated if other steps are taken while wearing masks.
The first theoretical risk is that people wearing masks may not maintain physical distancing. But that’s why health officials have continued to advise that masks should be worn in addition to, not in place of, distancing.
And the second theoretical risk Nepute is citing, of self-contamination, “refers to evidence that shows the frequency of face-touching behaviour in general,” Public Health Ontario told us in an email.
The agency said “the point about the ‘theoretical elevated risk’ is taken out of context.”
“If the outside of a mask is contaminated, there would be a theoretical risk that touching the mask then touching your face could result in exposure to virus … the mitigation for that is frequent hand hygiene,” PHO told us. “PHO continues to monitor and review the emerging evidence on non-medical masks and COVID-19.”
The agency further noted that the same document being cited also said on its first page that “the evidence shows that public mask-wearing is likely beneficial as source control and mandatory public mask policies have been associated with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases compared to regions without such policies.”
Baseless Claim About Bacterial Pneumonia
“Bacterial pneumonia is on the rise,” Nepute says. “We’ve seen a ton of that in our practices. We’ve seen so much respiratory bacterial infections it’s not even funny, especially among children.”
He adds: “In Oklahoma press conference, Dr. James Meehan indeed testified, reporting coming from all of his colleagues are showing, across the world, increase in bacterial pneumonia.”
Nepute is referencing an ophthalmologist who was speaking out against a mask mandate in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in August. Meehan claimed (at 4:40) that “reports coming from my colleagues all over the world are suggesting that bacterial pneumonias are on the rise.” He went to say he believed “untrained members of the public are wearing medical masks repeatedly, in a non-sterile fashion.”
It’s true that experts do not recommend that medical masks that are meant to be worn once be reused.
But we found no evidence to suggest that cases of bacterial pneumonia are on the rise — or that masks are causing such a trend. And experts have debunked different iterations of the same claim before.
For example, Dr. Catharine Paules, an assistant professor at Penn State who specializes in infectious diseases, has said “there is no data” to support the claim that masks trap in bacteria and fungus and make people more susceptible to bacterial or fungal pneumonia.
And our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters debunked a viral falsehood in September that mask-wearers were “arriving in ICU with antibiotic resistant strains of pneumonia from breathing in the pathogenic organisms they were meant to exhale.”
Nepute goes on to wrongly claim that “oh, by the way, that’s the No. 1 thing that killed everybody during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Not the virus, but the bacterial infections. These masks are causing this.”
That’s inaccurate, too.
In 2008, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — including the institute’s director, Dr. Anthony Fauci — published a study that found that most deaths from the 1918 flu pandemic likely resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia after contracting the flu.
“The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,” the National Institutes of Health said in a release explaining the study.
So to suggest the flu wasn’t involved in those deaths is wrong. Furthermore, that study made no mention of masks.


Assessing the Impact of Vitamin D
After trying to discredit masks and erroneously suggesting vaccines are ineffective, Nepute asks, “Why are you not doing the things that do work?” and turns his attention to vitamin D. He later pitches an offer for a “patriot pack” of vitamins that includes vitamin D3 and zinc.
Nepute shows a Healthline story from October, headlined: “New Study Found 80% of COVID-19 Patients Were Vitamin D Deficient.”
“That’s why you should be taking vitamin D every day,” he says. “This is like the 100th study that’s shown vitamin D helps with this.”
He’s overstating things.
We addressed this topic several months ago and explained that, while vitamin D might be helpful in terms of COVID-19, there isn’t enough scientific evidence yet to know whether it can treat or prevent the disease. Research is ongoing.
That said, health experts do advise getting enough vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle, regardless. Most of a person’s vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight.

The Healthline story was about a study published in October in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism that evaluated the vitamin D levels of 216 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It found that the hospitalized patients had lower levels of vitamin D compared with a group in the general population — although it didn’t identify a relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe disease among those patients.
While suggestive, the study doesn’t prove that vitamin D was a factor in whether those patients fell ill or that taking vitamin D supplements would have helped, as it was not a randomized controlled trial.

Vaccine, Testing Claims


Nepute again returns to the topic of COVID-19 vaccines, asking: “What do you mean it works?” He goes on to add: “Effective in what? It does not stop the spread of the virus. You understand that, right?”
First of all, the main point of the vaccines is to prevent those who contract the novel coronavirus from becoming seriously ill with the COVID-19 disease. And in that regard, they are highly effective. For more information, see our SciCheck story “Q&A on COVID-19 Vaccines.”
As for Nepute’s suggestion that vaccines won’t stop the spread of the virus, as we’ve explained before, it’s currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission. But there’s a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.
Nepute also shows viewers the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, scrolling through entries and saying, for example: “Here’s what happened, this person had this done — it was the Pfizer vaccine — they died. This person had abdominal pain, it was life-threatening.”
But as we’ve explained before, anyone can report to that system through an online form, and there is no vetting of the reports. And there is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale. Many have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, but serious side effects are uncommon, according to the CDC.
The CDC notes that reports of death to VAERS following vaccination “do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the death” and that it “follows up on any report of death to request additional information and learn more about what occurred and to determine whether the death was a result of the vaccine or unrelated.”
It adds: “To date, VAERS has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate a safety problem with COVID-19 vaccines.”
About 20 minutes into his video, Nepute also claims that COVID-19 cases have dropped “because they’ve already changed the testing.”
“That happened on Inauguration Day, the World Health Organization said, stop the PCR testing, start switching to antibody testing,” he claims.
That’s false. As we’ve previously explained, the WHO’s notice on Jan. 20 was a memo to lab professionals about the proper use of PCR tests. It was distorted on social media, with dubious websites wrongly claiming the guidance represented a massive change in testing protocol.",Angelo Fichera,2021-02-17 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"We’ve seen so much respiratory bacterial infections it’s not even funny, especially among children.”
He adds: “In Oklahoma press conference, Dr. James Meehan indeed testified, reporting coming from all of his colleagues are showing, across the world, increase in bacterial pneumonia.”
Nepute is referencing an ophthalmologist who was speaking out against a mask mandate in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in August. “With this said, remind children to breathe through their nose while wearing a mask, make sure the mask properly fits the child, take mask breaks when possible, and clean/disinfect cloth masks frequently (discard disposable masks as directed by manufacturer),” he added.

52,Trump Distorts WHO’s Lockdown Comments,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-distorts-whos-lockdown-comments/,,"At campaign rallies and in tweets, President Donald Trump falsely said the World Health Organization changed its position and “admitted that Donald Trump was right” about lockdowns. But the agency has said no such thing.
The president first made the inaccurate claim in a tweet just before the start of an Oct. 12 rally in Sanford, Florida.

The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2020

At the rally, Trump echoed that sentiment after stating that former Vice President Joe Biden would institute a lockdown if elected president.
Trump, Oct. 12: Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate Florida’s economy with the draconian unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. …
But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago and they admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states where they’re locked out, sealed up, suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, death by so many different forms. 
We’ve previously explained that Biden said in an Aug. 21 interview with ABC News that he would shut down the country if that’s what scientists advised. He has since emphasized that he doesn’t think a lockdown would be necessary.
A day after the Florida rally, Trump repeated the claim in a tweet attacking National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci — who has pushed back against a Trump television ad that Fauci said took his words “out of context.”
“WHO no longer likes Lockdowns – just came out against. Trump was right,” he wrote. “We saved 2,000,000 USA lives!!!”
In another rally that night in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the president again said that the WHO “said Trump was right” and boasted about having saved 2 million lives.
The Trump campaign told us that the president was referencing statements recently made by WHO officials and directed us to two news articles highlighting comments by Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, and David Nabarro, one of the WHO’s special envoys on COVID-19.
In one of the articles cited by the campaign, Ryan was quoted as saying this during an Oct. 9 press briefing: “What we want to try and avoid — and sometimes it’s unavoidable, we accept that, but what we want to try and avoid are these massive lockdowns that are so punishing to communities, to societies and everything else.”
Nabarro’s remarks came from an Oct. 8 interview with the British magazine The Spectator. While Nabarro spoke at length, news outlets focused on his plea to world leaders to “stop using lockdown as your primary control method.”
But Trump’s description of their remarks is inaccurate and incomplete. Neither man mentioned Trump or the U.S., and the WHO told us that its position on lockdowns has not changed — it has never recommended them as the primary strategy to control the virus, but recognizes that in some cases they may be needed.
Trump also incorrectly suggested that “Democrat-run states” are currently in lockdown, when no state is shut down the way many were in the spring.
Confusingly, Trump simultaneously claimed that 2 million American lives were saved — a dubious estimate — even though the stay-at-home orders most states issued this spring likely limited the number of COVID-19 deaths.
WHO’s Position on Lockdowns
While Trump’s takeaway from Ryan and Nabarro’s comments was that the WHO was reversing itself, that’s an inaccurate interpretation.
“WHO has never advocated for national lockdowns as a primary means for controlling the virus. Dr Nabarro was repeating our advice to governments to ‘do it all,’” the agency’s press office told us in an email.
“Governments, employers, communities should apply a package of proven public health measures that we know are effective for preventing transmission, including hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, mask wearing, staying home if you’re sick, etc. as well as having robust systems for testing, isolating, tracing and quarantining, etc.,” the statement continued. “Measures to control COVID-19 depend on local risk assessments. Movement restrictions may be among a range of measures that governments can consider in certain geographical areas.”
“If clusters and outbreaks do appear, they should be slowed and then suppressed promptly and that is why localised and targeted movement restrictions, implemented jointly by local actors and national authorities, are needed from time to time,” the press office added.
Nabarro’s statements in the interview are entirely consistent with that assessment. He explained that the WHO backed a “middle way” strategy involving a robust testing, contact tracing and isolation system, along with getting the public on board with physical distancing, wearing masks and other similar measures.
“If we can combine those various steps, what we call ‘doing it all,’ in our organization’s speak, then we can get on top of it,” he said, noting that that is exactly what many East Asian countries have done, along with Germany and parts of Canada.
“We think lockdowns only serve one purpose, and that is to give you a bit of breathing space to stop everything,” Nabarro said. “The virus stops moving, and while you’ve got that breathing space, you should really be building up your testing, building up your contact tracing, building up your local organization.”
Later, he emphasized that point again, saying, “We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted.”
In an Oct. 13 Twitter thread, the agency also iterated its position, noting that lockdowns were not ideal, but might be necessary.
“We understand that sometimes such measures – although not sustainable – are needed to swiftly suppress the virus and avoid health systems being overwhelmed,” the WHO said. “Lockdowns are not sustainable solutions because of their significant economic, social & broader health impacts. However, during the #COVID19 pandemic there’ve been times when restrictions were necessary and there may be other times in the future.”
States Aren’t in ‘Lockdown’
Related to Trump’s claim about the WHO is the idea that certain states — namely, Democratic states — are in lockdown and should reopen. But that’s a straw man argument, as no state is still under a highly restrictive stay-at-home order. 
According to a New York Times tracker, many states still have some kind of restriction in place, such as closures or capacity limits on certain businesses, most commonly restaurants and bars or entertainment venues and cinemas that are at higher risk for spreading the virus.
These limits, however, are quite different from the more stringent orders 42 states and territories implemented in March through May, which frequently involved closing all nonessential businesses and required people to stay at home unless they were out for an essential activity.
Previously, the president has inaccurately said that Michigan is “closed,” as we’ve written, even though the governor lifted the state’s stay-at-home order on June 1.
As for New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced new temporary restrictions for specific hotspot areas on Oct. 6, but this doesn’t mean the entire state is under a lockdown. Only six portions of five counties, which are concentrated in the New York City area, are affected.
In the worst-off areas in New York, identified as “red zones,” only essential businesses can remain open; dining is limited to takeout only; in-person schools are closed; and there’s a capacity limit for houses of worship.
The targeted approach, which the state developed with public health experts, is consistent with the WHO’s advice to keep movement restrictions localized. 
Two Million ‘Saved’ Lives
At the same time Trump is disparaging lockdowns in his tweets and rallies, he also mentions that 2 million American lives were saved — an odd feature to highlight, since state-issued stay-at-home orders likely helped avoid COVID-19 deaths.
“We saved 2 million lives,” Trump said during his Johnstown rally. “They said 2.2 million people, we saved 2 million lives and you know we get nothing.”
As of Oct. 14, more than 216,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker — although the true death toll is almost certainly higher.
We’ve explained before that an early model from Imperial College London projected in March that the U.S. could lose 2.2 million people to the pandemic. But that high death toll assumed no mitigation measures were used at all — and that people also wouldn’t modify their behavior.
In other words, it’s not necessarily a realistic benchmark against which to measure the administration’s success. 
Research does support the idea that lockdowns — which were instituted by states, not Trump — saved lives earlier this year, although it’s hard to say how many. 
A paper published in the journal Nature concluded that lockdowns prevented some 60 million infections in the U.S., but didn’t venture a guess as to how many deaths were averted.
Similarly, Columbia University researchers estimated that if the U.S. had implemented social distancing one week earlier in March, 36,000 fewer people would have died.",Jessica McDonald,2020-10-14 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“The virus stops moving, and while you’ve got that breathing space, you should really be building up your testing, building up your contact tracing, building up your local organization.”
Later, he emphasized that point again, saying, “We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of control of this virus. “Governments, employers, communities should apply a package of proven public health measures that we know are effective for preventing transmission, including hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing, mask wearing, staying home if you’re sick, etc. “If we can combine those various steps, what we call ‘doing it all,’ in our organization’s speak, then we can get on top of it,” he said, noting that that is exactly what many East Asian countries have done, along with Germany and parts of Canada.

53,Trump’s Faulty Testing Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-faulty-testing-claims/,,"President Donald Trump and coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said the United States had done more testing for COVID-19 infections in eight days than South Korea had done in eight weeks, but that ignores the fact that South Korea has a much smaller population. On a per-capita basis, the U.S. lags behind the Asian country, and other nations.
We also found the raw numbers show the U.S. testing totals for the eight-day period were still a bit lower, but close, to South Korea’s eight-week figures.
In addition, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. test is “better” or “the best test,” but there is no evidence to support that.
South Korea and the Importance of Testing
South Korea has been held up as a relative success story in containing the coronavirus outbreak, due in part to an extensive, and early, testing program. The daily growth in new cases dropped off considerably in early March after spiking in late February. In other words, South Korea, so far, appears to have begun flattening the curve, which is the much-talked-about goal of social distancing efforts in the United States.
Both countries reported their first confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the same time, on Jan. 20 and 21. But South Korea ramped up its testing program sooner, and, therefore, was able to identify and isolate cases early in the pandemic. Testing a higher proportion of the population has given the country a greater capacity to control the total spread of the disease.
Around Feb. 19, South Korea first began reporting daily spikes in confirmed cases, while the U.S. was a few weeks behind that. The curve of confirmed cases for the U.S. is still on the rise, as the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine interactive tracking map of the worldwide outbreak shows.

As Science magazine wrote on March 17, while many countries, including several in Europe, had shown “dire trends” in rising case counts and deaths from COVID-19, “South Korea has emerged as a sign of hope and a model to emulate.” The country has received praise for its testing program, while the U.S. government has faced criticism for a slow testing rollout and a lack of sufficient numbers of test kits.
(South Korea also has undertaken substantial efforts to isolate infected individuals and trace their contacts with others, including by publicly releasing information on those individuals’ recent movements, which has raised privacy concerns.)
Kim Woo-Joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University, told Science magazine that the country’s experience with a 2015 MERS outbreak “showed that laboratory testing is essential to control an emerging infectious disease.”
The director-general of the World Health Organization highlighted the efforts of South Korea in a statement on March 18, saying the WHO was working with other countries “to apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere.”
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under the Trump administration, also has pointed to South Korea as a model. On Twitter on March 12 he said the U.S. “probably lost chance to have an outcome like South Korea,” and wrote of the importance of “aggressive screening to get people diagnosed.” The U.S., Gottlieb said, was “far behind current caseloads” with too many people not being able to get tested. “So we can’t identify clusters and isolate disease.”
As we’ve explained before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a manufacturing problem with its test kit early in February when it shipped those kits to state and local public health labs.
In the March 24 coronavirus task force briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke about the importance of testing in helping the U.S. understand how pervasive the disease is and to contain it.
For areas of the country that don’t yet show large numbers of cases, “they still have a window of significant degree of being able to contain,” Fauci said. “In other words, when you test, you find somebody, you isolate them, you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing.”
With a large outbreak already underway, he said, “it’s tough to do anything but mitigation.” But with more testing, “you’re going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we’re going, particularly because we have the ability to test.”
The U.S. Versus South Korea, By the Numbers
The Trump administration has now claimed a milestone of sorts, compared with South Korea.
In a March 24 virtual town hall that was aired on Fox News, Birx said that the U.S. by that day “will have done more tests than South Korea did in eight weeks in the last eight days.” She acknowledged, “We have to do more.”
Trump repeated the claim later in the town hall, and both cited it again in the coronavirus task force briefing that day.
Trump, March 24 coronavirus task force briefing: You know, one of the things that’s — that’s happened — that we’ve done, I think, a really good job on — I think that it’s something special what’s happened is I learned from Dr. Birx, a little while ago, when she said — I learned it actually this afternoon: In eight days — because we kept hearing about South Korea. And they had a very tough time at the beginning, if you remember. In eight days, we’re doing more testing than they’ve done in eight weeks. That’s a tremendous turn.
Birx gave some specific figures. “We now have 370,000 tests that have been done. The majority of those — over 220,000 in the last eight days, which, those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days,” she said.
According to figures provided by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, South Korea had conducted 348,582 tests as of March 24 (including some that were pending). Beginning Jan. 31, about eight weeks earlier, testing using a diagnostic that could detect the virus within six hours had been conducted at government public health institute locations, and it was distributed to other health facilities on Feb. 7, according to the Korean CDC.
The U.S. CDC hasn’t released up-to-date figures on testing, which can take a number of days for results, according to LabCorp, one of the commercial labs conducting testing in the United States. Data provided by the COVID Tracking Project, which is run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, shows higher figures for the U.S. than Birx cited: 317,347 tests completed or pending in the U.S. over the eight-day period of March 17 to 24. That’s less than South Korea’s roughly eight-week figure, but it’s close.
More important, South Korea’s population is 51.8 million; the U.S. population is 329.4 million. So, on a per-capita basis, the U.S. is still far behind.
South Korea has tested 0.7% of its population, or about 1 test for every 149 residents over that eight-week period. The United States has tested about 0.1% of its population, or 1 test for about every 1,038 residents over the eight-day period.
Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us that in order to cover a larger percentage of the population, which is what South Korea is trying to do, the U.S. would need to conduct more tests per capita. “[S]imply pointing to total number of tests run without paying attention to the denominator of total population coverage, is misleading,” he said in an email. 
To match South Korea’s testing rate, the U.S. would have needed to conduct about 2.3 million tests. The COVID Tracking Project shows a total of 433,545 tests completed or pending in the U.S. as of March 25. It’s feasible for the U.S. to match South Korea’s testing rate over several weeks, given the fact that the tracking project’s figures show about 50,000 to 70,000 tests being completed per day over the past few days.
“The percentage of people tested in the US is much, much lower than South Korea,” Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us. 
Nuzzo noted a different testing philosophy between the two countries. The U.S. is reporting nearly 70,000 confirmed cases (as of March 26), but “this is likely a large underestimate of the actual number of cases, as most of the testing done to-date is limited to patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized. Conversely, South Korea, which has only reported fewer than 10,000 cases is testing widely — not just limiting tests to hospitalized cases.”
In the March 25 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump repeated the claim about South Korea and said: “We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We’re testing more than anybody right now. There’s nobody even close.”
But there are other countries that have done more tests on a per-capita basis than the United States, in addition to South Korea.
A chart compiled by Our World in Data, from official country reports, shows the U.S. lagging behind several countries on a per-capita testing basis as of March 20. And the U.S. hasn’t yet caught up to some of those countries. For instance, Australia had tested 4,473.4 people per million inhabitants as of March 20, while the latest figures for the U.S., which include five extra days, show a rate of 1,316 tests per million people, as of March 25.
Other countries that outpace the U.S. testing per capita include the United Arab Emirates, Germany and Austria, according to figures as of no later than March 20.
Similarly, testing data compiled by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, shows Italy had conducted 5,199 tests per million people, as of March 25; Switzerland had conducted 9,519 tests per million people, and the United Kingdom was just above the U.S. in per-capita terms, with 1,375 tests per million.
No Evidence U.S. Tests Are ‘Best’
Trump also has claimed in the past few days, without evidence, that the U.S. has “the best tests,” asserting they are “the most accurate tests,” “better” than South Korea’s and that this “makes a big difference.”
Sampath, whose organization is testing COVID-19 tests from various manufacturers to provide independent verification for countries, told us there’s “no data that would support” the president’s claim, and “no reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)” than those being run in other countries.
We asked the White House for support for the president’s claim, and we haven’t received a response.
Sampath told us in a phone interview that “98% of all of the tests being done are molecular tests,” and those are “comparable” no matter where they are run.
He said at some point there will be data available to make comparative evaluations, but right now it “doesn’t exist.”
Update, April 3: Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. has done more tests “than any other country anywhere in the world,” and he went even further on April 2, making the false claim that this was the case “both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most.” Despite having conducted more than 1 million tests, the U.S. is still behind Germany, Italy and South Korea on a per-capita basis.
A chart by Our World in Data shows those three countries had conducted significantly more tests per-million people than the United States as of April 1. The chart notes: “There are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units, whether or not all labs are included, the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects.”",Lori Robertson,2020-03-26 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"No Evidence U.S. Tests Are ‘Best’

54,Viral Posts Misrepresent CDC Announcement on COVID-19 PCR Test,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-viral-posts-misrepresent-cdc-announcement-on-covid-19-pcr-test/,,"
Scientists consider polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests a highly reliable tool for diagnosing COVID-19. But social media posts are misrepresenting a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement regarding the eventual discontinuation of its own test, falsely claiming the government has conceded that PCR tests aren’t reliable.
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed and deployed its own polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test to identify infections with the novel coronavirus (although its initial rollout was beset with some issues).
A year and a half later, the federal agency has notified labs that it will — at the end of 2021 — withdraw its emergency use authorization request for the test to the Food and Drug Administration, thereby discontinuing its use.
The agency in a July 21 notice recommended that labs use “one of the many FDA-authorized alternatives” and said it “encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.” Such multiplex tests, including one from the CDC, can look for both the novel coronavirus and multiple types of influenza at the same time — which conserves testing materials and allows public health labs to do influenza surveillance while testing for SARS-CoV-2, or the virus that causes COVID-19.
But the CDC did not say it was no longer supporting the use of PCR tests in general, many of which have been authorized by the FDA — or that its original PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 can’t tell the difference between coronavirus and influenza — as viral posts spreading online falsely claim.

“After 180 million positive cases, the CDC have announced their withdrawal statement from using the PCR test to detect Covid, due to its lack of detection to differentiate between Covid and Influenza,” read a July 25 tweet screenshot posted to Instagram. The post received more than 4,000 likes.
A July 26 Facebook post similarly claimed: “Big News-CDC withdraws PCR test from FDA EUA. It’s inability to differentiate Covid from Influenza was #1 reason.”
The CDC’s PCR test in question looks only for SARS-CoV-2, not influenza — which is quite different from a test that mistakenly diagnoses influenza cases as COVID-19, as the posts erroneously suggest.
Other posts have falsely claimed it was the FDA that made the purported revelation about the CDC’s PCR test, or PCR tests in general.
A since-deleted July 23 tweet from “UK Medical Freedom” falsely claimed that the “FDA announced today that the CDC PCR test for COVID-19 has failed its full review. Emergency Use Authorization has been REVOKED.”
Two days later, on July 25, a controversial gym owner in New Jersey, Ian Smith, falsely claimed in a viral tweet that the “FDA confirms PCR tests not accurate for testing COVID.” He referred to COVID-19 as a “Manufactured crisis.”
As we said, the announcement in question came from the CDC and was about plans for the eventual discontinuation of its own test. It is still in use currently. The FDA did not revoke the CDC test’s emergency use authorization or question the reliability of PCR tests, an FDA spokesman confirmed to us.
Scientists consider PCR tests a reliable and highly specific diagnostic tool, as we’ve explained before, but distortions about them have persisted amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
In explaining the CDC’s decision to end the use of its own PCR test at the end of 2021, Kristen Nordlund, an agency spokeswoman, in an email to us cited “the availability of commercial options for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including multiplexed (discussed here) and high-throughput options” — referring to technologies that use an automated process to administer hundreds of tests per day.
“Although the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel met an important unmet need when it was developed and deployed and has not demonstrated any performance issues, the demand for this test has declined with the emergence of other higher-throughput and multiplexed assays,” Nordlund said.
She continued: “CDC is encouraging public health laboratories (PHL) to adopt the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay to enable continued surveillance for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which will save both time and resources for PHL.”
The FDA’s website lists a multitude of PCR tests for COVID-19 that have been issued emergency use authorizations.
Jim McKinney, an FDA spokesman, told us in an email that to date, “the FDA has authorized more than 380 tests and sample collection kits to diagnose COVID-19, many of which are PCR tests. PCR tests are generally considered to be the ‘gold standard’ for COVID-19 diagnosis.”
“The FDA has not issued any statement questioning the reliability of PCR test results in general and will continue to consider authorization for validated PCR tests,” he added.
Dr. Michael Mina, a Harvard University assistant professor of epidemiology, told us that the CDC’s decision regarding its test made sense, given how the landscape has changed.
“CDC is likely going to pull its own EUA for its test because hundreds of other labs now have their own EUAs and CDC no longer even needs to use its own test since many companies now have EUAs for manufactured tests,” he said in an email. “The major Companies like Roche, Hologic, Abbott all have their own test kits and instruments. Then the ThermoFishers of the world have EUAs for their PCR kits that can be run in the exact same way as the CDC assay. So there really is no reason for CDC to retain their EUA.”
Mina said the move had to be done carefully, since some public health labs may currently be relying on the CDC’s test.
“At the end of the day, the CDC EUA was more or less a recipe for how to test for CoVID, and a couple ingredients,” Mina said. “Now we have all these kits and fully automated processes so it’s no longer needed.”",Angelo Fichera,2021-07-26 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Emergency Use Authorization has been REVOKED.”

55,Video Questioning Vaccine Efficacy Pushes Falsehood About Israel Data,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-video-questioning-vaccine-efficacy-pushes-falsehood-about-israel-data/,,"
The COVID-19 death rate for unvaccinated people has been significantly higher than for vaccinated people in both Israel and the U.S. Despite that, conservative commentator Ben Swann makes the false claim in a video that Israeli data prove vaccines aren’t effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. But the charts he uses don’t distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.

As COVID-19 vaccines became more widely available in the U.S. after they were introduced in December 2020, daily deaths from the disease fell from a high of 4,094 on Jan. 13 to a low of 120 on July 11, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The number of daily deaths then started rising again as the delta variant became dominant in July, reaching a high of 2,398 on Sept. 24.
Unvaccinated individuals died at a much higher rate; they had an 11 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19 in August than fully vaccinated people, according to data compiled by the CDC.
“This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in July.
But Ben Swann — who has peddled dubious claims and conspiracy theories, including the falsehood that COVID-19 vaccines may include a tracking device in a microchip — recently posted a video claiming that the vaccines have been ineffective.
“The reality is, is that the numbers for COVID deaths, the numbers for COVID hospitalizations, the number of sick people, the transmission rate — none of it has changed as a result of these vaccines,” he said. “The only thing that’s changed is the bottom line for big pharma.”
To support his claim, Swann cited data from Israel — which had a successful vaccination program early on, vaccinating more than half its population by April. Almost 62% of the country’s total population is currently fully vaccinated. In the U.S., about 58% of the total population is fully vaccinated.
“So if you take a look at what’s been happening there,” Swann said in the video, referring to Israel, “you can get kind of a stronger idea of what is working and not working with the COVID-19 vaccines. And one of the things that we’re now finding is that the lie that’s been told for some time, that COVID-19 vaccines will prevent you from getting a serious case or even hospitalizations or deaths – actually, it’s not true. Statistically, the numbers are pretty much the same as they were before the vaccine was even introduced.”
He then shows a series of charts purporting to show “Deaths Per Hospitalisation,” “COVID Test Positivity Rate,” and “Hospitalisations/Positive Test Rate.” The charts all show an uptick at the end. But there are a few problems with how he presents the data.

First, Swann’s charts are from a Sept. 22 blog post when the delta surge was peaking. But when Swann’s video went up more than a month later on Oct. 27, COVID-19 daily rates of deaths, hospitalizations and cases in the U.S. and Israel had fallen significantly.
Second, neither the original post nor Swann’s video mentions the delta variant, which is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus that causes COVID-19 and led to the spike in cases that began over the summer, when attitudes toward mitigation measures like social distancing and mask wearing had relaxed.
And third — and most important — the charts don’t distinguish between deaths among vaccinated versus unvaccinated patients. In Israel, as in the U.S., the rates of those who have died or been severely ill from COVID-19 since the delta surge began have been higher among the unvaccinated compared with the vaccinated, according to data from the Israel Ministry of Health.

So Swann’s support for his claim doesn’t hold up.
As we said, the delta surge peaked in September. For example, the number of COVID-19 deaths during the delta surge peaked at 37 on Sept. 6, but had dropped to six on the day Swann released his video, according to data from the Israel Ministry of Health. As of Nov. 8, the number of daily deaths in Israel had fallen to three.
A chart from Our World in Data, a project run by the British nonprofit Global Change Data Lab and the ​Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development​ at the University of Oxford, shows that death rates per 1 million population from COVID-19 decreased as vaccination rates increased, until the delta variant became prevalent in July.

But again, as we said, it’s important to note that the death rate for those who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated was higher than it was for those who were fully vaccinated in both the U.S. and Israel during the delta surge. For example, on Sept. 6, the day Israel’s delta surge peaked, Ministry of Health data show that patients over the age of 60 died at a rate of 13.6 per 100,000 people if they were unvaccinated, 10.8 if they were partially vaccinated, and 0.1 if they were fully vaccinated. For those under 60, the rates were 0.1 for unvaccinated patients and zero for partially and fully vaccinated patients.

In the U.S., the CDC’s data on vaccination status and death aren’t available for the full month of September, but they show that through August, unvaccinated people had a risk of dying that was 11.3 times greater than fully vaccinated people. (See the CDC chart at right).
As we’ve explained before, the raw numbers of hospitalizations and deaths aren’t good indicators of whether vaccines are effective.
“Epidemiologists never look at raw number of cases if we want to think about anything causal, because they don’t tell us what we want to know. We need to know the denominator too,” Matthew Fox, professor in the Departments of Epidemiology and Global Health at Boston University, told us for a story we published last week on social media posts misinterpreting data from the U.K. Fox said the death rates for vaccinated and unvaccinated people are the better measure, though there are other factors in those populations that can affect the statistics.
It’s also worth repeating what we’ve explained before — all of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. are highly effective at preventing symptomatic disease. Clinical trials for all three vaccines showed that they were effective, and studies since then have demonstrated that they are effective in real-world conditions. They’ve also been shown to be effective against the delta variant, although they are less effective in preventing infection and mild disease compared with earlier versions of the virus.
Most studies show the vaccines remain highly effective in preventing serious disease, hospitalization and death from delta, and ongoing monitoring by the CDC shows that the vaccines are more than 80% effective in preventing hospitalization.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-11-10 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"For example, on Sept. 6, the day Israel’s delta surge peaked, Ministry of Health data show that patients over the age of 60 died at a rate of 13.6 per 100,000 people if they were unvaccinated, 10.8 if they were partially vaccinated, and 0.1 if they were fully vaccinated. “The reality is, is that the numbers for COVID deaths, the numbers for COVID hospitalizations, the number of sick people, the transmission rate — none of it has changed as a result of these vaccines,” he said.

56,FactChecking Trump’s Weekend Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/factchecking-trumps-weekend-claims/,,"On Sept. 26 and 27, President Donald Trump spoke for about two hours and 15 minutes in five appearances — including one campaign rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania. We’ve compiled many of the president’s false and misleading claims from those remarks.
By contrast, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spoke for less than 45 minutes in a few appearances. We wrote about Biden’s claims in “FactChecking Biden’s SCOTUS Speech and Repeats.”
We examined the two candidates’ weekend remarks in the run-up to the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.
On Saturday, Sept. 26, Trump made remarks in announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee for the Supreme Court, before departing the White House on Marine One and at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. On Sunday, Sept. 27, the president did an interview with Fox News and held a press confererence.
We’ve written about most of these claims before.
Distorting the Facts on Biden’s Positions
Biden’s health plan. Trump inaccurately suggested Biden supported a Medicare for All health plan. Biden has been clear in his opposition to the idea, pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, as the Democratic debates showed.
“The Biden plan would … destroy protections for preexisting conditions. You know that. They want to go socialized medicine,” Trump said. “Get rid of 180 million private plans that people love.”
Biden’s health plan calls for keeping and building on the Affordable Care Act, creating “a public health insurance option like Medicare” that people could choose to buy, expanding the tax credits under the ACA and offering a premium-free plan for those in non-Medicaid-expansion states who otherwise would have qualified for the program under the ACA.
Killing Osama bin Laden. Trump misleadingly claimed Biden “opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden.” As we have written, Biden said only that he wanted further confirmation that bin Laden was actually present at the compound in Pakistan.
School choice/charter schools. Trump wrongly claimed that Biden “wants to ban school choice and ban charter schools.” 
As we have written, Biden opposes federal funding going to “for-profit charter schools,” but schools managed by for-profit companies make up only a fraction of charter schools — about 10%, according to a researcher for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition — the ultimate in school choice for some — he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools.
Biden and guns. Trump said, “Biden wants to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in schools, right?” As we have written, it is not true that Biden favors confiscating weapons, and there is no evidence Biden wants to indoctrinate children with “poisonous anti-American lies.”
After Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke — a proponent of mandatory buybacks of assault weapons — endorsed Biden in March, misinformation about Biden’s position on guns began to circulate. Videos and articles suggested Biden would be confiscating weapons should he make it to the White House. But that was unfounded, as we have written. While Biden did say O’Rourke would help him with gun policy, he never adopted the mandatory buyback approach.
Biden’s gun safety proposals include banning the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a voluntary program to buy back assault weapons and high-capacity magazines from those who now possess them. Under Biden’s plan, assault weapons owners could either sell the weapons to the government or register them under the National Firearms Act.
Fracking. In Pennsylvania, the nation’s second-largest natural gas producer, Trump claimed that “Joe Biden has vowed to ban fracking,” which Biden recently said emphatically he would not do. In the past, Biden has incorrectly explained his climate change plan, which calls for only “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters.” 
In a July 2019 Democratic primary debate, for example, Biden said, “we would make sure it’s eliminated,” when he was asked if there would be a place for “fossil fuels, including coal and fracking” in a Biden administration. But Biden’s campaign later clarified that he meant that he supports ending federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and transitioning, by 2050, to a clean energy economy with net-zero emissions. 
His plan allows for existing fracking permits to continue on federal lands and does nothing to prohibit fracking in non-federal areas — where most crude oil and natural gas is produced.
“I am not banning fracking,” Biden said last month, at an Aug. 31 campaign rally in Pittsburgh. “Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking — no matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me.”
Health care access. Trump falsely claimed, “Biden is pledging to give federal health care to illegal aliens, which is decimating Medicare.” Biden has made no such promise. 
Biden has said that, unlike current law, his plan would allow those individuals living in the U.S. illegally to “buy into the system,” referring to the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges. 
A unity task force made up of supporters of Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also “recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, [and] allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces.”
Refugees. Trump repeated his criticism of Biden for proposing to “increase refugee admission 700%.” That is close to correct — largely because Trump, in a break from past administrations, sharply lowered the cap on refugees to just 18,000 in fiscal year 2020, which began on Oct. 1, 2019. 
Biden says on his campaign website that he will “set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000,” which is a 600% increase from 18,000. It is also 56% higher than President George W. Bush’s last fiscal year, and 14% higher than what President Barack Obama had authorized in his final fiscal year.
Election Ballots, Polls and Interference
Ballots found in “river.” As part of his campaign against mail-in ballots, Trump misleadingly claimed “many ballots” were found “in a riverbed.”
According to the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Office in Wisconsin, three trays of mail were found Sept. 21 along the side of a road and in a ditch next to a highway in Greenville. Officials there said the batch of mail included “several” absentee ballots, though a Postal Service spokesman would not comment on whether those were completed ballots, or blank ones being sent to voters, according to the Post Crescent. The paper quoted the county clerking saying election officials started to mail out ballots to voters on Sept. 17.
Double ballots. Trump also wrongly said before departing the White House on Sept. 26 that there was “another case where a thousand ballots were sent, but not single — they were sent double, so you get to vote twice.” He said that “thousands of ballots sent to people and they’re double ballots, where you get two votes.”
As NBC4 in Washington reported, election officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, believe up to 1,000 people who requested mail-in ballots may have gotten two by mistake. But those people won’t be able to vote twice. Fairfax County Registrar Gary Scott said that when every ballot is returned, “we make an entry into their voter record that they have returned a ballot. So if something else shows up, the ballot has already been returned. We can’t count that ballot.”
General election polls. Prior to leaving for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the president said, “We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Florida. I think we’re leading everywhere.” He is trailing by nearly five points in Pennsylvania, according to polling averages by Real Clear Politics and Five Thirty Eight. It is a virtual tie in Florida, with Biden holding a slight advantage in the averages computed by both websites. It’s safe to say both states are very much in play for either candidate.
On soliciting Russian interference. Trump said that he was only joking when he said, “Russia, if you’re listening, find her [Hillary Clinton’s] emails.” According to Trump, when he delivered the line, “we all laughed together” and “the whole place cracks up along with me.” He blamed the media for creating the controversy, saying they “cut off my last word.”
We’ll let readers decide for themselves Trump’s intent, but Trump did not laugh when he delivered the line at a press conference at his resort in Doral, Florida, in July 2016, nor did the assembled media. Watch for yourself.
On or about that same day, Russian military intelligence officers attempted “to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton’s personal office,” according to the July 13, 2018, indictment filed against 12 Russian military intelligence officers for waging cyberattacks on the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. 
COVID-19
Fatality rate decline. Repeating a line he’s now delivered more than a dozen times, Trump said at his Pennsylvania rally, “We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April.” 
As we’ve written, he’s right that the U.S.’s reported case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths from the coronavirus among diagnosed cases, has fallen dramatically since April. But Trump’s suggestion that that’s entirely due to treatment improvements — and advances Americans or the American government developed — is misleading.
To date, only one drug — the steroid dexamethasone — has demonstrated a mortality benefit for COVID-19 patients. That finding came from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the U.K. 
Because the case fatality rate is highly dependent on the number of identified cases, experts say part, if not most, of the decline can be explained by increased testing, along with a shift in the types of people who are infected with the coronavirus. In the pandemic’s early months, testing was often limited to people with symptoms and older, higher-risk patients made up more of the cases. Over the summer, testing became more widely available and diagnoses became more common in younger people.
Excess mortality. The president said that “Europe has had almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States,” echoing earlier claims about excess mortality, but using an even higher percentage. Available data show that it’s the U.S., not Europe, that has a higher excess mortality rate. Excess mortality is an alternative metric that avoids issues of miscounting or underreporting COVID-19 deaths, and instead uses the actual number of deaths, regardless of cause, relative to a “normal” or expected number of deaths during a given time period.
Our previous analyses, which have used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and EuroMOMO, a group monitoring mortality trends in Europe, along with the Human Mortality Database, have not borne out any of Trump’s past percentages.
Updated figures from these sources again fail to back Trump’s revised claim. The CDC’s latest estimate, which covers deaths between Feb. 1 and Sept. 12, ranges from 208,390 to 274,055 excess deaths, with a middle estimate of 241,222 excess deaths. That’s versus 211,025 excess deaths through week 38, or Sept. 20, for 24 European countries or parts of countries, according to EuroMOMO. When adjusted for population, the U.S. has had 730 excess deaths per million people, which is 6% more than the EuroMOMO region’s 686 excess deaths per million.
The Human Mortality Database figures, which include more of Europe, show that up until June 28 (the most recent data for the largest number of countries), Europe’s excess mortality is 9.9% above normal, versus 13.8% for the U.S. And when limited to countries that have data through week 35, or Aug. 30 — the latest date for the U.S. — America’s excess mortality rate is also higher: 14.5% compared with 12.5% for that subset of Europe.
Strategic National Stockpile “cupboards” weren’t “bare.” As he has before, Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration left the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies “bare.” “We did a job, including ventilators that nobody had,” the president said during the Pennsylvania rally. “The cupboards were bare when we took over.“ 
While some news reports note that some personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirator masks, were not replenished after 2009’s H1N1 influenza pandemic, the stockpile was not empty. In 2016, a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said there were at least six warehouses of items worth approximately $7 billion. The president’s boast about ventilators also rings hollow. As we’ve written, Trump actually inherited more ventilators in the stockpile — nearly 17,000 — than were distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Saving lives. At his rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Trump said of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, “We had to close it down. We saved millions of lives.” As we have written, we don’t know for sure whether Trump is on target when he says that the lockdowns — which were imposed by many states, not by Trump — may have saved “millions” of lives. Also, Trump at times pressured states to open up before their governors wanted to.
An early model from Imperial College London projected in March that the U.S. could lose 2.2 million people to the pandemic, but only if no mitigation measures whatsoever were taken to combat the virus.
An unpublished study released in June by a group of economists estimated “mitigating public health measures” would save between 913,762 and 2,046,322 lives in the U.S. At the same time, they estimated that “the economic downturn from shelter-in-place measures and other restrictions on economic activity could create an indirect collateral loss of 84,000 to 514,800 lives over the following years.”
A study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley published on June 8 in the journal Nature found that lockdowns had prevented 60 million infections in the United States. The study didn’t say how many lives were saved, but the lead researcher, Solomon Hsiang, did say the benefits of the lockdown are in a sense invisible because they reflect “infections that never occurred and deaths that did not happen.”
A study by researchers at the Imperial College London estimated lockdowns saved about 3.1 million lives in 11 European countries. Columbia University researchers concluded that 36,000 fewer deaths from the coronavirus would have occurred if the U.S. had imposed social distancing one week earlier in March.
Popular Talking Points
Not the “greatest economy.” As he frequently does, Trump falsely said at the rally that the United States had had “the greatest economy in the history of the world” before the novel coronavirus hit. As we have written, that was not the case. The real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product grew 2.2% in 2019  — down from 3% in 2018. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 3% a total of 17 times.
Trump also said, “We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months.” He failed to mention that is fewer than half of the 22.2 million jobs the country had lost earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Auto plants. Trump repeated false claims about auto plants in Michigan, telling the rally crowd in Pennsylvania: “What I’ve done for Michigan, in particular, also Pennsylvania, but what I’ve done for them with autos, forget it. They’re building 17, or expanding 17, different plants. They hadn’t built one in 42 years and we’re building a lot of them.”
The last vehicle assembly plant built in Michigan before Trump took office was a General Motors plant in Lansing Delta Township, completed in 2006. As for the country at large, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz both announced new plants in 2015 in South Carolina.
Despite Trump’s boasts, the number of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs in Michigan has gone down under Trump, even before the coronavirus pandemic caused economic shutdowns. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced in February 2019 it would convert two plants into a new assembly site in Michigan, and Honda and General Motors announced shortly after his inauguration a joint venture to produce hydrogen fuel cell systems in an existing GM facility. But there have been three plant closures announced in the state since Trump took office.
Oil and natural gas. Trump took credit for milestones reached long before his presidency when he claimed: “We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.” The U.S. became the leader in production of petroleum in 2013 and natural gas in 2009, as we’ve written before.
Nobel Peace Prize. At the rally, Trump complained that the media had ignored his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump said: “I got nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes. … And I said, ‘They didn’t cover two Nobel prizes.’ I got two in one week. … But the fake news never even put it on. And somebody had a show where they said the amount of time devoted to Donald Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize, two of them, zero on the network, zero.”
As we have written, Trump makes a number of false statements when he discusses his nomination. Trump conflates being nominated, as he was, with actually winning, as his predecessor, Barack Obama, did. Trump hasn’t won one. Simply being nominated is not a huge deal: This year 211 individuals and 107 organizations have been nominated. And he wasn’t nominated for two: While he was nominated by two people, there is just one Nobel Peace Prize. 
Border wall and open borders. As he often does, Trump talked about the progress his administration has made on building his long-promised wall on the border between the United States and Mexico, a major Trump campaign promise during 2016. “And we are just finishing a beautiful wall,” he said. “That wall 340 miles, 340.  … Now we’re up to 330 miles.” According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 341 miles of wall and fencing have been erected. But as we have reported, most of that is replacement of existing fencing or wall; there has been little new construction. The San Antonio Express-News reported on Aug. 7 that only five miles of new wall have been built.
Trump also said, “By contrast, Joe Biden supports open borders.” As we have reported, that is not the case. There’s no doubt Biden supports a more open and welcoming immigration policy than the one championed by Trump. But that’s not the same as advocating open borders. “I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is happening,” Biden said in an interview on Aug. 5.
Quelling urban unrest. Trump falsely took credit for sending the National Guard into Minneapolis to put down violent protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. “You saw what we did in Minneapolis,” he said. “She called us like a week and a half too late. We went in. How long did that take? About a half hour. It was over. We brought in the National Guard. We told Seattle we’re coming in and they left that night.”
Trump is wrong about the National Guard in both cases. In Minneapolis, as we have written, after a second day of demonstrations got out of hand, Mayor Jacob Frey officially declared a local emergency and called for the state’s National Guard to be deployed. Minnesota’s governor Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the state’s National Guard following day. Similarly, in Seattle, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee activated the guard at the request of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan after protests turned violent.
Low–income housing in the suburbs. Trump said that he had “knocked out” an Obama-era regulation regarding low-income housing in the suburbs. “I knocked out the regulation that allows low-income housing in the suburbs,” he said. “They’re changing the zoning so they can build. That’s what it is. They’re changing the zoning. It was a rule, a regulation that was a disaster.” As we have written, on other occasions Trump has said the regulation “required” building low-income housing in suburbia.
As we said in our story, it’s unclear whether the rule had any impact at all, as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson suspended its requirements in 2018. Experts on regulatory processes and community development told us HUD’s 2015 final rule on “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” did not mandate either low-income housing or rezoning. In its published rule, HUD said of the regulation: “This rule does not impose any land use decisions or zoning laws on any local government.”
Islamic State. Trump again took too much credit for recapturing Islamic State-held land. “In just three and a half years, we’ve … obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate,” he said. Before Trump took office, about half of the territory held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had been regained under his predecessor, Barack Obama. That’s according to figures provided by Trump’s own administration.
The rest of the land was retaken under Trump. In March 2019, the Syrian Democratic Forces announced that the final stronghold in eastern Syria had been retaken.
Obama’s unfilled judicial vacancies. Trump again wrongly claimed that President Barack Obama left the Trump administration “over 100″ federal judicial court vacancies — it was precisely 112 — “because he probably thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win. And, you know, in which case it wouldn’t have mattered too much. I guess that’s what he assumed.”
As we have written, the number of judicial vacancies left by Obama was historically high, but that wasn’t because Obama didn’t try to fill most of them. Rather, it was resistance to Obama’s judicial nominations from Senate Republicans who took over a majority during the last two years of Obama’s presidency. In early January 2017, just before Trump took office, there were 59 federal court nominees pending.
Ukraine
Ukraine prosecutor. At his rally and in a White House briefing, Trump repeated the false narrative about “Joe’s involvement” in the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in 2015. Trump falsely accused the former vice president of withholding $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine “until such time as they let go of a prosecutor that was investigating the company that his son was involved with,” referring to Hunter Biden’s work as a board member for the Ukraine gas company Burisma. 
As we have written, the Obama administration joined the international community and anti-corruption advocates in Ukraine in calling for the prosecutor to be removed from office for his failure to aggressively prosecute corruption. A Republican-led Senate committee investigation recently found no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president.
Schiff and Trump’s Ukraine phone call. Trump criticized Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, for giving his own dramatic crime-novel representation of what happened in the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “Shifty Schiff, he gets up and says a totally different thing than what I said, totally different. They say, ‘Sir, you can’t go after him because he’s shielded because he made this speech.’ He totally lied,” Trump said. 
A day after the White House released a memo of the July phone call, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and Biden’s son, Hunter, Schiff gave his own rendition at the start of a congressional hearing, saying this was “the essence of what the president communicates” in his call “in not so many words.” Later in the hearing, Schiff said the summary “was meant to be at least part in parody.”
So, it’s true Schiff admittedly gave an account that was different than the memo — and in some respects inaccurate, as we’ve said. But it wasn’t “totally different”: Other parts of Schiff’s comments were similar to the memo of the phone call.

57,Video: Trump Twists Fauci’s Words,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/video-trump-twists-faucis-words/,,"In this video, we show how President Donald Trump misquoted Dr. Anthony Fauci’s remarks in late February about the threat that the novel coronavirus posed for Americans.

At the White House on April 28, Trump — in defense of his early response to the coronavirus pandemic — falsely claimed that in late February, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had said, “This is no problem. This is going to blow over.”
In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci was asked if Americans should “be changing our habits.” He responded by describing the risk “right now at this moment” as “low,” so there was “no need” for people “to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis.” But he added that “this could change,” that people needed to be wary of “community spread,” and that it could develop into a “major outbreak.”
Trump repeated this false claim in a Fox News virtual town hall on May 3. “Everybody, even Tony Fauci was saying, ‘It’s going to pass, not gonna be a big deal,'” Trump said at the town hall.
As of the morning of May 4, the U.S. had more than 1.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 67,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.

58,Trump’s Inaccurate COVID-19 Death Rate Comparison,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-inaccurate-covid-19-death-rate-comparison/,,"Available data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths contradicts President Donald Trump’s recent claim that “the United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.”
As of April 16, there were at least 90 countries with a lower case fatality rate than the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Trump made his claim about global coronavirus mortality rates during an April 16 press briefing by the White House coronavirus task force. At the same briefing, the president said a “team of experts now agrees” that the U.S. can begin the process of reopening businesses that have largely been shut down during the pandemic.
Trump, April 16: The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.
Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we’re calling, “Opening Up America Again.”  And that’s what we’re doing: We’re opening up our country. And we have to do that. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.
We asked the White House what information the president relied on, but we did not receive a response.
He’s wrong based on recent data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world.
The university has calculated the “observed case-fatality ratio” — the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases — for around 130 countries. As of April 16, at least 90 of those nations had a lower rate than the U.S. rate of 4.9%.
Some of those nations with a lower rate were Singapore (0.2%), New Zealand (0.6%), Australia (1%), Israel (1.1%), Japan (2.1%), South Korea (2.2%) Turkey (2.2%), Germany (2.9%), Portugal (3.3%)  and Canada (4.1%).
The data does show the case fatality rate in the U.S. was lower when compared with the other countries that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. had the third lowest rate among the 10 countries Johns Hopkins University said were “most affected by COVID-19 worldwide,” as of April 16. Only China (4%) and Germany had lower rates than the U.S. (and data as of April 17 indicate that China’s rate may now be up to 5.5%). Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Spain all had rates higher than 10%.
It’s important to note that Johns Hopkins University says differences in mortality rates can be caused by a number of reasons such as testing, demographics and health care systems.
“With more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio,” the university said, for example.
Trump himself made this point at a March 29 briefing. 
“It’s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we’ve been testing,” he said. “It’s also one of the reasons that we’re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we’ve been doing more testing.”
The U.S., which is the third most populous country, has conducted more tests than any other nation – about 3.4 million, as of April 16, according to Our World in Data. But it lags behind other countries on a per-capita basis, as we have written before.
We should also point out that these case fatality rates are based on only the known coronavirus cases and deaths. Because unreported cases and deaths are not included, it’s difficult to say exactly what the rate of death from COVID-19 is in any country.  
But based on the global data we currently have about the disease, Trump’s claim that the U.S. mortality rate is lower than nearly all other nations is wrong.
Correction, April 20: We originally said the U.S. had the “eighth lowest rate” among the 10 most affected countries. It had the third lowest rate.

59,Businessman’s Social Media Post Distorts Facts on Definition of a Pandemic,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-businessmans-social-media-post-distorts-facts-on-definition-of-a-pandemic/,,"A businessman’s post on Instagram and Facebook wrongly claims that the U.S. government “changed the definition of pandemic” in 2004, suggesting that COVID-19 would not have qualified under the old definition. There’s no evidence for those claims — and COVID-19 is by all means a pandemic.

More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease has caused a reported 4 million deaths around the world, including more than 600,000 in the United States. But false and misleading claims casting doubt on the seriousness of the disease remain unrelenting.
A businessman with nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram recently took to social media to erroneously claim that the U.S. government previously changed the definition of “pandemic” — and suggest that, under the supposed old definition, COVID-19 would not have been considered a pandemic.
But that’s wrong for several reasons.
Dave Asprey, who founded the coffee and nutrition company Bulletproof, begins the caption of the post by accusing “the media” of creating a “storm about the latest health scare” every “3-4 years,” arguing that diseases are hyped up for financial reasons, including pharmaceutical company profits.
The image with the post includes a timeline of various disease outbreaks since 1986, and is labeled “The pandemic business model” — even though most of the outbreaks included were not declared pandemics. Of the nine infectious disease events referenced, only two were deemed pandemics: COVID-19 and the 2009 H1N1 “swine flu.”

“It’s such a big business that in 2004, US agencies seeking more funding changed the definition of pandemic from ‘rapidly spreading infection that kills a lot of people’ to ‘rapidly spreading infection,'” the caption of the post continues.
The post, which received more than 12,000 likes and was also repeated on Asprey’s Facebook page, goes on to claim, among other things, that “[y]es, the death rate is higher than normal, but nowhere near what would have made the cut before they changed the definition.”
But there’s no evidence to support the claim that “US agencies seeking more funding changed the definition of pandemic.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes a pandemic as an “epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.” (The same page describes an epidemic as “an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area.”)
Similarly, A Dictionary of Epidemiology, as Vox pointed out last year, defines a pandemic as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.”
COVID-19 — with more than 191 million cases reported to date in countries around the world — no doubt meets that general definition of global spread of a disease.
In 2004, the year referenced by Asprey, Congress did pass the Project BioShield Act. The law — intended to help the U.S. prepare against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats — allowed the government to guarantee the purchase of countermeasures (such as vaccines) in order to help facilitate their development. It also permitted the Food and Drug Administration to issue emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, for drugs and medical products during public health emergencies; the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.S. have been given EUAs.
But the law did not proffer — or revise — a definition for “pandemic.” Nor was any definition laid out in the 2006 Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.
While there has been some grappling over the years about the precise definition of pandemic — and how severity of a disease should be considered in declaring one — multiple experts told us they had not heard of the U.S. government changing some official definition of the word for the sake of funding, as Asprey alleges.
Frank Snowden, a professor of history and the history of medicine at Yale University, instead noted to us that there was some debate over a change that the World Health Organization made — in 2009, not 2004 — to a webpage offering a definition for “influenza pandemic.”
That page described an influenza pandemic as occurring “when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity, resulting in epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness.”
In early May 2009, not long before the H1N1 pandemic was declared, the WHO revised that page — removing the reference to a pandemic causing “enormous numbers of deaths and illness.” By May 9, 2009, for example, the same page had been changed to say: “A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic of a disease. An influenza pandemic may occur when a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity.”
That change spoke to the fact that there was not a universally accepted definition of “pandemic,” as a New York Times column documented.
Some criticized the change on the website and argued that H1N1 should not have been labeled a pandemic. But WHO maintained that the change on the website did not affect the H1N1 pandemic declaration, since there were then established phases in place for declaring a pandemic. WHO no longer uses that system.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, co-authored a piece published in October 2009 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases highlighting how there was not a single accepted definition of pandemic.
The authors wrote that there were common traits in previously described pandemics — such as wide geographic extension; disease movement (or “spread via transmission that can be traced from place to place”); and high attack rates and explosiveness (multiple cases occurring in short periods of time).
“There seems to be only 1 invariable common denominator: widespread geographic extension,” they concluded.
In terms of COVID-19, WHO officials were reportedly slow to adopt the word “pandemic.” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in late February 2020 that the decision on whether to declare the disease a pandemic would be based on “an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society.”
On March 11, 2020 — citing the rapid increase in cases of COVID-19, its spread across more than 100 countries, and by then thousands dead — Ghebreyesus said WHO “made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.” Two days later, then-President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency.
We sent questions about Asprey’s claims to his company, but we didn’t hear back.
His suggestion that the COVID-19 death rate is “nowhere near what would have made the cut before they changed the definition” is equally dubious. Even the old description of “influenza pandemic” on the WHO website was vague in including the qualification of “enormous numbers of deaths and illness.” 
It’s hard to know exactly how lethal COVID-19 is, as we’ve explained. As the WHO has written, studies estimate that the infection fatality ratio, or percentage of deaths out of all infections, is between 0.5% and 1%. But the pandemic is ongoing and not all infections have been diagnosed. The case fatality rate, or percentage of deaths out of confirmed cases, was 1.8% in the U.S., as of July 9.
And as we noted earlier, the disease — because it has spread so widely — has caused more than 4 million deaths worldwide.
“No matter what definition you want to use, COVID-19 is a pandemic,” Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, told us in an email.",Angelo Fichera,2021-07-20 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Dave Asprey, who founded the coffee and nutrition company Bulletproof, begins the caption of the post by accusing “the media” of creating a “storm about the latest health scare” every “3-4 years,” arguing that diseases are hyped up for financial reasons, including pharmaceutical company profits. Of the nine infectious disease events referenced, only two were deemed pandemics: COVID-19 and the 2009 H1N1 “swine flu.”

“It’s such a big business that in 2004, US agencies seeking more funding changed the definition of pandemic from ‘rapidly spreading infection that kills a lot of people’ to ‘rapidly spreading infection,'” the caption of the post continues. “No matter what definition you want to use, COVID-19 is a pandemic,” Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, told us in an email. A businessman with nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram recently took to social media to erroneously claim that the U.S. government previously changed the definition of “pandemic” — and suggest that, under the supposed old definition, COVID-19 would not have been considered a pandemic. The law — intended to help the U.S. prepare against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats — allowed the government to guarantee the purchase of countermeasures (such as vaccines) in order to help facilitate their development."
60,Stories Falsely Cite ‘Stanford Study’ to Misinform on Face Masks,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-stories-falsely-cite-stanford-study-to-misinform-on-face-masks/,,"
Stanford Medicine says it “strongly supports the use of face masks to control the spread of COVID-19.” Yet viral stories falsely claim a “Stanford study” showed that face masks are unsafe and ineffective against COVID-19. The paper is a hypothesis, not a study, from someone with no current affiliation with Stanford. Update: The paper was retracted.

Evidence indicating that face masks can help control the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has grown since the virus first emerged, upending life around the world. In March, we outlined the evolving research on the efficacy of face masks and explained why experts support their use.
But a stubborn thread of misinformation falsely claiming that masks do not work, and are actually dangerous, continues to be recycled and shared a year-plus into the pandemic.

Viral headlines in recent days have wrongly purported that a “Stanford Study” proved that masks are ineffective and dangerous. In reality, the paper in question was one author’s hypothesis and didn’t come from anyone currently affiliated with the university.
“Stanford Study Results: Facemasks are Ineffective to Block Transmission of COVID-19 and Actually Can Cause Health Deterioration and Premature Death,” reads an April 19 headline from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website known for spreading misinformation. The story — shared on Facebook nearly 28,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data — cites another website, NOQ report, whose story was published two days earlier.
The American Conservative Movement website similarly ran the headline, “Stanford study quietly published at NIH.gov proves face masks are absolutely worthless against Covid.” It was shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
The paper being referenced was not an original “study,” but one person’s hypothesis — or proposed explanation — based on a review of some previous literature. It was first published online in November by the journal Medical Hypotheses, which describes itself as “a forum for ideas in medicine and related biomedical sciences.” While the paper appears on PubMed Central — an archive of scientific literature run by the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine — that does not indicate NIH endorses or concurs with the content, as some of the viral stories wrongly suggest.
The paper’s author, Baruch Vainshelboim, is listed as being affiliated with the “Cardiology Division, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System/Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States.”
But Julie Greicius, a spokesperson for Stanford Health Care and the university’s School of Medicine, told us in an email that “[t]he author’s affiliation is inaccurately attributed to Stanford, and we have requested a correction” from the author and the journal. 
“The author, Baruch Vainshelboim, had no affiliation with the VA Palo Alto Health System or Stanford at the time of publication and has not had any affiliation since 2016, when his one-year term as a visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper ended,” she said in an email. She also noted that “Stanford Medicine strongly supports the use of face masks to control the spread of COVID-19.”
A spokesperson for VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Michael Hill-Jackson, also told us in an email that “Baruch Vainshelboim does not work for the VA and is incorrectly affiliated on this website.” He said Vainshelboim “served as a postdoc assistant under one of our researchers from 2015-2016, however, he was never officially employed by VA and his time in this role is completely unrelated to this paper.”
So, no, the paper is not a study from Stanford, as the headlines claim. It’s unclear where Vainshelboim currently works or why the paper featured the incorrect affiliation. We sent him several questions but haven’t heard back.
We reached out to the editor of Medical Hypotheses, Mehar Manku, about Vainshelboim’s paper and he said in an email that the journal was aware of “issues related to the publication in question” and that “[a]ctions are in progress.”
Update, May 3: At Manku’s request, Elsevier, publisher of Medical Hypotheses, has retracted Vainshelboim’s paper and apologized to its readers “for difficulties this issue has caused.” The retraction, in part, reads:
The Editorial Committee concluded that the author’s hypothesis is misleading on the following basis:
1. A broader review of existing scientific evidence clearly shows that approved masks with correct certification, and worn in compliance with guidelines, are an effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission.
2. The manuscript misquotes and selectively cites published papers. References #16, 17, 25 and 26 are all misquoted.
3. Table 1. Physiological and Psychological Effects of Wearing Facemask and Their Potential Health Consequences, generated by the author. All data in the table is unverified, and there are several speculative statements.
4. The author submitted that he is currently affiliated to Stanford University, and VA Palo Alto Health Care System. However, both institutions have confirmed that Dr Vainshelboim ended his connection with them in 2016.
In the paper, Vainshelboim lays out a hypothesis against the utility of masks and concludes that they are “ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such [as] SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.” It claims at one point, “Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter (the virus is 1000 times smaller), SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask.”
J. Alex Huffman, an aerosol scientist at the University of Denver, told us in a phone interview that the paper betrayed a fundamental lack of understanding of respiratory aerosols.
“Viruses don’t come out of your mouth as naked viruses,” he said. “They come out in liquid drops that are full of mostly water but also some proteins and salts” — and, if someone is sick, virus.
Huffman further said in an email that “there is a wide distribution of particle sizes emitted when people breathe, speak, sing, or cough, but the range is anywhere from tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns. Most of these, even after evaporation, are easily removed by good masks.”
Indeed, lab studies have shown masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Such studies have limitations, but they continue to suggest that masks — especially ones that are multi-layered and fit well — can play a role in stopping the spread of COVID-19.
For example, one study by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health tested a variety of face coverings for their ability to prevent the outward spread of particles from a simulated cough. N95 respirators performed the best — blocking 99% of the particles — while medical masks blocked 59% and a three-ply cloth mask blocked 51%. (A face shield, on the other hand, stopped just 2%.)
And in another experiment, researchers in Japan evaluated how well different masks on two mannequins that faced one another reduced exposure to the coronavirus. One mannequin was connected to a nebulizer, which produced a simulated cough, “mimicking a virus spreader,” and the other was connected to an artificial ventilator to simulate breathing. If both mannequins wore a cotton or surgical mask, transmission decreased by 60% to 70%.
For more information on the research surrounding face masks, see our SciCheck story “The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.”
Vainshelboim’s paper also claims that masks “restrict breathing, causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.” Hypoxemia is the term for insufficient oxygen in the blood; hypercapnia is the presence of too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. 
Experts have repeatedly rebuffed that claim, and we’ve previously addressed unfounded claims that masks cause unsafe oxygen levels.
“For many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions,” the Mayo Clinic Health System notes. “The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks while in public, and this option is very breathable. There is no risk of hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels, in healthy adults. Carbon dioxide will freely diffuse through your mask as you breathe.”
The American Lung Association also notes: “We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur.” (However, it recommends that people with preexisting lung disease contact a doctor before wearing an N95 respirator.) ",Angelo Fichera,2021-04-22 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"We reached out to the editor of Medical Hypotheses, Mehar Manku, about Vainshelboim’s paper and he said in an email that the journal was aware of “issues related to the publication in question” and that “[a ctions are in progress.”

61,Posts Spread Dubious Claim About Ivermectin and Male Fertility,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/posts-spread-dubious-claim-about-ivermectin-and-male-fertility/,,"The Food and Drug Administration says male infertility is not a known side effect of the antiparasitic medication ivermectin. Dubious claims that the drug sterilizes 85% of male users were incorrectly attributed to a questionable 2011 study of the drug’s effect on a small sample of Nigerian men with onchocerciasis, a tropical disease also known as “river blindness.”
As an increasing number of people in the U.S. have turned to the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to try to prevent or treat COVID-19, social media posts have claimed that the medication — which has not been proven to be effective against the disease — could impact the reproductive health of men.
“TIL Ivermectin apparently sterilizes the majority (85%) of men that take it,” reads a since-deleted Sept. 5 tweet that was turned into an image and shared on Facebook, for example.
Another Facebook post commenting on the drug included a screen capture of the headline of a KTSM-TV story that also has been retracted.
“Ivermectin causes sterilization in 85 percent of men, study finds,” was the heading of that Sept. 8 article.
But that was not the conclusion of the 2011 Nigerian study mentioned in the article or linked to in the tweet.
The introduction section of that study said a different report published in 2002 found that “85% of all male patients treated in a particular centre with ivermectin in the recent past” developed “sperm dysfunctions,” such as low sperm counts and poor sperm motility or movement.
However, the 2011 study didn’t say that the sperm dysfunctions mentioned in the 2002 report meant that those men were suddenly infertile.
“I don’t think the study conclusively provides any evidence to show that ivermectin causes infertility,” Dr. Puneet Masson, director of Male Reproductive Medicine and Surgery at Penn Medicine Urology, told FactCheck.org in an interview.
Ivermectin
Ivermectin, in tablet form, has only been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans to treat certain parasitic worms. A topical formulation has been approved by the FDA for external use against parasites such as head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.
There is also an FDA-approved version of ivermectin to treat certain internal and external parasites in animals. But animal drugs should never be taken by humans, the FDA says.
As for side effects, the FDA does list several that have been associated with ivermectin for people, such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, swelling, dizziness and seizures. But male infertility or sterility is not one of them.
“Infertility in men is not a known side effect of ivermectin and is not included as a side effect in the labeling,” an FDA spokesperson said in an email to FactCheck.org. “The labeling for ivermectin and its bioequivalents states that ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m2/day basis). ”
The FDA’s statement, along with other factors, led the El Paso, Texas-based news station to pull its article.
“FOR THE RECORD: A national story regarding Ivermectin and a study regarding its effect on men’s reproductive health that KTSM published, has been removed from our website,” KTSM investigative reporter Erin Coulehan, the author of the original story, wrote in a Sept. 9 correction. “Concerns over the scientific research methods, the veracity of the original, peer-reviewed report and public statements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) saying that infertility is not a known side effect of Ivermectin all led to our editorial decision to remove the story.”
Despite the retraction — and numerous fact–checking articles casting doubt on the claim — people on social media continue to assert that ivermectin makes men sterile.
The Nigerian Study
The 2011 study was published in the Archives of Applied Science Research, which is purported to be a “peer-reviewed, open-access journal.” A copy of the study is available online via the Scholars Research Library.
The authors tested the effect of ivermectin on the sperm functions of a small number of Nigerian men who were given the drug for 11 months to treat onchocerciasis, a tropical illness also known as river blindness, which is caused by parasitic worms transmitted through repeated bites by blackflies.
While 385 men with the disease were initially screened for the study, only 37 of them — between the ages of 27 and 58 — had normal sperm counts that made them eligible for further testing. The other men with “very low sperm counts” were excluded.
Subsequently, the authors “observed significant reduction in the sperm counts and sperm motility of the patients tested,” but did not “record any significant change or alteration in the sperm viscosity, sperm volume, and sperm liquefaction time of the patients.”
Overall, the authors said, the results indicated the drug could cause infertility in the patients, which led the researchers to “suggest that caution be seriously exercised in the treatment of male onchocerciasis patients with ivermectin to avoid the adverse effects it has on the patients’ sperm functions.”
But Masson, who is also an assistant professor of clinical urology in surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, told us the study had several issues.
His primary concern was the sample size and the health of the patients.
“They threw out basically more than 90% of their study patients that were in their dataset because they had abnormal semen parameters,” he said. “So my question is: Is something but the underlying disease causing people to be infertile?” (The study did not include a control group of patients with the disease who did not receive ivermectin.)
He also said that while the study did show some of the men had a “numerical decline” in their sperm concentration and motility, which are measurements of the amount and movement of the sperm, it wasn’t a “clinically significant” decrease, because the numbers didn’t drop below the “normal values” used for comparison in the study.
That would not make the men infertile, Masson said, noting that the study did not include any actual pregnancy data to suggest that the men had difficulty achieving a pregnancy compared with anybody else.
As we pointed out earlier, the authors of the study did not say ivermectin causes sterility in 85% of men — which is how many promoted their research online. The 85% statistic — which was worded differently — was mentioned in the study’s introduction, but was attributed to another source.
“A recent report showed that 85% of all male patients treated in a particular centre with ivermectin in the recent past who went to the laboratory for routine tests were discovered to have developed various forms, grades and degrees of sperm dysfunctions,” the authors wrote. No other details about the report were provided in the 2011 study.
A footnote indicated that the source was a 2002 paper published in the Journal of Biomedical Investigation, but we could not find it by accessing online databases for journals, or when doing an internet search. The African Journals Online resource has some archived editions of the journal, but only going back to 2003 — when AJOL says the first volume was published.
We tried contacting the authors of the 2011 study for comment on their work — and to obtain a copy of the 2002 report they referenced — but we did not receive a response.
What we do know is that the 10-year-old Nigerian study alone is not evidence that ivermectin makes the vast majority of male users sterile. And without more information about the 2002 report, it’s not possible to say if it supports the claim, either.",D'Angelo Gore,2021-09-23 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"As for side effects, the FDA does list several that have been associated with ivermectin for people, such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, swelling, dizziness and seizures.

62,Trump Campaign Didn’t Send Email Fundraising Off COVID-19 Diagnosis,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-campaign-didnt-send-email-fundraising-off-covid-19-diagnosis/,,"Quick Take
An image spreading on social media purports to show a Trump campaign email asking supporters to “please DONATE to help him recover from” COVID-19. It is not from the campaign, and appears to have been created as a joke.

Full Story 
In the hours after President Donald Trump revealed that he and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for the novel coronavirus, an image began circulating on Twitter that falsely suggested the Trump campaign had sent a fundraising email to supporters to capitalize on the news.
But the viral screenshot of the purported email was not, in fact, a message from the Trump campaign — and appears to have been created as a joke.
Not everyone interpreted it that way.
“[F]undraising off of his diagnosis turns my stomach. Could it be a #Covidhoax2020 ? Who knows,” one Twitter user’s post read, in part.
Another, from the president of the Georgia NAACP, called the supposed email “sinister and insulting.” (He later acknowledged that it was “not a legitimate email” from the campaign.)
The Trump campaign confirmed to FactCheck.org that the image did not show an actual email sent by the campaign.

The bogus email began, “Friend, By now you have heard the news. President Trump and the First Lady has tested positive for the China Virus.”
It later went on to say: “President Trump would like to ask a favor. Will you please DONATE to help him recover from this disease?”
In its fifth paragraph, the email suggested the push was to raise “421 million to ensure our President will recover to serve another 4 years!”
That $421 million is the same figure referenced in a New York Times investigation, which found that Trump “appears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.”

63,COVID-19 Vaccines Don’t Have Patient-Tracking Devices,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/covid-19-vaccines-dont-have-patient-tracking-devices/,,"Quick Take
A video circulating on social media falsely claims that vaccines for COVID-19 have a microchip that “tracks the location of the patient.” The chip, which is not currently in use, would be attached to the end of a plastic vial and provide information only about the vaccine dose. It cannot track people.

Full Story
COVID-19 vaccines have begun rolling out, but so has misinformation about them.
A video claiming that the vials containing the vaccines have a microchip that “tracks the location of the patient” has been viewed more than 225,000 times on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle.
That’s false.
The claim is based on a misrepresentation of an interview with Jay Walker, an executive for a medical device company called ApiJect.
That interview was posted in May on the website for the Christian Broadcasting Network, a nonprofit founded by conservative televangelist Pat Robertson. In the interview, Walker explained that his company had received a federal contract to ramp up production of its prefilled syringes so that they would be available for use in administering either vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.
The ApiJect syringes work like an eyedropper, Walker explained, with a plastic pouch as the vial. The syringes can also be made with an optional chip that could be attached to the end of the plastic vial to store information about its contents. The chip is an RFID tag, which is short for radio frequency identification, and requires a device to scan and read the data.
“What that chip does is it has the unique serial number for each dose,” Walker said in the original interview. “It is designed so that there is no counterfeiting. It is designed so that we’ll know exactly that the right dose hasn’t expired. However, that chip only refers to the dose — there’s no personal information, no patient information. It’s simply like a barcode, only we know instantaneously where and when that dose has been used.”
That portion of the interview wasn’t included in the video that’s currently circulating. Instead, the video includes the falsehood that the chips would be used to track the location of individual patients.
It’s unclear how that would even work, though, since the RFID tag is attached to the vial and can’t be injected into a patient. Steven Hofman, spokesman for ApiJect, told us in an interview that the idea of the RFID tags being used to track individuals is “beyond fantasy.”
In reality, the chip would allow those administering the vaccine to check that the dose hasn’t expired and isn’t counterfeit, Hofman said. “It’s incapable of collecting any personal information,” he said.
Also, it’s worth noting that ApiJect’s syringes aren’t being used for either the currently available vaccine developed by Pfizer and the German biotech company BioNTech or the next one up for emergency use authorization, which was developed by Moderna.
“Neither Moderna or Pfizer are using our syringe at this point,” Hofman said.
Despite the fact that the syringes aren’t currently being used for COVID-19 vaccines and the optional chips they use can’t track individuals, many Facebook users left comments on the video expressing a misunderstanding.
“Nope, never had flu shot, won’t take this either! Especially one with a tracking device. What a crock,” wrote one user.
The misconception that vaccines may be used as a vehicle to implant tracking devices isn’t new, though. At the beginning of the pandemic we wrote about a similar claim that anticipated Bill Gates would use a COVID-19 vaccine to track people with microchips. That was bogus, too.

Could vitamin D help decrease the chance of covid 19?
FULL ANSWER
As the coronavirus has spread around the globe, some scientists have proposed that vitamin D could help with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. 
Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden, for example, published a March 23 column on Fox News’ website suggesting that vitamin D could reduce a person’s COVID-19 risk.
“There are many crackpot claims about miracle cures floating around,” he wrote, “but the science supports the possibility – although not the proof – that Vitamin D may strengthen the immune system, particularly of people whose Vitamin D levels are low.”
The idea stems in part from experiments that have found that the vitamin, which is synthesized in the skin after sun exposure and is found in select foods, is used by the immune system. Some research also suggests vitamin D supplements might protect against respiratory infections, especially if someone is deficient in the vitamin. And many of the people most affected by the coronavirus, such as the elderly and minority populations, tend to have lower vitamin D levels.
But experts caution against overinterpreting preliminary correlations or hypothetical mechanisms. As Pennsylvania State University nutrition researcher A. Catharine Ross told us, associations are not the same as cause and effect, and the evidence either for or against vitamin D and COVID-19 is “extremely weak.”
A rapid review from Oxford University’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found “no clinical evidence” that vitamin D could prevent or treat COVID-19, and another review on the topic published by nearly two dozen nutrition experts in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health recommended avoiding vitamin D deficiency, but warned against taking high doses of the vitamin.
“As a key micronutrient,” the authors wrote, “vitamin D should be given particular focus—not as a ‘magic bullet’ to beat COVID-19, as the scientific evidence base is severely lacking at this time—but rather as part of a healthy lifestyle strategy to ensure that populations are nutritionally in the best possible place.”
Thus, while it’s a good idea to get enough vitamin D — pandemic or not — it’s too early to say that a lack of vitamin D makes COVID-19 worse, or that supplementing with vitamin D provides any protection against the disease. 
Vitamin D Basics
Although called a vitamin, vitamin D acts as a hormone in the body, and is best known for building strong bones, which is done in large part by promoting absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestine.
“It’s actually a prohormone, and of all the nutrients that we have, it’s the only nutrient where the main source is not diet,” said Susan Lanham-New, a vitamin D researcher at the University of Surrey in the U.K.
Instead, she told us, most of a person’s vitamin D is made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, which is why darker-skinned people are more likely to have lower levels of the vitamin, and why people who go outside less frequently, including those who are older or less healthy, are susceptible to deficiencies.
For vitamin D to be used by the body, it must be converted into an active form, typically by the liver and kidney, according to a National Institutes of Health fact sheet. The nutrient is found naturally in only a few foods, such as eggs and oily fish, but is more widely available in the U.S. in food that has been fortified, including milk and cereals.
While there is a debate about exactly how much vitamin D a person needs, and what constitutes a deficiency, Lanham-New said a commonly used metric for deficiency is a blood level below 25-30 nanomoles per liter. Too little vitamin D can lead to rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults — conditions in which bones become soft and deformed. 
More is not always better, however, since vitamin D is fat-soluble, and is stored in the body. “You can get what we call hypercalcemia if you take too much vitamin D,” Lanham-New said, referring to elevated levels of calcium in the blood that can be especially dangerous for those with kidney diseases.
Vitamin D and Immunity
Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D is also known to function in the immune system, which is a key reason why some think it’s plausible the nutrient might impact COVID-19.
Lanham-New, for example, said that vitamin D receptors are present on immune cells, and some immune cells make enzymes that help convert the nutrient into an active form.
“That very much provides the scientific rationale for the potential role of vitamin D in maintaining” the immune system, she said.
Some experiments in cultured cells have shown that vitamin D can trigger the production of antimicrobial peptides, including in lung cells, that might act to fight off invading pathogens.
Other lab experiments have found vitamin D might act to tamp down overactive immune responses by tilting those responses toward less inflammatory ones, including by reducing the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, or signaling proteins. 
Some researchers have hypothesized that this mechanism might be relevant to the coronavirus, since some COVID-19 patients experience life-threatening surges of cytokines known as cytokine storms that can damage organs as immune cells rush into the lungs to clear the virus from the body.
But while a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice. Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent.
There is some evidence that vitamin D can protect against respiratory tract infections. In 2017, researchers at Queen Mary University of London published a meta-analysis in the journal BMJ that pooled individual patient data from 25 randomized controlled trials testing vitamin D supplementation in a variety of illnesses, including influenza, pneumonia, colds and ear infections. 
The authors identified a protective effect for those taking vitamin D supplements daily or weekly, with the greatest benefit going to those who had the lowest levels of the vitamin to start. Periodic large doses, or boluses, of vitamin D were not effective.
An accompanying editorial, however, noted that the absolute risk of coming down with at least one respiratory infection when taking vitamin D supplements dropped by only 2 percentage points — from 42% to 40% — and that given differences between the studies that were analyzed, large randomized controlled trials were still needed.
Lack of Evidence for Vitamin D and COVID-19
Because the coronavirus is so new, little rigorous research has been done specifically on vitamin D and COVID-19.
Oxford’s rapid review, which was posted last month and reflected literature searches performed in April, did not identify any clinical evidence that vitamin D is beneficial for COVID-19. The report concluded that “well-masked randomized trials” were needed before specifically recommending the nutrient for COVID-19, but that Britons should already be taking vitamin D supplements anyway, per national guidance. 
Since then, a variety of published and unpublished studies investigating potential links between vitamin D and COVID-19 have appeared, but Dr. Joseph Lee, a general practitioner and co-author of the report, told us that he was not aware of any subsequent studies that would alter his group’s recommendation that “people should take vitamin D, but not because of COVID-19.”
Lanham-New, who was the lead author of the BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health review, also said her conclusions had not changed.
One U.K. study, published on May 6 in Aging Clinical and Experimental Research, identified a crude association between the average vitamin D level reported in 20 European countries and the number of per-capita COVID-19 cases and deaths in those nations. 
Another similar paper, appearing in the Irish Medical Journal, found an inverse relationship between the vitamin D levels in older people in different European countries, as reported in past studies, and a country’s COVID-19 mortality rate, with fish-loving Nordic countries generally faring better than those in southern Europe.
But these so-called ecological epidemiology studies can only hint at any effect of vitamin D, since they’re simple correlations at the population level. “This is not a design suited to identifying causal effects,” Lee said, “and I would not consider them as evidence of a role for vitamin D in COVID-19.”
Other reports also claim to identify links between lower levels of vitamin D and COVID-19 infection or disease severity in different cohorts of people, but most of these have not yet been vetted by other scientists through peer review. 
One unpublished report of 780 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia found that the majority of deaths occurred in patients with abnormally low vitamin D blood levels, and claimed to have found an association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 mortality after controlling for other factors, such as other preexisting health conditions.
But as Lanham-New noted in an interview, the paper “doesn’t in any way prove cause and effect.” Lee, too, said that while the authors attempted to control for other health conditions, the group did so in an odd way, lumping all of the conditions together. And even if the team had controlled for them individually, that doesn’t necessarily eliminate bias, so the relationship could reflect the fact that people who are in poorer health generally fare worse with COVID-19.
“It is relatively easy to calculate associations, and that is what most of these papers have done,” Penn State’s Ross said. “But associations do not show cause and effect, and in fact, ‘reverse causation’ is not carefully considered.” The disease itself could cause a reduction in a person’s vitamin D levels, she said, noting that there are negative associations of serum vitamin D with diabetes, obesity and other infections. “I place little confidence on any of these studies,” she said.
More credible, Ross said, were two analyses of U.K. biobank data, neither of which support the idea that less vitamin D leads to a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Given concerns that the disproportionate number of coronavirus infections in blacks and South Asians in the U.K. could be due to lower vitamin D levels in darker-skinned people, the researchers checked to see if there was any connection between a person’s vitamin D levels, which had been measured in participants about a decade ago, and testing positive for COVID-19.
While the published report affirmed that black and South Asian participants were several times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than whites, there was no association with vitamin D. The authors concluded that vitamin D “is unlikely to be the underlying mechanism for the higher risk observed in black and minority ethnic individuals and vitamin D supplements are unlikely to provide an effective intervention.”
The other analysis, which Lanham-New said has since been submitted to a journal with additional participant data, found no difference in vitamin D status among those who tested positive versus negative for COVID-19. She said additional work was planned once COVID-19 severity and mortality data became available.
Another consideration when interpreting many observational studies, Lee said, is something called collider bias, which can sometimes result in spurious correlations when the people included in a dataset aren’t representative of the wider population. Some researchers have already noted that COVID-19 studies may be especially prone to collider bias, making it hard to identify risk factors and medications that work.
Consider a study analyzing outcomes among people who are tested for COVID-19. Some people are likely getting tested because they are quite ill and have been admitted to the hospital, while others may be tested because they’re a health care worker or because they’re more privileged and have access to testing.
In this scenario, Lee said, people with good levels of vitamin D will be less likely to test positive, compared to the sick people. “This selection will in itself induce an association between low vitamin D and COVID-19 positive tests or severity of disease,” he said, “even if it isn’t true in the general population.”
Recommendations
In the end, Ross is skeptical that vitamin D will prove to be beneficial for COVID-19, although she hesitated to entirely discount the possibility, given how much is still unknown about the disease.
“[I]t is hard for me to conceive that vitamin D has much chance of being as effective as other kinds of treatments, if at all,” she said. “We don’t know however.”
Several randomized controlled trials are in the works, which may reveal a more concrete answer.
Her recommendation, irrespective of COVID-19, is to consume vitamin D-rich foods or take a supplement to provide the recommended dietary amount, or RDA, of 600-800 International Units per day. This matches the Institute of Medicine’s national guideline, which Ross helped write, and which assumes minimal sun exposure.
One cup of fortified milk, for example, contains 120 IUs of vitamin D, while a 3-ounce serving of cooked salmon provides 570 IUs.
Lanham-New emphasized that excessive doses of vitamin D should not be used. But especially for those who have been cooped up indoors while social distancing, it may be a good idea to take regular supplements. 
“If you’re in self-isolation, definitely be taking a vitamin D supplement according to your government guidelines,” she said. 
Lee also pointed to following state or national vitamin D recommendations. “There is no reason to think it will help with COVID-19, but that might change when the trials report,” he said of vitamin D. “Our advice is to take vitamin D in accordance with local guidelines.”

65,"Already Had COVID-19? Vaccines Boost Immunity, Not ‘Wipe Out’ Antibodies",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-already-had-covid-19-vaccines-boost-immunity-not-wipe-out-antibodies/,,"SciCheck Digest
Studies show the COVID-19 vaccines boost the antibody levels and improve the immune response of those who previously had COVID-19. The vaccines do not “wipe out” the antibodies developed by a person who had recovered from the disease, as social media posts have falsely claimed for months.


Full Story
Several studies show that COVID-19 vaccines provide additional protection for those who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccines are safe and effective at protecting people from getting sick, including those who’ve already recovered from the disease, and do not “wipe out” natural immunity, as social media posts have falsely claimed. 
Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told FactCheck.org that vaccination does not eliminate, reduce or replace the antibodies developed after a previous infection in any way. 
“Vaccination augments natural immunity, making it more robust and more durable,” he said in an email.
Yet hundreds of users of TikTok have rehashed an audio clip, first published as a video earlier this year, that deceitfully claims that COVID-19 vaccines eliminate the coronavirus antibodies developed after a previous infection. The TikTok videos, some of them with over 50,000 and 90,000 likes, show different people listening and reacting to the audio, which starts with a news anchor announcing a warning regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.  
The February clip from KMOV-4, a CBS-affiliated television station in St. Louis, Missouri, inaccurately says: “The Red Cross says anyone who has received their COVID-19 vaccine cannot donate convalescent plasma to help other COVID-19 patients in hospitals. That plasma is made up of antibodies from people who have recovered from the virus, but the vaccine wipes out those antibodies.”
The American Red Cross told FactCheck.org in an email that “the original information provided to the local station from the regional communicator was unfortunately misinterpreted during the broadcast.” The news station later corrected the information on May 27.
The Red Cross made clear then it was still accepting blood and plasma donations from vaccinated people, but that it had discontinued the convalescent plasma donation program by the end of March. Plasma is the clear fluid part of blood, while convalescent plasma is the plasma of people who have recovered from a disease, which contains antibodies to that disease. 
The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 to treat hospitalized patients with the disease on Aug. 23, 2020. On Feb. 4, 2021, after additional studies, the FDA revised the EUA to authorize only the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high levels of antibodies for the treatment of hospitalized patients early in the course of the disease and those who cannot produce an adequate antibody response. 
Data from clinical trials showed no clinical benefit in the use of convalescent plasma with low levels of antibodies. In its COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, the National Institutes of Health says several randomized clinical trials “have not demonstrated the efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19” who do not have impaired immunity, and the NIH recommend against the use of it outside of a clinical trial. Even for those with with impaired immunity, the NIH said there was “insufficient evidence … to recommend either for or against” the use of high-titer convalescent plasma.   
In a document offering guidance for COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations issued by the FDA in November, before the vaccines were authorized, people who had received a vaccine through a clinical trial were not eligible to donate convalescent plasma. That guidance was updated in January, making vaccinated people eligible if they’ve had a previous infection, received a diagnosis before they were vaccinated, and are within six months of resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. The guidance is “to ensure that COVID-19 convalescent plasma collected from donors contains sufficient antibodies directly related to their immune responses to COVID-19 infection.”
The plasma of those who have been vaccinated but who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not convalescent plasma, because they were never convalescent. An FDA spokesperson told us by email: “The data supporting the emergency use authorization of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was obtained from plasma donations from individuals who had COVID-19, not from vaccinated individuals who did not have COVID-19.” The spokesperson said that while a vaccinated person “is protected from getting COVID-19 … there is no data on whether their plasma might be effective for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.”
People with a previous infection and vaccinated people develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but there is a slight difference. A person who has been infected with the virus produces antibodies to multiple parts of the virus, including the nucleocapsid protein and others, while someone who gets an FDA-authorized or -approved vaccine only produces antibodies to the spike protein of the virus. The fact that the FDA included people with prior infections who were later vaccinated as eligible convalescent plasma donors debunks the myth that vaccine-induced antibodies wipe out antibodies developed after a natural infection.
The Red Cross didn’t implement the updated FDA guidance, because it stopped collecting convalescent plasma altogether. In an email to FactCheck.org, a Red Cross representative said the program was ended because of a decline in demand from hospitals, sufficient existing supply, and also “[c]omplex system changes” that would be needed to accept convalescent plasma from vaccinated donors.
The Red Cross told us it continued to test whole blood donations for COVID-19 antibodies until June 14, 2021, and was able to use those with high levels of antibodies as convalescent plasma.
In July, the Red Cross tried to debunk the misinformation with a Q&A on COVID-19 vaccines and blood or plasma donation eligibility.
“There are claims circulating that incorrectly state that the Red Cross will not accept convalescent plasma donations from those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine because ‘the vaccine wipes out those antibodies making the convalescent plasma ineffective in treating other COVID-19 patients.’ This is not accurate,” it says (emphasis is the Red Cross’).
The claims have since been fact-checked over and over and over, yet they continue to spread.
Dr. Rachel M. Presti, an associate professor of medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who helped conduct clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines and has studied the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 after infection and vaccination, says there is no evidence that the vaccines wipe out natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2, or to any other infection. 
“That would be something that would be … very readily abundant in the trials and especially in the initial safety studies. You know, we can detect, on a typical blood test, how much antibody you have in general, and we don’t see that change significantly after vaccination,” she said in a phone interview. If the vaccine could wipe out people’s entire immune system, the billions of vaccinated people would be getting infections all the time, she said, “[a]nd we are not seeing any of that clinically.”
The fact is, Presti added, antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 “always increase after vaccination.”
Vaccination Boosts Immunity
What Presti and other researchers have seen is that the vaccines significantly improve the immune response to the virus for those with previous infections. In fact, people with previous infections who get vaccinated develop what researchers are calling “hybrid immunity” or even “super-immunity.”
“What we’ve seen in our studies is people who got infected and then got vaccinated, have higher levels of antibodies to the spike protein, that protective antibody, than people who just got vaccinated,” Presti said. 
A study that looked at the immune response prompted by the mRNA vaccines in people with and without previous coronavirus infections, published by a team from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Science Immunology in April, found that “in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose.” A more recent study published by the team in Science in October found similar results.
Even though studies have found that most people who recover from COVID-19 are protected against reinfection, the strength of the immune response among people can vary and the duration of it remains unclear.
“Some people actually have fairly low antibody responses that are not sufficient to neutralize the virus, especially variant viruses. When you vaccinate them uniformly, you get high antibody titers [measurements] and high neutralization titers, so there’s an improvement in at least one of the key metrics of immunity following vaccination,” E. John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology and one of the lead authors of the studies, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview in April.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people who have recovered from COVID-19 get a vaccine because “research has not yet shown how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again” after recovering, and because “vaccination helps protect you even if you’ve already had COVID-19.”
A CDC study released in August found unvaccinated Kentucky residents who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 but remained unvaccinated were “more than twice as likely to be reinfected” with the virus than those who got a vaccine after an infection. 
Not All Nurses and Doctors Have Natural Immunity to COVID-19
In the midst of states and countries requiring health care workers to get vaccinated, one Instagram post pushing this claim also falsely stated that nurses and doctors don’t need vaccines “by definition” because everyone “who has worked in a hospital in the last two years without a v now has natural immunity.” 
That’s not correct. Johns Hopkins’ Adalja told us that although some nurses and doctors “have a degree of natural immunity if they were infected with the virus,” studies show that not all of them have antibodies. 
“For example, I have been taking care of COVID patients throughout the pandemic and had antibodies checked twice before I received my vaccine and was negative,” he wrote.
One study conducted by the CDC collected serum samples from frontline health care workers who worked with COVID-19 patients at 13 medical centers in the U.S. from April 3 to June 19, 2020. It found that 6% of 3,248 participants had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. That’s because the only way to get antibodies against the coronavirus at the time — before the vaccines were authorized — was to get infected by the virus, and not all health care workers got infected.
“Working on the frontlines doesn’t necessarily give you immunity,” Presti told us. “The reason that not all doctors and nurses got sick and died from COVID isn’t because they had natural immunity, it’s because they were wearing protective gear —  so masks, and gowns, and gloves, and face masks, so on.” 
The World Health Organization estimated that as of May 24, at least 115,000 health care workers have died from COVID-19 globally. And according to an International Council of Nurses report published in March “millions of COVID-19 infections have been reported among healthcare workers globally,” and about 3,000 nurses in 60 countries have died because of COVID-19.
“Nurses, their colleagues, and their peers, remain vulnerable to COVID-19, especially when unvaccinated,” the American Nurses Association, which supports the vaccine mandates, told FactCheck.org in an email. “Even with natural immunity, vaccination enhances immune response and provides additional protection in the absence of clear data that indicates the duration and strength of natural immunity in the presence of highly transmissible variants, such as Delta.”

“What we’ve seen in our studies is people who got infected and then got vaccinated, have higher levels of antibodies to the spike protein, that protective antibody, than people who just got vaccinated,” Presti said. If the vaccine could wipe out people’s entire immune system, the billions of vaccinated people would be getting infections all the time, she said, “[a nd we are not seeing any of that clinically.”
The fact is, Presti added, antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 “always increase after vaccination.”
Vaccination Boosts Immunity
What Presti and other researchers have seen is that the vaccines significantly improve the immune response to the virus for those with previous infections. “Nurses, their colleagues, and their peers, remain vulnerable to COVID-19, especially when unvaccinated,” the American Nurses Association, which supports the vaccine mandates, told FactCheck.org in an email. “The reason that not all doctors and nurses got sick and died from COVID isn’t because they had natural immunity, it’s because they were wearing protective gear —  so masks, and gowns, and gloves, and face masks, so on.” 
The World Health Organization estimated that as of May 24, at least 115,000 health care workers have died from COVID-19 globally. When you vaccinate them uniformly, you get high antibody titers [measurements  and high neutralization titers, so there’s an improvement in at least one of the key metrics of immunity following vaccination,” E. John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology and one of the lead authors of the studies, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview in April."
66,Trump and the ‘New Hoax’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-and-the-new-hoax/,,"7.9KDemocratic presidential candidates harshly criticized President Donald Trump for using the term “hoax” in connection with the coronavirus outbreak. There’s no question that the president described the disease as the Democrats’ “new hoax” at a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina.
But the following day, after the death of the first American from coronavirus in Washington state, Trump said that when he used the word “hoax,” he was referring to Democrats finding fault with his administration’s response to coronavirus, not the virus itself.
Even after Trump explained his remarks, some Democrats — including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg — continued to wrongly accuse Trump of describing the coronavirus as a “hoax.”
The kerfuffle began at the rally in North Charleston, South Carolina when Trump accused the Democrats of “politicizing” the coronavirus outbreak.
“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right?” he said. “Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.”
Then the president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as a hoax, continued, “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”
Trump went on to praise his administration for taking “the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States,” referring to travel restrictions on foreign nationals who recently visited China. 
“A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,” Trump said, “and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?”
Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Trump’s “hoax” remark. Former Vice President Joe Biden described the president’s comments as “absolutely bizarre”
“Look, this is a serious, serious problem,” Biden told MSNBC on Feb. 29. “It’s able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this,” Biden said. “But for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It’s just not a decent way to act.”
Biden told reporters in Greenville, South Carolina, on Feb. 29 “The president of the United States says it’s a hoax? It’s hard to believe. Even for him it’s hard to believe.”
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, at the time still a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, also said he was troubled by Trump’s use of the term “hoax.”
“It’s critically important that the administration and the White House handle this in a way that’s based on science and not based on politics,” Buttigieg said on NBC’s “Today” show on Feb. 29. “I was particularly disturbed to hear the word ‘hoax’ used by the president recently in talking about this issue.” 
Buttigieg ended his run for the White House on March 1.
In the wake of the criticism, Trump said at a press conference on Feb. 29 that he used the term “hoax” to refer not to coronavirus itself but to Democrats’ criticism of how his administration had responded to it.
Asked if he regretted using that particular word, he replied “No. No. No. Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them not… I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff…”
But that hardly put an end to criticism from Democrats.
In an interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on March 1, Bloomberg said, “I find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [Friday] night in South Carolina.”
Correspondent Scott Pelley responded, “He said that the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.”
And Bloomberg shot back, “This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world would say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, ‘We don’t know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.'”
A day later, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, similarly criticized Trump at a Biden rally on March 1 in Norfolk, Virginia.
“We got a guy in the White House who doesn’t know anything about patriotism, doesn’t know anything about empathy,” McAuliffe said. “He said the coronavirus was a hoax.”
But that’s not what Trump said he meant.",Rem Rieder,2020-03-03 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,” Trump said, “and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?”

67,Opening Ads in the Perdue-Ossoff Runoff,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/opening-ads-in-the-perdue-ossoff-runoff/,,"In the first TV ads of the runoff campaign that could help decide the balance of the Senate, Republican Sen. David Perdue warned his opponent would “radically change America,” while Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff accused his opponent of downplaying the coronavirus.
The ad from Perdue makes the misleading claims that Ossoff would “defund police” and provide “voting rights for illegal immigrants.” Ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police. And while he supports providing a pathway to citizenship to some 11 million immigrants currently in the country illegally, he does not support voting rights for noncitizens.
Ossoff’s ad offers similar side-by-side comments from Perdue and President Donald Trump that the ad contends show Perdue “ignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.”
We’ll leave it to readers to decide for themselves if Perdue’s comments did that, but some of the comments highlighted in the ad came early in the year at a time when medical experts were making similar comments. And Perdue made other comments warning about the seriousness of the virus and reinforcing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to reduce the spread of the virus.
Perdue’s Ad
The first TV ad of the runoff from the Perdue campaign begins with a clip of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer celebrating after Joe Biden was projected the winner of the presidential race, telling a crowd in New York, “Now we take Georgia, then we change America.”

If Democrats were to flip the two Senate seats in Georgia’s January runoff elections — Perdue vs. Ossoff and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler vs. Democrat Raphael Warnock — Democrats would control both houses of Congress and the presidency.
“You heard him,” the ad’s narrator says. “Chuck Schumer is trying to use Georgia to take the Senate majority and radically change America. The Schumer, Pelosi, Ossoff change? Defund police. Voting rights for illegal immigrants. Washington, D.C. as the 51st state.”
That’s a distortion of Ossoff’s positions. Ossoff has repeatedly said he does not support defunding police.
For example, in a Sirius XM radio interview on Sept. 11, Ossoff said, “I oppose defunding the police and I think frankly, it’s a counterproductive and foolish way of characterizing what I think for some folks is a desire to reform police.”
In an interview on WSB radio on June 11, Ossoff reiterated, “No, the answer is not to defund police. The answer is to reform police. And the answer is to demilitarize police. Far too many local police departments are heavily equipped with armored vehicles and military equipment, and when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”
The Perdue campaign points to comments Ossoff made in a radio interview in June: “You have to have national standards for the use of force, and yeah, you’ve got to be able to hold individual officers and entire departments accountable, and there also has to be funding for those departments on the line.” (Starting at the 19:39 mark.)
The Ossoff campaign says that Ossoff was talking about supplemental police funding, and that Ossoff’s position is similar to that of Biden, who in June told CBS News, “No, I don’t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.”
As we have written, there is no agreed upon definition for the term “defund the police.” Some police critics, who believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement, really do want to abolish police forces and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. Others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies.
Ossoff told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in August that he agrees with Biden’s position of tying federal funds for law enforcement agencies to meeting certain standards, including whether they can “demonstrate they can protect the community.”
The ad also distorts Ossoff’s position when it says he supports “voting rights for illegal immigrants.” Ossoff’s campaign told us he does not, and the Perdue campaign didn’t provide any evidence that he does.
The Perdue campaign points to Biden’s support for “providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants” currently in the U.S., including the so-called Dreamers who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. A bipartisan immigration bill that sought to do the same thing passed the Senate in 2013 with the support of 14 Republicans, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, who co-sponsored the bill. Ossoff’s policy similarly calls for creating “a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who are already here and otherwise follow the law.”
But that’s different from allowing “voting rights for illegal immigrants.” As we have written, it would likely take more than a dozen years under such legislation for immigrants to gain full citizenship, and voting rights. But they would then be citizens, not “illegal immigrants.” Ossoff’s campaign says he opposes voting rights for noncitizens.
The ad is correct that Ossoff supports statehood for Washington, D.C., but it’s not clear that statehood for D.C. could be accomplished even with a simple majority in the Senate. Under Senate rules, legislation can be blocked if it fails to receive the 60 votes necessary to end debate and move to a vote.
“Any effort to get DC statehood would be filibustered,” Norm Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us via email. “So the answer is that it would first require a change in the rules of the Senate to reform or end the filibuster, which is not going to happen with only 50 Democrats — at least not for some time. It could happen, if [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell’s Republicans used the filibuster to block everything — including COVID relief, infrastructure, and every other Biden initiative. But not for quite a while, and no sure thing at all.”
Ossoff’s Ad
The latest ad from the Ossoff campaign mirrors one it has been running since the summer, accusing Perdue of downplaying the coronavirus crisis. The runoff ad, called “Echo,” is updated to pair similar quotes from Perdue and Trump to make the case that Perdue “ignored the medical experts, downplayed the crisis and left us unprepared.”

We’ll just focus on the quotes attributed to Perdue. The quotes are accurate; however, they are misleadingly juxtaposed with a chart showing the rising COVID-19 death count. Some of Perdue’s comments were made early in the pandemic, long before the corresponding number of deaths reached the levels shown in the ad.
The first two quotes come from an interview Perdue did with The Valley’s Morning News podcast — a Georgia program  — on March 11. The bolded parts of the interview are included in the ad.
Perdue, March 11: It’s a balance between being precautionary and overreacting. And I think we have to realize that the risk of this virus in the United States right now still remains low. And the mortality rate is still being determined. The normal mortality rate of the normal flu is well under 1%. This so far is over 1%, but you know, so far, very, very few people have been exposed to it in the United States. […] So I think we’re doing what we should do right now. I don’t want to see America panic and overreact. But I do think it’s good for us to be precautionary and just take care of ourselves relative to whether we think we’re getting sick or have been exposed or anything like that.
Perdue went on to say that “the authorities are not taking this lightly. We’re presuming the worst and preparing for the worst. But at the same time, we’re hopeful this thing will burn itself out before we see a dramatic increase in the numbers here.”
The Perdue campaign also noted that in this interview, Perdue reiterated CDC guidance: “If you’re elderly or have a respiratory illness, be discretionary and stay away from large crowds. Use hand sanitizers, wash your hands frequently, try to stay away from people who are sick. And if you are sick, stay home. And if it feels like it’s getting serious, call a doctor, don’t go run to the emergency room right away but call a physician and get advice.”
To put these comments in the context of the moment, the day before the interview, there were about 1,500 COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with about 37 deaths, according to the COVID Tracking Project. At that time, the New York Times reported 17 cases in Georgia, and no deaths.
In comments on Feb. 29, less than two weeks before Perdue’s interview, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show that the risk from COVID-19 “is still low,” and he said there was no need for people to change their daily routines “at this moment.” But he warned that could change if “you start to see community spread.” Fauci said the virus could develop into a “major outbreak” or “it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled.”
On March 9, just two days before Perdue’s comments, Fauci was still talking about the coronavirus as “an evolving thing” and that holding campaign rallies “in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment.”
Things changed quickly though in the days after Perdue made those comments on March 11. The day of that interview, the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak a pandemic, and two days later, Trump announced a national emergency.


The ad then highlights a comment Perdue made at a Chamber of Commerce meeting on May 14: “We’ve had ordinary flu seasons with more deaths.” Perdue rightly noted that there were about 80,000 deaths from COVID-19 at that time, and there were an estimated 61,000 influenza deaths in the 2017-2018 flu season (though the average over the last decade has been fewer than 40,000 per year). But even at the time it was a flawed comparison and, of course, COVID-19-related deaths continued to mount through the summer and fall (and now stand at more than 247,000). We have repeatedly fact-checked the president for making faulty comparisons between the flu and COVID-19, which has proven to be much more deadly (as medical experts repeatedly warned).
The ad then uses a quote from Perdue at a different Chamber of Commerce meeting on April 28: “The numbers projected were supposed to be much worse.” Perdue credited Trump’s actions for keeping those numbers down.
As we have written numerous times in the past when Trump claimed to have averted some 2 million deaths, a forecast of 2.2 million deaths in the U.S. is based on a model from Imperial College London in March that predicted U.S. deaths if no mitigation measures were taken and no individual behavior changes occurred. The figure, therefore, was not intended to be an estimate of likely deaths.
And as we have written, research does support the idea that lockdowns — which were instituted by states, not Trump — saved lives earlier this year, although it’s hard to say how many. 
Finally, the ad uses a clip from Perdue being interviewed on CNBC on June 16 in which he was asked about the reopening plan in Georgia. “It’s going very well,” Perdue said.
Fauci and other medical experts were critical in May of Georgia and some other Republican-led states for opening too early. At the time, Perdue told Politico that he had recently eaten in restaurants twice in Georgia and, “We’ve got to get this economy open again. We’re on the back side of the cycle.” However, new cases spiked in Georgia in July and August.
Readers can make what they will of Perdue’s comments and decide for themselves if he downplayed the virus.
The Perdue campaign points to other comments and statements Perdue made around the same time that suggest he took the pandemic seriously and took measures to help protect the public.
For example, on March 2 after the first two cases of the coronavirus were reported in Georgia, Perdue and Loeffler issued a press release stating, in part, “We’re closely monitoring the cases of coronavirus in Georgia and urge everyone to take extra precautions. Governor Kemp and the Trump Administration are working with us to ensure we keep Georgians healthy and safe. It is of utmost importance that Georgia has the resources necessary to respond accordingly.”
And on March 23, Perdue released a public service announcement via video, which began: “First of all, I know this virus is causing a lot of concern, and rightfully so. Let me assure you of this: the world’s best public health officials are right here in Georgia at the CDC. They’re working around the clock to help contain this virus and to develop a vaccine.”



Perdue, March 23: The President’s early travel restrictions gave us time to prepare for the virus, and we’re continuing to take action to safeguard public health. We’re doing this by cutting red tape, partnering with the private sector to expand testing availability, and ensuring state and local officials have the resources they need. We’re also working on ways to help families and businesses that might be impacted financially.
Finally, please remember to follow the advice of public health officials: stay home if you are sick; wash your hands frequently with soap and water; keep a safe distance from others. If you are experiencing symptoms, call your health care provider right away. You don’t necessarily need to go there, just call them and give them your symptoms.

The Perdue campaign also pointed to a number of COVID-19-related actions Perdue has taken, including helping small businesses access the Paycheck Protection Program and helping to locate personal protective equipment for front-line workers.
The Perdue campaign also touted measures in the CARES Act, a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to bolster the economy in response to the coronavirus pandemic. It included direct payments to Americans, loans for small businesses, support for hospitals and more. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate. Perdue, of course, voted for it, although he opposed two of its major provisions: the direct payment of $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals and the $600-per-week in additional unemployment payments.
One one front, Perdue has been out ahead of, and clearer than, the president: encouraging the public to wear masks.
Trump has waffled on his support for mask-wearing from the start — saying on April 3, the day the CDC issued recommendations for public mask-wearing, that he would not personally be wearing a mask. In an interview in early May, Perdue said that in Senate meetings the week before, “We all wore masks. We actually had a meeting before then (and) we had masks. And we have hand sanitizers, signs everywhere about washing hands and maintaining social distance. I think it’s very important that America sees that, that we are functioning, and that this is an essential part of life, that we work together.”
In an interview on Fox News on June 30, Perdue said, “I absolutely support wearing masks. We wear them here in the Senate. We’ve been back here for five weeks. We follow the protocols that the military and our essential workers have been following. We wash our hands, we use masks, and if we follow that, I believe the infection rate can be managed.”
And on July 9, Perdue tweeted a picture of himself wearing a mask and imploring the public to “wear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing.”
That was 11 days before Trump did the same thing.
In Ossoff’s ad, a chart shows the rising COVID-19 death count, while Trump and Perdue comment about the virus. But the chart is misleading. For example, when Perdue said “the risk of this virus … still remains low,” the chart shows the number of deaths increasing from about 15,000 to 83,000. But, as we said, that comment was made when there were about 1,500 cases and about 37 deaths nationwide (and just 17 cases and no deaths in Georgia). Similarly, the graphic shows the death count rising from about 180,000 to about 210,000 when Perdue said “the numbers projected were supposed to be much worse” — when, in fact, there were 54,761 deaths at the time of his remarks on April 28.
That puts Perdue’s comments in a worse light. Still, Perdue’s comments comparing COVID-19 to the flu, praising Georgia’s early reopening plan and crediting Trump for keeping the death count below projections are all flawed. But again, we’ll let readers determine for themselves if those comments prove Perdue “ignored the medical experts” and “downplayed the crisis.”

68,FactChecking Trump’s Weekend Press Briefings,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/factchecking-trumps-weekend-press-briefings/,,"President Donald Trump made several false, misleading and exaggerated claims in press briefings he held Aug. 7 and 8 at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, spinning the facts on COVID-19 and the economy, among other topics:

Trump falsely claimed that “the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction,” even though the House Democrats had already passed a coronavirus relief bill to do exactly that.
The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions or charging them higher premiums. Yet Trump made the curious claim that he would pursue an executive order to require “health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers,” falsely adding this had “never been done before.”
Trump misleadingly said that more than half of U.S. counties reported fewer than 20 COVID-19 cases in the past week. That’s correct for cases reported between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7, but those counties make up less than 10% of the U.S. population.
The president exaggerated when he said the percentage of national emergency room visits for COVID-19 symptoms “is down to almost half what it was in July.” It is down only 29% from the July peak.
Trump once again misleadingly claimed that testing was behind the United States’ large number of cases, boasting that the U.S. “is only 5% of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25% of the world’s testing.” While American testing is better than some countries, it does not explain the huge caseload, nor does it change the fact that the U.S. also has 22% of the world’s COVID-19 deaths.
Trump falsely said if the Democrats controlled Washington, they would pass “legislation gutting every single police department in America.” Nearly 90% of funding for police comes from local governments, and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said he opposes “defunding the police.”
The president falsely said that “everybody” — Republicans and Democrats alike — was in favor of the payroll tax cut he has long sought. There is bipartisan opposition to the proposal.
He claimed “the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.” The HEROES Act expands eligibility for payments only to certain immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who filed federal income tax returns using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.
Trump boasted of the nearly 9.3 million jobs added in the U.S. since May but neglected to mention the 22.2 million in job losses in March and April.
He similarly cited nearly 1 million in job creation for African Americans but left out the March and April job losses of 3.5 million. 
He exaggerated in saying the Democratic relief bill would require the “mass release” of “illegal aliens” from detention centers and “serious felons” from prisons. The bill would not release detainees subject to “mandatory detention,” and would apply only to certain prisoners within one year of release.
Trump again wrongly claimed that Biden “wants to rip down the wall” the Trump administration has constructed along the Mexican border. Biden has said only that he would not build any more wall, not that he would dismantle existing fencing.
The president repeated his bogus claim about the genesis of the Veterans Choice program, which was launched in 2014 under the Obama administration. Trump took credit for the law, claiming “no president’s ever been able to do it, and we got it done.”

The HEROES Act, or the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, passed the Democratic-controlled House in May by a vote of 208-199. (One Republican voted in favor; 14 Democrats voted against.) But negotiations broke down on Aug. 7 between the White House and congressional Democratic leaders to find a coronavirus relief bill both sides could support.
Trump spoke about the Democratic bill, his executive orders on relief efforts, the coronavirus pandemic and more in the Aug. 7 and 8 press briefings.
False Evictions Claim
On Aug. 8, Trump signed an executive order that directs his administration to identify federal funds “to provide temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners” and “to promote the ability of renters and homeowners to avoid eviction or foreclosure” due to the coronavirus.
In signing the order, Trump falsely claimed that “the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction,” even though the House Democrats had already passed a bill to do exactly that.
Trump, Aug. 8: So I’m protecting people from eviction. Yet you’ve been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction. I said, “Let’s do that separately. That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live.” And they didn’t even want to protect people from eviction.
In fact, the House — without a single Republican vote — passed the Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act, which would provide $100 billion for emergency rental assistance and create a $75 billion homeowners assistance fund. It also would extend the eviction and foreclosure moratorium for certain renters and homeowners that was put in place by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act.
The CARES Act protected “most residents of federally subsidized apartments, including those supported by HUD, USDA or Treasury (Low Income Housing Tax Credit developments) as well a moratorium on filings for evictions for renters in homes covered by federally-backed (FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac) mortgages” for 120 days, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The moratorium expired July 24, but the House Democratic bill would extend the protections until March 2021.
The Senate Republicans did not include an extension of the eviction protections in their package of coronavirus relief bills.
Preexisting Conditions
Trump made the curious claim that he would pursue an executive order to require “health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers,” claiming this had “never been done before.” The Affordable Care Act already enacted such preexisting conditions protections.
The ACA, signed by then-President Barack Obama in 2010, prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, charging them higher premiums or excluding coverage of certain conditions based on health status.
The Department of Health and Human Services’ website says these protections went into effect in 2014: “These rules went into effect for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.”
Trump, Aug. 7: Over the next two weeks, I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers. That’s a big thing. I’ve always been very strongly in favor — we have to cover pre-existing conditions. So we will be pursuing a major executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all of its customers.
This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of.
Trump acknowledged to reporters on Aug. 10 that this executive order would simply reinforce what the ACA had already done. “Just a double safety net and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally and strongly in favor of preexisting conditions, taking care of people with preexisting conditions,” he said. Trump justified his “never been done before” comment by saying “as an executive order, it hasn’t been done before.”
Of course, an executive order restating existing law wouldn’t change anything.
The Trump administration has actually worked to reduce the preexisting condition protections under the ACA in several ways. It has backed a lawsuit to nullify the law, even arguing at one point that preexisting condition provisions would have to go if the suit were succesful. The administration later backed the full invalidation of the health care law. (The Supreme Court should hear arguments for that case — California v. Texas — in the fall, with a decision not expected until next year.)
Trump also supported Republican health care legislation in 2017 that would have included some, but not all, of the ACA’s protections. And the president pushed the expansion of cheaper short-term health plans that wouldn’t have to abide by the ACA’s protections, including prohibitions against denying or pricing coverage based on health status.
Trump’s COVID-19 Spin
In claiming that the U.S. is “doing very well” with the coronavirus, Trump boasted in the Aug. 7 briefing of the large number of U.S. counties with fewer than 20 cases of COVID-19.
“More than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week,” he said. 
Data from USAFacts, a not-for-profit that supplies data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that the president is correct, if using cases reported between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7. In that time span, 1,635 counties or county equivalents had fewer than 20 COVID-19 cases, versus 1,507 with 20 or more.
But what Trump does not share is the number of people who live in those areas — less than 31 million, or 9.4% of the U.S. population. That means more than 90% of the American population lives in a county with 20 or more COVID-19 cases.
The numbers flip if looking for new cases reported between July 31 and Aug. 7, which covers the full past week. In that timeframe, 1,608 counties or county equivalents — accounting for 91.5% of the population — had 20 or more cases, versus 1,534 below that threshold.
Trump then proceeded to overstate the progress seen in the nation’s surveillance system.
“Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July,” Trump said.
But data from the CDC does not show that much of a drop. On Aug. 7, the CDC released its figures for the week ending Aug. 1, which found 2.9% of emergency room visits were for a COVID-19-like illness. That’s an improvement from three weeks prior, when the July peak was at 4.1%. But it’s only a 29% decline, not one of almost 50%.
Later, Trump returned to one of his favorite topics: COVID-19 testing.
Trump, Aug. 7: The United States is only 5% of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25% of the world’s testing. Think of that: 5% and we’ve given 25% of the world’s testing. Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we’re constantly showing cases — cases, cases, cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up, because we’re doing — one of the reasons — we’re doing a lot of testing. We’re doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests where other countries have done very little testing.
Trump is right that the number of confirmed cases needs to take testing into account. But as we have explained before, the large number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. isn’t just due to testing; it also stems from increased transmission of the virus. And many other countries are still doing more testing per coronavirus case — meaning they are doing more testing for the size of their outbreaks.
Figures from Our World in Data show that as of Aug. 10, or around that date, the U.S. has done only 12.4 tests per COVID-19 case, which is below the majority of the rest of the world. New Zealand has done a whopping 407; Australia, 235; and South Korea, 110.
It’s difficult to know what percentage of the world’s tests the U.S. has done because data is missing for numerous countries and countries report test data differently. The White House did not explain how the president arrived at his 25% claim. But according to the information available on Worldometer, the U.S. accounts for about 17.8% of all tests to date. That includes 90 million tests in China, which if correct, would be more than the U.S.’s 66 million tests. If leaving out all tests from China — an extreme underestimation — the U.S.’s percentage swells to 23.6%.
The U.S. is actually 4.3% of the world population, per the Census Bureau, not quite 5%. More critically, Trump highlighted testing percentage, which is uncertain, but did not also share that the U.S. has 25% of the world’s coronavirus cases and 22% of the world’s coronavirus deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. Caveats about reporting aside, it’s clear that the U.S. has a disproportionate number of both cases and deaths, given its population.
False Claim on Democrats and Police
Trump also falsely said that if the Democrats controlled Washington, they would pass “legislation gutting every single police department in America.”
Trump, Aug. 7: If the Democrats controlled in Washington — the Democrats’ control of Washington — they’d pass — with all of the things they do — legislation gutting every single police department in America. They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department. At a minimum, they’re to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department. No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe. Your suburbs would be a disaster. Your cities, your towns would be a disaster.
First of all, even if the Democrats in Washington wanted to, they would not be able to do much “gutting” of police spending. According to a backgrounder by the Urban Institute, 86% of police funding in 2017 was from local governments, with additional money ponied up by state governments. “Nearly all spending on both police and corrections was funded by state and local governments because federal grants account for a very small share of both expenditures,” the report said.
But there is no reason to think they want to. As we have written, presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said several times that he is opposed to defunding the police. “While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people’s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,” the former vice president said in a June 10 op-ed.
A campaign spokesman also told us Biden supports more funding for police for initiatives to strengthen community relationships and for body-worn cameras.
That hasn’t stopped Trump from making the false claim about Biden, as he did in a highly publicized interview with Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” which aired on July 19. Wallace quickly pointed out that Biden didn’t support defunding the police. And it hasn’t stopped the Trump campaign from running a series of ads suggesting criminals would run amok in a Biden administration. The ads, which feature images of rioting and mayhem and ringing but unanswered police telephones, convey the message that people “won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”
Trump also falsely claimed in the Wallace interview that “defunding the police” was called for in a collection of recommendations put together by supporters of Biden and his vanquished rival in the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. That also is false. There is no mention of it in the recommendations of the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force.
There is no agreed upon definition for the term “defund the police.” Some critics of the police, who believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement, really do want to abolish police forces and replace them with other forms of community safety entities. Others advocate shifting some money and functions away from police departments to social service agencies.
But Trump’s comments and campaign ads depict defunding the police as meaning taking away significant amounts of money, crippling law enforcement.
In one interview, Biden did say he was open to the idea in some cases of shifting some funds from the police to social service agencies. But Biden said in the same interview, “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police.”
Nothing Biden has said backs up the idea that he would seek legislation “gutting” law enforcement and making Americans unsafe.
 Not ‘Everybody’ Supports Payroll Tax Cut
Trump falsely said that “everybody” — Republicans and Democrats alike — was in favor of the payroll tax cut he has long sought.
Reporter, Aug. 8: Sir, the payroll tax cut was opposed by both parties on Capitol Hill. Can you give your rationale as to why you think that’s important, particularly since it doesn’t help Americans who (inaudible)?
Trump: Yeah. Okay. It helps people greatly. It helps our country get back. And anybody that would say anything different, I think, is very foolish. Everybody wanted it. By the way, the Democrats want it. The Republicans want it. They just couldn’t get it — they just couldn’t come to an agreement, but everybody wants it. And the very important thing is the people want it, and the people need it, actually.
But that is not the case. Democrats have resisted cutting or suspending the payroll tax. And Republicans, who have loyally supported the president on many issues, have expressed little enthusiasm for the idea. Even before the talks on the latest coronavirus assistance legislation broke down, the White House gave up on the payroll tax cut in the face of GOP opposition.
For example, Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber’s second-ranking Republican, told reporters on July 21, “I’m not a fan of that. I’ve been very clear about that. We’ll see what it looks like, but if it’s a choice between doing [stimulus] checks and a payroll-tax cut, I think it’s pretty clear that the checks have a more direct benefit to the economy.”
Sen. Charles Grassley, a Kansas Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also expressed reservations. “Go to the fact that Social Security people think we’re raiding the Social Security fund,” Grassley said on July 20. “And we are raiding it, but we have always put in general fund revenue in it so it is made whole. But that creates — it might create political problems — but it creates a public relations problem.”
In a television interview on July 24, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, generally a staunch ally of the president, explained why the payroll tax provision would be left out of the legislation. He said there was “bipartisan opposition” to the idea, adding, “I think we’re a lot better off just to send another direct cash payment to those who’ve been left out of all of this. It’s the quickest and easiest way to get relief. A payroll tax [cut], of course, would only help those who have a job.”
From the outset, Democrats on Capitol Hill were against the idea. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said on July 21 that a payroll tax cut “not only will harm those who rely on Social Security, but will do nothing for the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs during this crisis.”
Stimulus Payments
Trump claimed in the Aug. 8 briefing that “the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.” That’s true only for some individuals living in the U.S. illegally who also file federal income taxes.
The HEROES Act includes another $1,200 refundable tax credit — paid in advance — for eligible individuals and households based on their 2018 or 2019 federal income tax returns. The credit is $1,200 for single taxpayers and $2,400 for joint filers. An additional $1,200 would be available for each dependent up to a maximum of three dependents. For individuals, the tax credit phases out starting at $75,000 of modified adjusted gross income. For heads of households and joint filers, the income cutoffs are $112,500 and $150,000, respectively.
Unlike the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed into law in late March, the HEROES Act would make the “economic impact payments” available to those who filed federal income taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN.
ITINs are used by individuals — including people living in the U.S. illegally — who file their taxes and do not have, or are not eligible to receive, a Social Security number. “In 2015, 4.4 million ITIN filers paid over $5.5 billion in payroll and Medicare taxes and $23.6 billion in total taxes,” according to a 2015 report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued that those people should’ve never been left out of the CARES Act, which denied stimulus payments of similar amounts to individuals without — or joint filers married to someone without — a Social Security number.
The HEROES Act would make some taxpayers who filed with ITINs — and meet other requirements — retroactively eligible for payments under the CARES Act as well.
Jobs
Trump boasted of job growth since May, but neglected to mention the historic job losses that preceeded it.
In his Aug. 7 remarks, Trump correctly said the U.S. had “added 1.8 million new jobs in July” and exaggerated slightly in saying the job growth totaled “over 9.3 million jobs since May.” It was just under that: 9,279,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“And I will say that the job growth that we’ve seen over the last three months — 9.3 million — is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history,” he continued.
BLS data on employment, dating back to 1939, shows no other three-month period coming close to the magnitude of that job growth; however, no other two-month period comes close to the job loss in March and April. Those losses totaled 22.2 million.
The unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April and was 10.2% in July. In February, the U.S. rate was 3.5%.
Trump touted a drop in the unemployment rate for Latinos, saying, “Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32%.” That’s the drop in the unemployment rate, from 18.9% in April to 12.9% in July, a decline of 6 percentage points. The rate was 4.4% in February.
He also cited a record for African Americans: “Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns — incredibly hard — increased by nearly 1 million over the past three months, and that’s also a record. That’s a job record: African American, 1 million. It’s job record.”
Similar to the job losses and gains for the U.S. as a whole, African American employment has rebounded somewhat, with the gain of 921,000 jobs from May through July. But that comes after 3.5 million jobs lost in March and April.
‘Mass Release’ of ‘Illegal Aliens,’ ‘Serious Felons’
Trump exaggerated in claiming the Democratic relief bill would “require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention” and “compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons.”
Trump, Aug. 8: They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons. How do you like that one? And this is in the bill that we’re talking about? What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy? What does this have to do with the coronavirus?
The $3 trillion House bill, known as the HEROES Act, includes provisions that are designed to reduce populations in crowded federal facilities, such as immigration detention centers and prisons, to prevent coronavirus outbreaks.
In a section known as the “Pandemic Justice Response Act,” the bill would require the release of inmates who are within 12 months of being released from prison, or those who are juveniles or over 50 years old, or have a “covered health condition,” such as diabetes, heart disease and chronic lung disease. Such inmates would be subject to community supervision for the remainder of their prison sentences.
The director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons “may not place in community supervision any individual determined, by clear and convincing evidence, to be likely to pose a specific and substantial risk of causing bodily injury to or using violent force against the person of another,” the bill states.
It is worth noting the bill would apply only to federal prisons — which hold a small percentage of those incarcerated in the U.S. Of the nearly 2.2 million people incarcerated in the U.S. in 2016, only 188,000 — or 8.7% — were held in federal prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (table 3). There are currently only about 157,000 federal inmates, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
In the case of immigrant detainees, the Democratic bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to review immigration files of all detainees and release those “who are not subject to mandatory detention laws” and not a “threat to public safety or national security.”
Those subject to mandatory detention (and therefore not eligible for release under the Democratic bill) have been convicted of crimes “involving moral turpitude,” such as drug offenses, human trafficking and money laundering, or specific offenses, such as aggravated felony and firearm offenses, according to a 2019 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
The Democratic bill is consistent with existing law. The Immigration and Nationality Act “permits aliens who are not subject to mandatory detention to be released on bond or on their own recognizance,” according to the CRS report.
The bill is also consistent with current ICE enforcement policy. In mid-March, ICE announced that because of the pandemic it would temporarily adjust its enforcement priorities to “focus enforcement on public safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds” — the two groups that would still be detained under the Democratic bill.
Since announcing its new enforcement policy, the detainee population has declined from 37,888 on March 7 to 21,546 on Aug. 1, and the percentage of detainees with criminal convictions has increased from 38% to 53%.
So, the Democratic bill is consistent with existing immigration law and current ICE enforcement policy.
Biden Would Not Tear Down Wall
Trump again wrongly claimed that Biden “wants to rip down the wall” the Trump administration has constructed along the Mexican border. But as we have written, Biden has said only that he would not build any more wall, not that he would dismantle existing fencing.
“I think from what I’ve heard, Joe Biden, sleepy Joe wants to rip the wall down,” Trump said. “He wants people to pour into our country. They want to have open borders.”
The Trump administration has constructed about 200 miles of border fencing, though most of it is replacement for dilapidated fencing or fencing with outdated designs. Less than four miles of fencing has been built where there was no fencing before.
Biden has not said he would tear down the fencing that has been constructed by the Trump administration, nor has he advocated for open borders. To the contrary, in an Aug. 5 interview, NPR reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro asked Biden directly, “Trump campaigned on ‘Build that wall.’ Are you willing to tear that wall down?”
“No,” Biden responded, “there will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration. … I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is happening.”
A Repeated Falsehood on Veterans Choice
For nearly two years, Trump has been spreading a bogus tale that he was responsible for enacting legislation to create the Veterans Choice program, when, in fact, that legislation was signed by Obama in 2014.
The president again made the claim in his Aug. 8 press briefing, saying, “And they’ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no president’s ever been able to do it, and we got it done so veterans have choice.”
That echoes Trump’s prior claims that it’s something people had been “trying to get” for “almost 50 years,” or “44 years.” He has even claimed the program — which allows veterans to receive care from non-VA health care providers if they were unable to get timely appointments or face long travel to VA facilities — was his idea, calling it “the greatest idea I think I’ve ever had.”
The Veterans Choice legislation passed easily in August 2014, with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. Only eight lawmakers in Congress opposed the final bill. Trump has continued the program.
This time when Trump made the claim, a reporter called him out on the falsehood, and the president ended the press conference.
Reporter, Aug. 8: Why do you keep saying that you passed Veterans … Veterans Choice? It was passed in 2014. … But it’s a false statement, sir.
Trump: Okay, thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much.",Lori Robertson,2020-08-10 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"In the case of immigrant detainees, the Democratic bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to review immigration files of all detainees and release those “who are not subject to mandatory detention laws” and not a “threat to public safety or national security.”

President Donald Trump made several false, misleading and exaggerated claims in press briefings he held Aug. 7 and 8 at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, spinning the facts on COVID-19 and the economy, among other topics:

Trump falsely claimed that “the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction,” even though the House Democrats had already passed a coronavirus relief bill to do exactly that. In a section known as the “Pandemic Justice Response Act,” the bill would require the release of inmates who are within 12 months of being released from prison, or those who are juveniles or over 50 years old, or have a “covered health condition,” such as diabetes, heart disease and chronic lung disease."
69,Basketball Star Bradley Beal’s Misleading Comments About COVID-19,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-basketball-star-bradley-beals-misleading-comments-about-covid-19/,,"NBA star Bradley Beal made some misleading comments — shared in viral video clips — about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. No vaccine is 100% effective, but clinical trials and studies show the COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing illness, particularly serious illness, including for those previously infected, such as Beal.

The NBA, which starts its season on Oct. 19, isn’t requiring players to be vaccinated against COVD-19. But unvaccinated players will undergo regular testing, including one test on practice or travel days and at least one test on game days.
During an NBA media day on Sept. 27, Bradley Beal, an All-Star guard for the Washington Wizards, said that he has not received a COVID-19 vaccine due to “personal reasons.”  
Along with asking questions about the vaccines at the press conference, Beal made some misleading comments about their effectiveness. Video clips of his comments on Instagram, and posts about the video on Facebook, have reached over 97,000 interactions, according to CrowdTangle analytics. 
We’ll address Beal’s questions and clear up some misinformation that may have been spread.
Beal said he “would like an explanation” as to why people who have received vaccines “are still getting COVID, if that’s something that we are supposed to highly be protected from.”
As we have written before, no vaccine is 100% effective at preventing illness. But all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved and authorized for use in the U.S. (Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson) are effective at preventing symptomatic disease.
 However, so-called “breakthrough” cases of COVID-19 after vaccination are to be expected — perhaps even more so now because of the more contagious delta variant of the virus. 
In clinical trials, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe disease. Studies have shown some drop in effectiveness against the delta variant: A U.K. study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July found that the Pfizer vaccine effectiveness against delta was 88% in preventing symptomatic disease. But another U.K. study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found the Pfizer effectiveness at preventing hospitalization with the delta variant was 96%.
“Even if you’ve gotten a vaccine there is still a chance,” albeit a “much lower” one, “that you can get symptomatic infection” after contracting the virus from an unvaccinated person, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, has told FactCheck.org. “There is still a chance that you can get serious infection and there is still a chance you can be hospitalized or die from that infection.”
Beal further questioned the effectiveness of the vaccines, saying, “‘Oh, ‘it reduced your chances of going to the hospital.’” Beal then paused and shook his head before continuing: “It doesn’t eliminate anybody from getting COVID, right?”
It’s not clear what Beal meant by shaking his head after saying if the vaccine reduces your chances of going to the hospital. But vaccination does reduce the likelihood of hospitalization, serious illness or death due to COVID-19. (See chart below, “COVID-19-associated Hospitalizations Among Unvaccinated and Fully Vaccinated.”)
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since delta became the most common variant, unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated Americans are 4.5 times more likely to become infected, 10 times more likely to require hospitalization, and 11 times more likely to die due to COVID-19 than fully vaccinated Americans. The CDC study, which was released Sept. 10, reviewed nearly 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states.  

Beal went on to address the reporters in the room, asking if they were vaccinated. “So is everybody in here vaxxed? I would assume, right? So, you all can still get COVID, right? OK, but you can still get COVID. Right. OK, and you can still pass it along even with the vax, right? I’m just asking a question.” 
Beal is correct that vaccinated people can still transmit the disease to someone else, perhaps particularly since the emergence of the delta variant. The CDC has cited data that indicated with delta, infected vaccinated individuals have similar viral loads to those who are unvaccinated. However, several experts told us that doesn’t mean vaccinated individuals are equally likely to spread the virus, for several reasons. For one, vaccinated people likely aren’t infected as long as unvaccinated people, since their immune systems are quicker to respond to the virus.
The CDC has said “studies suggest that vaccinated people who become infected with Delta have potential to be less infectious than infected unvaccinated people” and that more data are needed.
However, more unvaccinated people in a population leads to more virus transmission, as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia explains. Vaccinated individuals are much less likely to be infected with the virus in the first place.
Vaccine Benefits for Those Previously Infected
Beal, a member of the 2021 NBA All-Star team, missed the opportunity to play in the 2021 summer Tokyo Olympics due to health-and-safety protocols with Team USA after testing positive for COVID-19 in July. He also acknowledged at the press event that he had contracted COVID-19 earlier in the year.

“Yeah, I had [COVID-19] but that doesn’t mean I can’t get it again. It is no different than with somebody with the vaccine. Yes, I developed the antibodies for it so my chances would be less likely now as well, right? But still a possibility I may get it. Just like there are players and coaches and staff who are [vaccinated] and missing camp because of [COVID-19] right now,” Beal said.
Beal is right in saying he should have some natural immunity, but, as we have written before, the previously infected can benefit from getting a COVID-19 vaccine. In August, the CDC released a study that found unvaccinated Kentucky residents who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 had a 2.3 times greater chance of being reinfected in May and June 2021 compared with the fully vaccinated.
E. John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the vaccines improved the immune response in individuals who had previously been infected by raising the levels of neutralizing antibodies.
“Some people actually have fairly low antibody responses that are not sufficient to neutralize the virus, especially variant viruses. When you vaccinate them uniformly, you get high antibody titers [measurements] and high neutralization titers, so there’s an improvement in at least one of the key metrics of immunity following vaccination,” explained Wherry, one of the lead authors of a study looking at the immune responses to the mRNA vaccines in individuals with and without previous infections.
Beal said that he understands both sides of the “vaccination argument,” adding that his parents, older brothers and “people very close” to him are vaccinated. He also said he has “people very close and related” to him that aren’t vaccinated. 
Beal’s wife, Kamiah Adams-Beal, tweeted in January, “Yalllll go right ahead and play around with that vaccine if you want to.” In a separate Instagram post, she seemed to imply that baseball legend Hank Aaron’s death earlier this year was caused by the vaccine. As we’ve reported, the medical examiner’s office in Fulton County, Georgia, attributed Aaron’s death to natural causes.
Rare Risk of Adverse Effects
Beal also expressed concerns about side effects of the vaccine. “Some people have bad reactions to the vaccine. Nobody likes to talk about that. What happens if one of our players gets the vaccine and they can’t play after that or they have complications after that because there are cases like that. But I feel like we don’t talk about those as heavily because they are so minute maybe? But they are existent.” 
The CDC reports that many people who get the vaccines experience mild side effects — such as pain at the injection site, a headache, chills or fever. The CDC also explains a “small number of people have had a severe allergic reaction (called ‘anaphylaxis’) after vaccination, but this is rare. If this occurs, vaccination providers have medicines available to effectively and immediately treat the reaction.” There have been 2 to 5 cases of anaphylaxis per 1 million vaccine doses administered, according to the CDC.
The CDC is also continuing to investigate the relationship between the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines and rare cases of myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (an inflammation of the surrounding lining of the heart), particularly in males ages 30 and younger. As of Sept. 22, the CDC and FDA have confirmed 892 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Most patients “responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better,” the CDC notes. More than 370 million doses of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines have been administered in the U.S.
The day after the NBA press conference, Beal said he is “still considering getting the vaccine.”
Although the NBA is not mandating vaccination for all players, individual teams have the authority to require vaccinations for players and staff during the season. Players in New York City and San Francisco are required to get vaccinated in order to play in home games, unlike Beal and the Wizards.
Michele Roberts, outgoing executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, told Yahoo Sports’ Vincent Goodwill in July that 10% of the league’s players remained unvaccinated. The WNBA announced in June that 99% of its players were fully vaccinated.",Brea Jones,2021-10-01 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“Even if you’ve gotten a vaccine there is still a chance,” albeit a “much lower” one, “that you can get symptomatic infection” after contracting the virus from an unvaccinated person, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, has told FactCheck.org. “There is still a chance that you can get serious infection and there is still a chance you can be hospitalized or die from that infection.”
Beal further questioned the effectiveness of the vaccines, saying, “‘Oh, ‘it reduced your chances of going to the hospital.’” Beal then paused and shook his head before continuing: “It doesn’t eliminate anybody from getting COVID, right?”
It’s not clear what Beal meant by shaking his head after saying if the vaccine reduces your chances of going to the hospital. (See chart below, “COVID-19-associated Hospitalizations Among Unvaccinated and Fully Vaccinated.”)
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since delta became the most common variant, unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated Americans are 4.5 times more likely to become infected, 10 times more likely to require hospitalization, and 11 times more likely to die due to COVID-19 than fully vaccinated Americans. Beal’s wife, Kamiah Adams-Beal, tweeted in January, “Yalllll go right ahead and play around with that vaccine if you want to.” In a separate Instagram post, she seemed to imply that baseball legend Hank Aaron’s death earlier this year was caused by the vaccine.

70,Instagram Post Makes Invalid Comparison Between COVID-19 and Flu Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-instagram-post-makes-invalid-comparison-between-covid-19-and-flu-vaccines/,,"A tweet shared on Instagram baselessly claims that a person is 300 to 900 times more likely to die “after getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine.”  But the comparison is faulty — and there is no proof that people are dying from COVID-19 vaccines.

A Feb. 15 tweet, subsequently shared on Instagram, cites unvetted information submitted to a federal database to baselessly claim that COVID-19 vaccines are significantly more dangerous than influenza vaccines. Experts, however, say that’s a misuse of the numbers — and the suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are killing one in every 10,000 immunized people is groundless.
“How much more likely are you to die after getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine?” the tweet, from novelist and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, begins.
“300-900 times, based on federal VAERS reports. Yes, 900,” he answers, referring to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, adding that for COVID-19 vaccines, it’s “1 death reported per 35,000 shots or 10,000 completed vaccinations (so far),” but for flu “1 death per 9,000,000 vaccinations.”
“That’s a safe vaccine,” Berenson then says of the flu vaccine. “Those deaths are likely coincidental, a simple result of the number of shots given. The #Covid vax, not so much.”
But Berenson’s analysis relies on the fallacy that any death that occurs after vaccination must be related to the vaccine.
“VAERS does not determine death, period,” a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us. “Just because somebody reports death doesn’t mean that the vaccine caused the death. So we don’t use VAERS to determine death rates or anything concerning death.”
In terms of the number of death reports following each vaccine at the time of his tweet, Berenson’s numbers check out. The CDC, for example, had written on its website that as of Feb. 7, 1,170 deaths had been reported to VAERS following the administration of 41 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. That’s around one report per 35,000 doses. (The number listed on the website is now 934 death reports out of 52 million doses, through Feb. 14; a CDC spokesperson said the decline is because the agency switched to include only domestic reports to match the number of doses administered in the U.S.)
But the comparison to flu is problematic, and the conclusion that COVID-19 vaccines are therefore unsafe is unfounded. 
Reports through VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused the adverse event, as anyone can submit reports, regardless of whether an immunization is thought to have contributed. When deaths following receipt of a vaccine are reported, CDC and Food and Drug Administration physicians review those cases — and so far with the COVID-19 vaccines, there has been no link with immunization.
A CDC spokesperson told us that to date, the agency has not received confirmation of a single COVID-19 vaccine-related death. 
Update, May 19: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says “women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.” As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see “Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.” 
Moreover, experts said it’s not surprising that more death reports would be submitted to VAERS after COVID-19 immunizations compared with flu, given the increased attention on the vaccine.
“The difference in deaths reported following COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine administration is likely due to the enhanced reporting of all events occurring after COVID vaccination compared to after influenza vaccination,” Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who also evaluates vaccines, told us.
Berenson, who frequently appears on conservative media, has previously misinterpreted a study to suggest that face masks are ineffective against the novel coronavirus. His tweets have formed the basis of another misleading claim online, also citing VAERS data, about adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines relative to flu vaccines.
Understanding VAERS
To understand why Berenson’s scary-seeming statistics should not be alarming, it’s useful to know how VAERS works and the limitations of its data.
As its website explains, VAERS is an early warning system that “is not designed to detect if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring a closer look.”
The system accepts any report of a reaction that occurs after an immunization. There is no screening or vetting of the report and submissions are accepted “without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.” A disclaimer users must read before accessing the public data therefore warns that reports “may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information,” and notes that the utility of the data is limited because most reporting is voluntary.
The information is still valuable because it’s a way of being quickly alerted to a potential safety problem with a vaccine, which government scientists can then investigate. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, VAERS is just one of several vaccine safety monitoring systems the government has in place to ensure the safety of the vaccine as it’s rolled out to a wider population.
But VAERS data isn’t meant to allow safety comparisons between vaccines or to arrive at any sort of estimate of a person’s chances of dying following an immunization. Indeed, the disclaimer specifically cautions against doing the kind of math Berenson performs. “The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines,” it reads.
Instead, a CDC spokesperson said, when a serious adverse event such as death is reported, the agency collects information, including medical records, autopsy reports, death certificates — and a qualified physician determines the cause of death.
“We look for patterns, we look for warning signals — but we do not use VAERS to determine death or death rates,” she said. “Those have to be verified.”
Increased Reporting for COVID-19 Vaccines
Given the way that VAERS works, there are several reasons why there would be more reports of death following a COVID-19 vaccine in the system than for influenza vaccines — none of which would have anything to do with the vaccine’s actual safety profile.
“There’s a heightened awareness of this virus, and hence, heightened awareness of this vaccine,” said Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee reviewing COVID-19 vaccines. 
The COVID-19 vaccines, too, have initially “been geared toward an older population that is more likely to have medical problems,” he said. Because the vaccines protect against COVID-19 but were “not designed to prevent everything else that happens in life,” Offit said, it’s expected that some number of people — especially the elderly — will die, entirely coincidentally, after receiving a vaccine. (SciCheck has addressed this before in “Video Makes Bogus Claims About ‘War Crimes’ and COVID-19 Vaccine Safety.”)
The CDC told us that reports of deaths occurring after COVID-19 immunization are under investigation, but that from the data thus far, “it appears many of these deaths are among nursing home residents who had serious underlying conditions and death was not hastened by the vaccination.”
Atmar, of Baylor, who has made recommendations about influenza vaccines as part of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also said that it’s a mistake to overinterpret the VAERS death reports.
“Persons with underlying conditions and living in nursing homes/long-term care facilities die of their underlying conditions on a daily basis,” he said in an email. During flu season, those deaths are unlikely to be reported to VAERS because they are not thought to be related to the flu vaccine, he explained. But with COVID-19, whether or not a death is thought to be due to the vaccine or a person’s medical condition, the deaths are being reported to VAERS.
“This ‘biased’ differential in reporting makes it appear that there is a difference in [the] death rate among recipients of the two types of vaccines,” he said. “Instead, what it represents is a difference in reporting.”
Because COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an emergency use authorization, there are in fact different reporting requirements to VAERS for the vaccines than for others. As is explained on the VAERS website, health care providers are required to report all deaths that occur after a COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of the suspected cause. 
With other vaccines, providers are encouraged to submit reports of death following vaccination, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause, but they are not required to do so unless the death occurs following a so-called reportable event for the vaccine, such as an allergic anaphylactic reaction.",Jessica McDonald,2021-02-19 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Yes, 900,” he answers, referring to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, adding that for COVID-19 vaccines, it’s “1 death reported per 35,000 shots or 10,000 completed vaccinations (so far),” but for flu “1 death per 9,000,000 vaccinations.”
“That’s a safe vaccine,” Berenson then says of the flu vaccine. (SciCheck has addressed this before in “Video Makes Bogus Claims About ‘War Crimes’ and COVID-19 Vaccine Safety.”)

71,The RNC’s Misleading Message About the Bidens,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/the-rncs-misleading-message-about-the-bidens/,,"A voicemail message being left at the homes of voters in Pennsylvania and elsewhere by the Republican National Committee makes a number of misleading claims about presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter and Trump’s handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The phone message, which repeatedly refers to President Donald Trump’s rival as “Beijing Biden,” says: “Beijing Biden’s son Hunter penned a $1.5 billion deal with a Chinese investment fund to make $80,000 per month from China in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.”
That’s wrong in some respects and misleading in others. As we and others have written, Hunter Biden was involved in the formation of a private equity fund with Chinese firms. But that deal, as the Wall Street Journal reported at the time, occurred in 2014 – long before the current pandemic. The call also leaves the misleading impression that Hunter Biden may have earned $1.5 billion as part of that deal, but the dollar amount is a reference to the new fund’s $1.5 billion investment goal for 2014.
There is no support for the call’s claim that Hunter Biden made “$80,000 per month from China in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak.”
The message ends with the assertion that Trump’s “first priority is the health and safety of the American people, not his family’s pocketbook.”
We asked an RNC spokesman for information supporting its claims about Hunter Biden but never heard back from him.
The Trump campaign and its allies have long criticized the Bidens over Hunter’s business dealings in China and Ukraine while his father was vice president. But, in both cases, there’s no evidence that either Biden did anything illegal or that the former vice president used his office to enrich his son, as we have written.
Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, from April 2014 to April 2019, and he stepped down from the board of BHR Partners, the Chinese equity fund, in October 2019.
George Mesires, Hunter Biden’s attorney, said of the RNC call: “This is false. Hunter Biden resigned from the BHR board of directors in October 2019, and the board position was unpaid. Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR’s board of directors nor has he received any return on his investment, which was a commitment to contribute approximately $420,000, not $1.5 billion.”
The RNC message, which presents itself as an “important update on President Trump’s response to COVID-19 and how it saved Americans’ lives,” repeats other unsupported claims that Trump has frequently made before.
The message asserts that the China travel restrictions the Trump administration implemented on Feb. 2 “saved millions of lives.” When we looked into this previously, we found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries imposed on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
As we’ve written, it’s possible the U.S. travel restrictions on China had some impact in slowing the importation of cases, but we don’t have evidence of that, or of how large the impact might be.
After the mention of the travel restrictions, the message says, “Beijing Biden accused President Trump of hysteria, xenophobia and fearmongering before finally agreeing with President Trump’s decision in April.” It’s true that Biden said that about Trump and that he endorsed the travel restrictions in April. But it is misleading to connect the two.
As we have reported, on Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced, Biden, while campaigning in Iowa, said that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.” He added, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.”
In his remarks that day, Biden didn’t mention the travel restrictions — which prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S., with exceptions for legal permanent residents and immediate family members — so it’s unclear what he meant when he criticized Trump’s “hysterical xenophobia.” The Biden campaign told us the candidate wasn’t referring to the travel rules, but rather to what it called Trump’s “long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.”
On April 3, the Biden campaign said its candidate backed the travel restrictions.
The references to “Beijing Biden” reflect the Trump campaign’s efforts, through a number of advertisements, to portray the former vice president as unduly close to China. We reported previously on some misleading aspects of one of the ads. And while it is true that Biden has said quite positive things about China and its people, so, too, has Trump. For example, on Jan. 22 the president tweeted, “One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA & China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country.”
In recent weeks, however, Trump has been critical of China for failing to do more to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. For example, at a coronavirus task force briefing May 11, Trump said, “I’m not happy with China. They should’ve stopped this at the source.”
Michael Joyce, a spokesman for the RNC, said the organization leaves a message when it calls voters and no one answers. He said the message varies in different parts of the country. He couldn’t say precisely where this one was being used, but said it was likely being used in states that, such as Pennsylvania, haven’t had their primaries yet. Pennsylvania, where we know this message was left, has its primaries on June 2.
To sum up: It’s perfectly fair for the RNC to criticize Biden’s policies on China. But to suggest, without evidence, that those policies were influenced by his “family’s pocketbook” is off base.

72,"COVID-19 Cases and Deaths, By the Numbers",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/covid-19-cases-and-deaths-by-the-numbers/,,"Noting that the United States accounts for about one-quarter of global COVID-19 cases and deaths, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. has “the worst record of any country in the world.” While the U.S. has the most confirmed cases and deaths by a wide margin, it does not have the most in either category on a per-capita basis.
Pelosi emphasized the U.S. share of coronavirus-related cases and deaths during a June 28 interview on ABC’s “This Week” in which she argued the Trump administration is not taking the growing outbreak in several U.S. states seriously.
“We are 4% of the world’s population,” the Democratic leader told host George Stephanopoulos. “We are 25% of the cases and the deaths, 25%. We have the worst record of any country in the world. And the president says we’re making progress or whatever.”
Pelosi got the percentages right, but where the U.S. ranks in dealing with the pandemic depends on how one looks at the numbers.
Total Confirmed Cases
Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, confirmed to FactCheck.org in an email that the congresswoman labeled the U.S. the “worst” based on it “having the most coronavirus deaths and confirmed cases of any country.”
According to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data, as of June 28, the day Pelosi made her claim, there were 9.95 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and 2.51 million, or 25%, of those cases were in the U.S — the most of any nation.
The U.S. total was 1.2 million cases more than the second-highest country, Brazil, which had 1.31 million cases as of that day.

Confirmed Cases Per Capita
But the U.S. did not have the most cases per capita — which takes into account a country’s population.
As of June 28, the U.S. had 7,584 confirmed cases per 1 million people, which was fewer cases than nine other nations, including Chile (14,007.27), Kuwait (10,394.65) and Peru (8,370.44). Qatar, which has an estimated population of almost 3 million, had the most cases per capita — 32,509.91 per 1 million people.

Total Confirmed Deaths
Based on the raw numbers, the U.S. also led all countries with 125,539, or 25%, of the 498,521 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, as of June 28 — according to Our World in Data figures. Brazil again was second to the U.S. with 57,070 confirmed deaths.

Confirmed Deaths Per Capita
Per capita, however, the U.S. — with 379.27 confirmed deaths per 1 million people — had fewer fatalities from COVID-19 than eight other nations.
Among those countries with more confirmed deaths per capita: Belgium (839.72), the United Kingdom (640.99), Italy (574.18), Sweden (522.81) and France (456.20).

Case Fatality Rate
In addition, the U.S. had a lower COVID-19 case fatality rate than several nations. The case fatality rate is the number of confirmed deaths divided by confirmed cases.
As of June 28, the U.S. rate was 5% — lower than the rate in dozens of other countries.

According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, out of the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the U.S., as of June 30, has the fifth highest observed case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 and the second highest per-capita death rate.
Pelosi’s claim, that the U.S. has fared the worst based on its total confirmed cases and deaths, reminded us of President Donald Trump’s claims that the U.S. leads the world in testing for COVID-19 simply based on the number of tests performed.
In Trump’s case, we also pointed out that because of the large U.S. population, a per-capita comparison would be a better gauge of countries’ testing efforts. By that measurement, we found the U.S. trailed at least a dozen countries in testing for the disease, as of May 9, and it’s still not leading the world.
Pelosi no doubt has a point about the large number of confirmed cases and deaths in the U.S. — and it is in no way our intention to minimize the seriousness of the situation.
But, similar to Trump’s boasts on testing, whether the U.S. has the “worst record” – as Pelosi said — also depends on the metric used.

73,Trump Falsely Suggests Pennsylvania Is Making ‘No Effort’ to Reopen,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-falsely-suggests-pennsylvania-is-making-no-effort-to-reopen/,,"5At a May 11 press conference, President Donald Trump falsely suggested that Pennsylvania was making “no effort” to reopen its economy, which was largely shut down by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
In fact, the state is in the midst of a phased reopening. Restrictions have been eased although by no means eliminated in 24 counties, and will be relaxed in another 13 on May 15. The remaining 30 counties are under a stay-at-home order through June 4, and no timetable has been released for when that will change.
Trump singled out Pennsylvania at a Rose Garden press conference when asked, “how do you respond to criticism that you’re also motivated by politics to try to grow the economy ahead of the election?”
Trump, May 11: Well, I think that if you look at Pennsylvania, as an example; if you look at various other states — I won’t get into them — the people want to go back. The numbers are getting to a point where they can, and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue states to get back into gear. And the people aren’t going to stand for it; they want to get back. They’re not going to stand for it. They want our country open.
On April 16, Trump unveiled guidelines for reopening the states but said he would leave it up to individual governors to “call your own shots” on how they did so, based on local circumstances. However, he hasn’t hesitated to call them out if he has problems with their approaches, as his comments about Pennsylvania show. With unemployment soaring and the election less than six months away, Trump has frequently expressed eagerness to get the economy restarted.
Pennsylvania is a swing state that could play an important role in determining whether Trump wins reelection. His upset victory there in 2016 was a significant element in Trump’s triumph.
In Pennsylvania, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, on March 16 extended a shutdown order to the entire state. Previously, such orders had been in place for counties in the Philadelphia area that had the highest number of cases in the state.
The state, which has the fifth largest population in the U.S., had 57,154 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (sixth highest) and 3,731 deaths (fifth highest) as of May 12, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On April 22, Wolf announced a gradual reopening plan under which restrictions would be eased in counties around the state as conditions improve.
The state’s color-coded plan spells out three phases: red, yellow and green. The red phase, still in place for much of the state, is the one featuring the stay-at-home order. Large gatherings are prohibited; restaurants and bars are limited to take-out and delivery service, and people are encouraged to travel only for life-sustaining purposes. Schools and most child-care facilities are closed.
In the yellow phase, the restrictions are eased somewhat but some remain in place. Stay-at-home orders are lifted. Retail businesses are permitted to reopen, although curbside pickup and delivery are still encouraged. Child-care centers can open. While some gatherings are permitted, those with more than 25 people are prohibited. Bars and restaurants are still limited to take-out and delivery. Gyms and nail salons remain shuttered. Schools remain closed.
As of May 8, 24 counties — many of them rural counties in northern and western Pennsylvania — moved to the yellow phase.
“These counties were deemed ready to move to a reopening – or yellow phase – because of low per-capita case counts, the ability to conduct contact tracing and testing, and appropriate population density to contain community spread,” the governor’s office said in a press release.
The statement said the decision was guided by a “risk-based decision support tool” developed by the state in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
On May 8, Wolf announced that 13 more counties, largely in western Pennsylvania, would move to the yellow phase on May 15.
In the populous Philadelphia region in southeastern Pennsylvania, no restrictions have been eased. None of the counties has reached the state’s target of having fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per 100,000 population in the last 14 days.
The Pennsylvania approach seems to be in line with federal guidelines, which call for a “downward trajectory” of cases over a 14-day period before reopening.
In the green phase, life pretty much returns to a new normal, or post-pandemic normal.
As in other states, the Pennsylvania shutdown order has sparked protests. In recent weeks a number of county officials said they simply plan to ignore the order. In response, Wolf has threatened to withhold federal coronavirus recovery aid from the defiant counties.
So, Pennsylvania is by no means fully open for business. But Trump was wrong to suggest that it has made “no effort” to restart its economy.

74,Trump’s False Claim That Michigan Is ‘Closed’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trumps-false-claim-that-michigan-is-closed/,,"In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the state of Michigan is “closed,” specifically and falsely mentioning churches and schools.
In fact, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and a frequent target of Trump, lifted the state’s stay-at-home order on June 1. The vast majority of the state’s businesses are open with some restrictions, as are churches and schools, although some of the latter are teaching remotely.
Trump’s comments came on the day the federal government charged six men with conspiring to kidnap Whitmer. The governor’s coronavirus restrictions had triggered vehement disapproval and led to demonstrations by armed protesters at the state Capitol in Lansing in April and May.
Trump, Oct. 8: And she keeps her state closed, although we just won the big case, as you know, to open up Michigan, because what she’s doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed.
Trump returned to the theme at a virtual telerally he held for Michigan voters two days later.
Trump, Oct. 10: Uh, your governor has to open up her state. We, uh, as you know brought suit, and now. … And she lost the suit on a constitutional basis. Get your kids back to school. Uh, we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. And we’ve done a really good job on it, and you’ll see that very soon when the vaccines start coming out, and the final therapeutics.
Whitmer issued her stay-at-home order on March 23 in an effort to stem the state’s rising tide of COVID-19 cases. The order told residents to stay home, although there were a number of exemptions, and said that nonessential workers should not report to work and telework if possible. Whitmer lifted the order on June 1, although some businesses — including gyms, hair salons and theaters — remained shuttered. Whitmer has issued several orders on the subject.
A number of other restrictions have remained in effect, including limits on crowd size at gatherings. But some have been lifted. For example, last month Whitmer issued an executive order allowing movie theaters and bowling alleys to reopen effective Oct. 9, although with stringent restrictions on crowd size. (Gyms and salons had reopened earlier, in June.)
The New York Times, which monitors what’s open and what’s closed in all 50 states during the pandemic, lists nearly everything as open in Michigan, including retail stores, industries and houses of worship. The only thing it lists as shut down is indoor service at bars.
But even that is no longer the case. According to the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services on Oct. 9: “There are no longer bar closures, but bars may only serve alcohol to gatherings seated at tables.”
As is true in many states, the situation in Michigan schools is a mixed bag, often dependent on local conditions. Some districts have students in class, while others have opted for remote learning. And some schools that opened up had to close in the face of flare-ups of COVID-19.
In August, Whitmer and legislative leaders reached a bipartisan agreement under which local school districts would determine their plans for reopening.
As for places of worship, a few days after issuing her initial stay-at-home order in March, Whitmer added language stating that “[a] place of religious worship is not subject to penalty” for exceeding restrictions on crowd size.
Despite the exemption, a group of churches filed a suit in May claiming Whitmer’s order violated religious freedom. The lawsuit sought to further exempt worshippers traveling to services from being subject to penalties. Two days after filing the suit, the churches put it on hold after Whitmer added language saying the exemption applied not just to places of religious worship but also to people attending and traveling to and from the services.
The situation in Michigan was complicated on Oct. 2 when the Michigan Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the 1945 law that Whitmer had relied on in issuing her emergency orders on COVID-19. Undeterred, Whitmer blasted the narrow 4-3 decision by the court’s four Republican justices. Whitmer noted that the decision would not go into effect for 21 days. After that, she said, the rules on masks and crowd size would continue “under alternative sources of authority that were not at issue in today’s ruling.”
After the ruling, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, like Whitmer a Democrat, said Oct. 4 that she would no longer enforce Whitmer’s emergency orders through criminal prosecutions. A statement issued by her press secretary, Ryan Jarvi, also said: “However, her decision is not binding on other law enforcement agencies or state departments with independent enforcement authority. It’s her fervent hope that people continue to abide by the measures that Governor Whitmer put in place — like wearing face masks, adhering to social distancing requirements and staying home when sick — since they’ve proven effective at saving lives. … We can respect both the court’s decision and the advice of medical experts by continuing with these important measures voluntarily.”
In the wake of the ruling, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services, citing authority not covered by the state Supreme Court ruling, issued an emergency order replicating several aspects of Whitmer’s orders. They include requiring wearing masks at indoor and outdoor gatherings; limiting the size of crowds at indoor and outdoor gatherings, with some exceptions; and requiring bars to close indoor common areas. The crowd-size limits mirror those Whitmer had imposed and also exempt religious services.
For indoor gatherings of between 10 and 500 people, crowd size is restricted to 20% of normal capacity. Outdoor gatherings of between 10 and 1,000 people are allowed at venues with fixed seating at up to 30% of normal capacity and at 30 people per 1,000 square feet at venues without fixed seating.
Whitmer came under fire from Trump in April over her coronavirus restrictions. The president took to referring to the first-term governor, who was interviewed as a possible Democratic vice presidential nominee, as “‘Half’ Whitmer” and ”the woman in Michigan.” On April 17, he tweeted, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!”
After news of the kidnapping plot against Whitmer surfaced, the governor said Trump was “complicit” because the president hadn’t sufficiently condemned white supremacist groups. Trump campaign official Jason Miller fired back by assailing Whitmer for “the fact that she wakes up every day with such hatred in her heart towards President Trump.”
Rhetoric aside, Michigan is not “closed,” as Trump claimed.

75,"Fake Coronavirus Cures, Part 2: Garlic Isn’t a ‘Cure’",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/fake-coronavirus-cures-part-2-garlic-isnt-a-cure/,,"1KQuick Take
Online posts have claimed to reveal various “cures” for the new coronavirus. Some are benign, like eating boiled garlic, while others are potentially dangerous, like drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach. Neither will cure the virus.

Full Story
Treatments billed as miracle cures have cropped up across the internet since the new coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, at the end of December.
One rumor claims that consuming garlic will treat the illness, which the World Health Organization has now named COVID-19. Another says loading up on vitamin C will do the trick. Yet another would have people, essentially, drink bleach. None of these will treat or cure the virus.
We’re addressing each of these claims in separate articles. Here, we examine the claim that boiled garlic will “cure” the virus.
A recipe circulating on social media is spreading this false information: “Good news, Wuhan’s corona virus can be cured by one bowl of freshly boiled garlic water. Old Chinese doctor has proven it’s efficacy.  Many patients has also proven this to be effective. Eight (8) cloves of chopped garlics add seven (7)cups of water and bring to boil.,  Eat and drink the boiled garlic water, overnight improvement and healing. Glad to share this.”
More important than the typos in the post is the bogus claim that consuming garlic can treat a virus that has killed 1,018 people, as of Feb. 11.
There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments that are recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients, however, can receive supportive care to treat their symptoms.
But the claim about garlic has spread widely enough that the WHO knocked it down, saying on a webpage dedicated to rumors about the virus: “Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.”
Garlic has a reputation for being antimicrobial and antiviral, according to a systematic review cited by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, which researches alternative medicine. But that review included only one trial and found that there was insufficient evidence that garlic could prevent or treat a common cold, according to the NCCIH.
It is generally safe to eat garlic in the amount usually found in food, according to the NCCIH. But garlic supplements could increase the risk of bleeding for those taking blood thinners, and garlic can interfere with the effectiveness of some drugs. The center recommends consulting a doctor before using alternative medicines.

76,"Trump, Hahn Mischaracterize Data on COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/trump-hahn-mischaracterize-data-on-covid-19-convalescent-plasma/,,"In a hyped press briefing the eve of the Republican National Convention, President Donald Trump falsely said that convalescent plasma had been “proven to reduce mortality by 35%,” even though the therapy has not yet been shown to be effective for COVID-19.
Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn also mischaracterized the data, inaccurately saying that a relative mortality decrease of 35% between those given high- versus low-concentration plasma meant that administering plasma would save 35 out 100 people sickened with COVID-19. That’s not right, and exaggerates the observed effect.
The administration’s inaccurate and imprecise summary of the existing data on convalescent plasma occurred in a Sunday night press briefing that Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany billed as revealing “a major therapeutic breakthrough” for the coronavirus.
The press conference was held one day after Trump alleged, baselessly, that the “deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA” was making it hard for companies to test COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in an effort to delay results until after the Nov. 3 election. There is no evidence for such a claim. 
Convalescent plasma, which dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic, refers to isolating the liquid portion of blood from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, which may contain antibodies that could help sick patients better fight off the virus.
In announcing that the FDA was issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 — a decision that days before, the New York Times reported had been put on hold after other federal health officials thought the data was too weak — Trump claimed that the therapy had “an incredible rate of success” and that a Mayo Clinic study had “proven” that it worked. 
Trump, Aug. 23: We’ve provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35%. …The FDA, MIT, Harvard and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease. Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.
In fact, the FDA did not determine that convalescent plasma is “safe and very effective,” as few randomized controlled trials exist, making its true efficacy unknown. Instead, the agency decided that the totality of the evidence supports the idea that plasma “may be effective in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19,” and that it is reasonable to think that the potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks.
Those risks include “allergic reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and transfusion associated lung injury, as well as the potential for transfusion-transmitted infections,” the FDA said in a press release announcing the EUA.
The FDA’s clinical memorandum emphasizes that additional research is still needed, writing, “Adequate and well-controlled randomized trials remain necessary for a definitive demonstration of [COVID-19 convalescent plasma] efficacy and to determine the optimal product attributes and appropriate patient populations for its use.” 
The memo further explains that there are public results for only two randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 — one in Wuhan, China, and another in the Netherlands. Neither identified a statistically significant clinical improvement, although both trials were small and terminated early, and therefore may have missed the opportunity to detect a meaningful clinical benefit.
Previously, patients could obtain convalescent plasma through one of three pathways, including the expanded access program, which is what led to the Mayo Clinic study. Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that with the EUA, hospitalized patients can now receive plasma outside of those programs — “just like any other prescription drug, so long as it is provided within the terms of the EUA.”
Initially in the briefing, Hahn was more circumspect in his description of the data on convalescent plasma, saying that agency scientists concluded that “COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy.”
But in explaining the Mayo Clinic results, he neglected to mention that the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo — and that the so-called 35% mortality benefit was in a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.
“In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients … treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers,” Hahn said, referring to the concentration of antibodies in the plasma, “there was a 35% improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.”
He then proceeded to incorrectly cast the finding as an absolute mortality benefit.
“So let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35% improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit,” Hahn continued. “What that means is — and if the data continue to pan out — 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.”
When pressed by a reporter and asked directly whether he was saying convalescent plasma was a promising treatment or had been shown to be effective, Hahn dodged the question — and let the misleading interpretation of the study stand.
“So I would say that a 35 — if you’re one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it,” he said, “this is pretty significant for that person and their family.”
As we’ll explain, the 35% figure is a relative number, reflecting how much better patients who were given high titer plasma fared compared with those given low titer plasma. It does not mean that if the results hold that 35 people out of 100 would be saved by plasma. That would be an absolute mortality benefit, or the proportion of patients who avoid death because of the therapy.
In this case, the study did not test plasma against a placebo, so it cannot provide that information, although the absolute mortality reduction of giving concentrated plasma rather than low-concentration plasma, at least as reported in the preprint, is just 4.8% — meaning that fewer than five extra patients in 100 would survive as a result.
But even more critically, that particular result was drawn from a subset of participants and does not come from a randomized controlled trial, so it’s not definitive — and doesn’t settle the question of whether convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19.
Hahn has since apologized for his flawed description of the Mayo Clinic results.
“I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma,” he said in an Aug. 24 tweet. “The criticism is entirely justified.  What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction.”
And in an Aug. 25 interview on “CBS This Morning,” Hahn said, “I personally could have done a better job and should have done a better job at that press conference explaining what the data show regarding convalescent plasma.”
Mayo Clinic Study
The Mayo Clinic study reports the results of more than 35,000 patients in the U.S.’s Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma. Rather than assigning people to either receive plasma or not, as would happen in a randomized placebo-controlled trial, the investigators followed the outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were given plasma at nearly 2,000 sites across the country. 
To get a sense of whether the treatment worked, researchers then analyzed the data to see whether patients were less likely to die if they received the plasma earlier in their disease course, or, in a subset of patients for whom their plasma was evaluated for antibodies, whether those who got plasma that was rich in antibodies survived better than those who received less concentrated plasma.
Overall, the data point to convalescent plasma being beneficial for COVID-19. According to the preprint, 8.7% of patients who received plasma within three days of diagnosis died within seven days, versus 11.9% of those who got it after four days or more. Similarly, the seven-day mortality rate was 8.9% for those who received the most concentrated plasma, compared with 13.7% for those who received the least concentrated plasma. That’s an absolute risk reduction of 4.8% and a 35% reduction in the relative mortality.
Still, as a Johns Hopkins University review notes, because of the study design, it’s not possible to tell from this work whether or not convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19. 
“[T]he cause of these differences in mortality may not be due to plasma therapy as the patients treated changed over time – were younger, healthier, less likely to have complications, and more likely to receive remdesivir later in the study – and the titer of antibodies transfused increased and the time to treatment also decreased over time,” the review reads. “This study highlights the need for randomized controlled studies to determine if there is a benefit for convalescent plasma for COVID-19.”
Mysterious 35% Relative Mortality Reduction
Trump and Hahn have emphasized the 35% mortality reduction from the Mayo Clinic study, but it’s worth noting that it’s based on a subset of patients. And it’s not even entirely clear which data produced the statistic.
As noted above, there is a 35% crude relative mortality reduction reported in the preprint at seven days for those who received high-concentration plasma versus low-concentration plasma. This number is based on 1,076 patients who received plasma that had been measured for antibody titers and met the cutoff parameters (see table 1).
But the preprint also shows a 35% relative decrease in mortality for high versus low concentration plasma at day seven when adjusted for potential confounding factors using a pooled relative risk estimate. That number is based on a total of 1,058 patients, approximately a third of whom were on a ventilator and a fifth of whom had “many” severe risk factors (see figure 3).
Previously, however, the FDA told the New York Times that the 35% statistic was based on other data from the Mayo Clinic study that the agency included in its EUA application — specifically a survival graph at 30 days for a subset of fewer than 1,300 patients who were younger than 80, were not on a ventilator and had received plasma within three days (see figure 3 on page 12).
Although the 35% is never written anywhere in the EUA application — and cannot be directly calculated because no exact numbers are provided — the Times estimated a 76% survival probability for patients receiving high-concentration plasma and a 63% survival probability for patients receiving low-concentration plasma from the graph, which works out to a 35% relative decrease in mortality.
Notably, Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University, who was one of the senior authors of the Mayo Clinic study, told the New York Times that he didn’t know where the 35% came from.
When we asked the FDA which specific data were used to make the 35% claim, the agency pointed us to Hahn’s “CBS This Morning” interview and promised to provide further information “when it is available.” We will update the story if we hear back. At this point, however, it remains unclear which information was used to generate the administration’s primary talking point.
Hahn’s Error
Regardless of the exact source, Hahn’s presentation of a 35% absolute mortality reduction, rather than a relative one, is incorrect. 
While this might seem to be a small error, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, told us that it wasn’t.
“THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE which is very basic,” he said in an email. “I want to give Dr. Steve Hahn the benefit of the doubt that he was speaking extemporaneously and flubbed something,” he added, but the difference in this case is “huge.” 
Indeed, if it is based on the preprint figure, that would mean Hahn exaggerated the effect of convalescent plasma sevenfold.
Boulware said he suspected that compared to no plasma, patients getting convalescent plasma probably are better off — but this remains an unanswered question. So are other critical questions, such as which patients benefit, which is especially important to know in deciding how to allocate a limited supply.
The Expanded Access Program, Boulware said, “was meant to be a short term bridge back in April. Yet tens of thousands of patients later, we don’t know what the benefit of plasma is.”
As for the EUA, Boulware said it “may” be warranted, but the hype beforehand was not — and that Hahn’s portrayal of a 35% absolute reduction in mortality was “deceptively misleading.”
While the administration claims the EUA will expand access of convalescent plasma, Boulware said it changes little other than the paperwork. “Plasma remains a scarce resource,” he said. “We use all the plasma locally that is available.”
More worryingly, Boulware thinks the EUA will make completing the necessary clinical trials more difficult to do. “People will want plasma which ‘saves 35% of people’s lives,’” he said, “and not enroll in randomized trials” in which patients may not be assigned to get the treatment. 
For his part, Casadevall, a senior author of the Mayo Clinic study, supports the EUA and believes it will help improve COVID-19 health inequities. 
“Plasma was already available in well resourced hospitals but understaffed hospitals caring for [underserved] populations struggled with the paperwork under the prior regs,” he said in an Aug. 24 tweet. “EUA makes usage easier.”
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the previous FDA commissioner under Trump, didn’t doubt that the EUA decision was science-based, but echoed the call for randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma.
“Plasma may provide a benefit, and it could be meaningful for certain patients, but we need more evidence to prove it,” he said in a tweet. “The data FDA had supports an authorization for emergency use, where the standard is ‘may be effective’ but we need better studies to confirm preliminary findings.”
After reviewing the published and unpublished evidence that underpinned the FDA’s EUA decision, the National Institute of Health’s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel issued a statement on Sept. 1 emphasizing the lack of available evidence on convalescent plasma.
“There are currently no data from well-controlled, adequately powered randomized clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19,” the statement reads, adding that the FDA’s analysis of a subset of patients from the Mayo Clinic found no overall benefit in survival at seven days among those given high- versus low-concentration plasma.
Rather, an effect was found only in patients who were not intubated, with 11% of patients given high-concentration plasma dying within a week compared with 14% of patients given low-concentration plasma — a 21% decrease in relative mortality.
“Although these data suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody titers may be beneficial in nonintubated patients, uncertainty remains about the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma due to the lack of a randomized control group and possible confounding,” the statement said. “Additionally, antibody levels in currently available COVID-19 convalescent plasma are highly variable, and assays to determine the effective antibody titers remain limited.”
The panel concluded that for now, there are “insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19.”
Update, Aug. 27: We added more information about how the EUA for COVID-19 convalescent plasma changes how patients can access the therapy.
Update, Sept. 3: We added the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel’s statement about the FDA’s EUA for convalescent plasma.

As for the EUA, Boulware said it “may” be warranted, but the hype beforehand was not — and that Hahn’s portrayal of a 35% absolute reduction in mortality was “deceptively misleading.”
While the administration claims the EUA will expand access of convalescent plasma, Boulware said it changes little other than the paperwork. “So I would say that a 35 — if you’re one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it,” he said, “this is pretty significant for that person and their family.”
As we’ll explain, the 35% figure is a relative number, reflecting how much better patients who were given high titer plasma fared compared with those given low titer plasma. “Additionally, antibody levels in currently available COVID-19 convalescent plasma are highly variable, and assays to determine the effective antibody titers remain limited.”
The panel concluded that for now, there are “insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19.”
Update, Aug. 27: We added more information about how the EUA for COVID-19 convalescent plasma changes how patients can access the therapy. “In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients … treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers,” Hahn said, referring to the concentration of antibodies in the plasma, “there was a 35% improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.”
He then proceeded to incorrectly cast the finding as an absolute mortality benefit. In this case, the study did not test plasma against a placebo, so it cannot provide that information, although the absolute mortality reduction of giving concentrated plasma rather than low-concentration plasma, at least as reported in the preprint, is just 4.8% — meaning that fewer than five extra patients in 100 would survive as a result."
77,Meme Featuring DeSantis Presents Misleading Picture of COVID-19 and Vaccine Safety,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-meme-featuring-desantis-presents-misleading-picture-of-covid-19-and-vaccine-safety/,,"
Some politicians and pundits have downplayed the severity of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. One such example has sprung up again, this time with an additional message aimed at spreading fear about the vaccines.
An Instagram account promoting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as former President Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024, if Trump seeks office again, has shared a photo of DeSantis from September. In it, the governor is holding a sign that shows “COVID-19 Survival Rates” by age group, which range from 99.997% for those under 20 to 94.6% for those over 70.
The new version altered the original image by adding text that says, “Do you really need that dangerous vaccine?” But that message isn’t from DeSantis, who has been vaccinated and has encouraged others to get vaccinated.
Both of those messages, though — highlighting the survival rates and questioning the safety of the vaccines — are misleading.
Misleading Comparison Minimizes Risk
We’ll start with the original claim about the high survival rates for COVID-19.
DeSantis used the sign at a September press conference during which he announced that he would lift restrictions meant to curb the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.
The sign read:
COVID-19 Survival Rates by Age Group
0-19: 99.997%

20-49: 99.98%

50-69: 99.5%

70+: 94.6%
Small print at the bottom of the sign attributed the numbers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC didn’t publish those numbers, Jasmine Reed, an agency spokeswoman, told us in an email.
Instead, the Florida Department of Health used the CDC’s estimated “infection fatality ratio” for those age groups from a Sept. 10 report called “COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios” to calculate “survival rates.”
It’s not wrong to figure out the survival rate that way, Dr. Julien Riou, a research fellow at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told us in an email. But in this case, the numbers are misleading.
Riou, who worked on the paper that the CDC cited for the estimated infection fatality rates, noted that the survival rate listed for those over 70 doesn’t reflect what the paper found. The survival rate for those between ages 70 and 79 would be about 95%, as the sign says, but the rate for those over 80 would be lower, about 70% to 80%, he said. That distinction wasn’t included in the CDC’s report either, though.
More importantly, focusing on the high survival rates minimizes the deadly toll that COVID-19 has already taken.
The fact is, more than 577,000 people nationwide have died of the disease, and COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020.
That’s “unbelievable,” Dr. Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview. “Here’s something that came out of the blue and ranked behind cancer and heart disease.”
While it’s true that the estimated infection fatality rates for COVID-19 are under 1% for most age groups, the disease is widespread, he said. So the actual impact — the total number of deaths — is significant. More than 3 million people worldwide have died of the disease.
“One percent of a few people is small, but 1% of a lot of people is large,” Vermund said. “That’s what we have here.”
Highlighting strong survival rates, as this meme does, gives people false confidence, he said. It also doesn’t account for cases of long COVID-19, which can cause symptoms to last for months and have severe impacts on patients’ lives.
The bottom line is that both things are true: The percentage of those who die from COVID-19 may appear low, but the raw number of those who have died is high, Vermund said. Focusing only on the relatively low percentage of deaths minimizes the issue.
Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines
We’ll now address the newer claim suggesting that the vaccines are unsafe.
As we’ve explained before, clinical trials found no serious safety concerns for the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S., and more than 246 million doses have been administered so far.
That said, there have been some rare but serious reactions to the vaccines.
A relatively small number of people had serious allergic reactions after getting the three vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. As we’ve written before, some allergic reactions, including a potentially life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis, are to be expected with any vaccine. Fortunately, that kind of severe reaction is very rare — about 2 to 5 per million — and “almost always occurs within 30 minutes after vaccination,” the CDC says, so it can be quickly treated.
In April, regulatory agencies recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine while they investigated reports of a rare but potentially fatal blood-clotting condition among women under 50 years old. The investigation confirmed 15 cases of the rare condition, including three deaths, out of nearly 8 million vaccine doses of the J&J vaccine, as of April 21. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration recommended resuming use of the shot with a warning of the rare, increased risk, explaining that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, and that the risk hasn’t been seen with the other authorized vaccines.
The obvious benefit of all these vaccines is that they reduce the rates of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. A recent government analysis in the U.K. estimated that vaccines there had prevented 10,400 deaths for those over 60 years old from December through March. During that time, more than 15 million vaccines were administered.
That works out to 693 deaths prevented per 1 million vaccine doses in the most vulnerable age group.
“We’ve seen the risks of COVID-19 — in individual health and public health,” Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health, told us in a phone interview. The risks of the disease, as we described above, are visible and significant. “That’s how we have to think about the risks of the vaccines,” he said, in terms of what they prevent.
“We know that the vaccines currently in use have been tremendously effective in preventing hospitalizations and death,” Schwartz said. “They all but eliminate the outcomes of COVID-19 that have been so catastrophic.”
The most common consequence of the vaccines are sore arms and short-term symptoms, with some very rare cases of allergic reaction or blood clots, he said, comparing that to the prevention of hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 made possible by the vaccines. It’s “literally a different level of magnitude,” Schwartz said.
(See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.“)",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-05-05 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Instead, the Florida Department of Health used the CDC’s estimated “infection fatality ratio” for those age groups from a Sept. 10 report called “COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios” to calculate “survival rates.”

78,Trump Reprises Inaccurate COVID-19 Comparisons with Europe,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trump-reprises-inaccurate-covid-19-comparisons-with-europe/,,"In a series of recent appearances, President Donald Trump continued to wrongly insist that the U.S. compares favorably with Europe on both coronavirus cases and deaths.
Trump falsely said that Europe’s COVID-19 outbreaks are “much worse” than those in America and that the U.S. has also done “much, much better” on coronavirus deaths, including by having a significantly lower excess mortality rate. While coronavirus cases are increasing in Europe, the U.S.’s per-capita rate is still higher, as is the best estimate of the excess mortality rate.
Trump has made inaccurate comparisons with Europe before, but in a Sept. 10 press briefing, two weekend campaign rallies in Nevada and a Sept. 15 televised town hall, the president continued to insist that the U.S. compares favorably with Europe on coronavirus cases and deaths.
“But if you look at the European Union right now, they’re having breakouts like you’ve never seen before,” he said at the briefing. “And, frankly, their numbers are at a level that are much worse than the numbers here.”
Three days later, at a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump focused again on Europe. “Other countries are doing terribly,” he said. “Did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries? Us compared to Europe?”
It’s true that many countries in Europe are experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases that now rivals or exceeds the number of cases those nations had in the spring. But only a few countries are posting more new cases per capita than the U.S. — and Europe’s rate is about half of America’s.
According to Oxford University’s Our World in Data, on Sept. 10, the U.S. reported a seven-day average of 106 new coronavirus cases per day per million people, compared with 59 for the European Union and 50 for Europe. 
Only Montenegro, Spain, Andorra, Moldova and France had higher rates of new cases — and at 112 cases per million, France’s rate was only slightly higher, not “much worse” as Trump claimed. Since Montenegro, Moldova and Andorra are not part of the E.U., that means only two E.U. nations, out of 27, had worse outbreaks than the U.S. when adjusted for population.
When measured cumulatively, only one European nation — the microstate of San Marino — has had more COVID-19 cases per capita than the U.S. As of Sept. 15, America has had 19,803 cases per million people, a rate 3.6 to 3.9 times that of Europe (5,546) and the E.U (5,094).
Mortality
Trump also gave inaccurate information about Europe’s COVID-19 mortality. When a reporter noted that many people have died in the U.S., Trump falsely claimed that “we have done much, much better than the European Union.”
“Yesterday, European nations experienced 50% more deaths than the United States,” Trump incorrectly said earlier in the briefing. “And you don’t hear these things. You don’t hear these statistics.”
In both Nevada rallies, the president also rolled out his previously debunked claim that Europe has a much higher excess mortality rate than the U.S.
“Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher,” Trump said on Sept. 12 to a crowd in Minden, Nevada. He repeated the same statistic at an indoor rally in Henderson the next day.
Trump doubled down on the claim in an ABC News town hall on Sept. 15. “The excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world,” he boasted. “I mean, I can show you. There’s a chart that just came out a little while ago, excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it’s about 25% better. In one case, it’s over 60% better.”
The White House did not explain what figure the president had in mind when he said Europe had “50% more deaths,” but we found that was false by several metrics.
Our World in Data shows that on Sept. 10, the U.S. had more new coronavirus deaths, whether adjusted for population or not, than both Europe and the E.U. The same was true when using the seven-day average of new deaths.
Using cumulative numbers on Sept. 10, Europe had more deaths than the U.S. on a raw basis, but only about 11% more — and when taking Europe’s larger population into account, the roles reverse. Per capita, America had 576 deaths per million people, 80% more than the E.U. (318) and 103% more than Europe (282).
On excess mortality, Trump previously claimed that Europe’s excess mortality rate was 33% or 40% higher than the U.S. Controversial Trump coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, who is a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, also has used 38% in interviews. This time, Trump used 24% and 25% — but the statistic is still wrong.
As we wrote earlier, excess mortality is an alternative way of estimating the impact of the coronavirus that looks at the actual number of deaths, regardless of cause, compared with a “normal” or expected number of deaths during a given time period.
Many of the deaths this past spring and summer may be due directly to COVID-19, but some may be due to indirect effects of the pandemic, such as those who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention.
Using updated sources since our last analysis, we found no evidence for Trump’s claim that Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% or 25% higher than America’s. We performed two calculations, the first comparing estimates of excess deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and EuroMOMO, a group monitoring mortality trends in Europe.
The CDC estimates that between Feb. 1 and Sept. 5, there have been 201,917 to 262,877 excess deaths in the U.S., for a middle estimate of 232,397 excess deaths. For 24 European countries or parts of countries, EuroMOMO estimates there have been 209,144 excess deaths through week 36, or Sept. 6.
When adjusted for population, those figures work out to show that the U.S. has had 704 excess deaths per million people, slightly more than the EuroMOMO region of Europe’s 680 excess deaths per million.
Because the EuroMOMO figures only cover a portion of Europe, for a better comparison, we also repeated our analysis using updated figures from the Human Mortality Database. We used data covering 2020 up until June 28 (week 26) because several countries had data only up until that point (Slovenia was once again excluded because it lacked data past week 13).
For that time period, Europe had 246,620 excess deaths, a 9.9% increase over the number of deaths the continent usually has. The U.S., meanwhile, had 194,936 excess deaths, which is 13.7% more than normal — meaning the American excess death rate is worse, not better, than Europe’s.
It’s possible Trump’s 24% and 25% figures come from a calculation based on the raw number of excess deaths for both places — using the numbers here, the sheer total for Europe is 26.5% higher than the U.S. The campaign did not respond to our query about where the statistic originated or how it was calculated, and the White House has also never provided additional information, despite repeated inquiries about the figure.
But if that’s the source of the statistic, it’s nevertheless a skewed and misleading portrait of excess mortality because Europe has a significantly larger population than the U.S. The best indicator to use is the P-score, or the percentage of excess deaths to “normal” deaths, and by that measure America’s 13.7% excess mortality rate is 38% higher than Europe’s 9.9% rate.
On a per-capita basis, Europe has had 509 excess deaths per million, compared with 590 in the U.S.
A few European countries do have worse excess mortality rates than the U.S., including Spain, which has the worst rate in the region. By the end of June, Spain’s mortality was 22.1% higher than normal, or 62% higher than America’s rate. But looking further out, through Aug. 23, Spain’s rate fell to 19.3%, or 42% higher than the U.S. As Spain is the most extreme example, Trump is cherry-picking this number — if that’s what he meant when he said in one case the U.S. is “over 60% better.”
These data once again do not support Trump’s claim that Europe as a whole has significantly more excess death in 2020 than America, and begin to bear out the predictions University of Oxford economists Janine Aron and John Muellbauer made in August, when they said they expected the numbers to worsen for the U.S. as time went on.
As they noted then, it’s premature to compare excess mortality given the ongoing pandemic, and it’s not entirely fair to relate the U.S. to Europe given America’s younger, less dense population.

79,Prank Posts Mislead on Direct Government Payments for Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/prank-posts-mislead-on-direct-government-payments-for-coronavirus/,,"Quick Take
The Trump administration has proposed a plan to provide direct payments to some U.S. citizens, beginning April 6, to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus. But a prank post circulating on Facebook falsely states that the government is sending out checks every week and claim forms are already available.

Full Story 
The Trump administration recently announced plans for a $1 trillion emergency stimulus package to alleviate economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic. According to a proposal by the Treasury Department, the funding includes loans to airlines and small businesses as well as direct payments to individuals.
The proposal states that the individual payments would come in two rounds, with a total of “$250 billion to be issued beginning April 6” and “$250 billion to be issued beginning May 18.” Each payment to individuals “would be fixed and tiered based on income level and family size.”
On March 19, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said adults would initially receive $1,000 and children $500 within three weeks, and a second payment of the same amount in six weeks if the economic disruption continues.
Details about these payments have not been finalized, and legislation still needs to be drafted and approved by Congress.
But a series of viral Facebook posts wrongly claim that the government is sending out hundreds of dollars per week to each U.S. citizen “starting from” either March 16 or March 17, depending on the post.
“All US Citizens are Entitled to $700 USD per week to stay at home to avoid the spread of COVID-19 novel Coronavirus, starting from March 17, 2020,” states one post, which has garnered more than 5,000 shares. “The Government grant pay is accessible to all no matter employment status.” 
The post, accompanied by a “BREAKING NEWS” visual, includes a link that supposedly allows people to “claim” their money. The link leads to a photo of a gorilla with its middle finger up — revealing that the post is a joke. The same picture was used as a prank in another series of misleading posts about workplace and school closings due to the coronavirus, which we reported in early March.
Many commenters understood that the recent posts weren’t accurate. But with the Trump administration’s proposal to give out direct payments in the future, it’s important to sort fact from fiction.
The Treasury Department proposal states that there will be two payments, not weekly checks, starting on April 6 and May 18. It does not detail how much money each individual will receive, stating only that the amount will be determined in part by “income level and family size.”
In a March 19 interview on “Mornings with Maria” on Fox Business, Mnuchin did provide dollar amounts for each of those payments — up to $1,000 for adults and $500 per child — but that is subject to negotiations with Congress before it can become law.
A day earlier, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech that “a single $1,000 check” isn’t enough.
Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27. Adults with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will receive $1,200 (married couples with an adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less will receive $2,400, plus $500 per child). The payment amount will scale down by income, phasing out at $99,000 for single individuals and $198,000 for couples without children.

80,How Many COVID-19 Tests Are ‘Needed’ to Reopen?,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/how-many-covid-19-tests-are-needed-to-reopen/,,"The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that there are enough COVID-19 tests for states to begin reopening their economies. While that may be true for select locations, experts say more tests are needed, even if they don’t agree on a particular number.
In the past couple of weeks, President Donald Trump and other members of the coronavirus task force have insisted that there are adequate levels of diagnostic testing for the coronavirus to allow states to lift stay-at-home orders and restart some businesses.
“We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening,” Trump said in an April 27 briefing, adding, “And the testing is not going to be a problem at all. In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.”
In the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said, “[W]e have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies.” Phase one refers to the first part of the White House’s plan for a gradual return to quasi-normal life, which allows gyms, restaurants and movie theaters, for example, to open under continued social distancing, but for schools to remain closed and workplaces to encourage telework where possible. 
The vice president’s office did not explain which metrics Pence and others were using to make that determination, so it’s hard to fully evaluate his statement. But while some places may have enough tests, multiple scientists told us that as a whole, the U.S. still lags behind what’s needed to execute an effective strategy to rein in outbreaks.
“Testing is still limited,” Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in response to Pence’s statement. 
“If you’re not including testing as a large part of phase one opening, then sure, we have plenty of tests,” he said. “But I think most of us who are working on thinking about what are the safest and best ways to open up the economy again place pretty significant amounts of testing front and center to prevent outbreaks and monitor for them.”
The question of how many tests it will take is hotly debated, with some groups recommending at least around half a million tests a day, and others suggesting several million or upwards of 20 million or even 35 million a day.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, testing for the coronavirus in the U.S. has steadily improved — to around 264,000 a day, on average over the past week, up from about 217,000 tests per day on average for the week ending on April 26. But the nation is still below any of the proposed benchmarks from experts.
Those figures also mean there aren’t enough tests for every American who wants to return to work to get one, as Trump suggested in a May 5 interview with ABC News. When asked whether “any worker who’s nervous about going back” would have access to both diagnostic tests for the virus and antibody, or serological tests, “right now,” Trump replied, “There should be no problem.”
But Yonatan Grad, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard, said the answer “is quite clearly no,” adding, “we don’t yet have the capacity to offer broadly either virologic or serologic testing.”
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told CNN’s Jake Tapper on April 28 that everyone who needs a test, “according to the way we’re approaching the identification, isolation, contact tracing, keeping the country safe and healthy,” should be able to get one by the end of May or the beginning of June.
“That’s what I’m being told by the people who are responsible for the testing,” he added. “I take them for their word.”
We’ll review several of the estimates and explain why testing is so important — but also why it’s not the only consideration for reopening businesses, schools and other places that have been largely closed for a month or more.
Wide Range of Estimates
Several groups have attempted to put a figure on how many tests are needed for the U.S. to reopen. On the lower end, researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute calculated that the U.S. would need to do approximately 500,000 tests per day, as a bare minimum, by May 1 — a figure they have since revised to 900,000 for May 15.
On the other extreme, there’s Nobel laureate and New York University economist Paul Romer’s plan to test the entire U.S. population once every two weeks, or around 25 million tests a day. He has since raised that to 35 million tests per day, or more, to include daily testing of front-line workers.
In between, Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics suggests 2 million tests per day to start, then ramping up to at least 5 million tests per day by early June to get the full workforce back in action — with that growing to as many as 20 million tests per day.
The 5-million-a-day figure has received perhaps the most attention, in part because when asked about the number on April 28, the president claimed the U.S. would hit that goal “very soon.”
That morning, however, Adm. Brett Giroir, who is in charge of the government’s COVID-19 testing efforts, told Time magazine that “there is absolutely no way on Earth, on this planet or any other planet, that we can do 20 million tests a day, or even five million tests a day.” 
A day later, Trump insisted that he had never made such a claim. “I think we will,” he said, referring to hitting the 5-million-per-day benchmark, “but I never said it.”
There isn’t a consensus on the number of tests, in part because the groups are making different assumptions and taking different approaches to tackling the pandemic on different timelines. Key to all of the strategies, however, is using testing to identify people who are infected so that they can be isolated and no longer spread the virus to others. 
Many public health experts endorse testing combined with contact tracing, which involves tracking down others with whom the infected person had contact, so that those people can be warned, and ideally be put into quarantine or be tested as well.
“Without ubiquitous testing — testing everyone with symptoms, and those they have come in contact with — we simply cannot be confident that a reported decline in cases represents a true decline in infections – and that it’s safe to open,” explained Ashish Jha, faculty director of Harvard Global Health Institute, or HGHI, and a co-author of the group’s estimates, in a Time editorial. “If a state misjudges its true underlying infection trajectory, it may suffer large flare-ups of the disease, necessitating a long and painful lockdown again.”
The HGHI estimates were calculated in two main ways. In the first, the team followed a strategy of testing everyone with flu-like symptoms and the contacts of those who test positive. Assuming that 1% of cases prove fatal, the group worked backward from a projected number of deaths to estimate the number of new infections in the U.S. on a given day, which for May 15, is about 100,000. To then approximate the number of tests, the group assumed that three-fourths of those people would have symptoms and be tested, and each person would have 10 contacts to trace.
Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher on the HGHI team, told us the team looked through the literature to determine the number of contacts, and ended up choosing a “middle-of-the-road estimate.”
Then the group added in the typical number of influenza-like illness cases for the season, reaching a total of around 900,000 tests per day. A similar calculation, based on trying to get the percentage of positive tests below 10% — in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization — produced a similar figure.
The researchers, however, caution that their approach in every way veers toward an undercount, and therefore should be viewed as a “floor, not a goal.”
“If we don’t ramp up our testing,” said Tsai, “we’re just condemned to repeating the mistakes of both February, March and April.”
The Harvard Safra figures, which were based on modeling efforts described in two white papers, assume an intensive testing, isolation and contact tracing approach.
Danielle Allen, the director of the center and co-author of the group’s April 20 report, told us the numbers were generated by aiming to have each infected person spread the disease to less than one other person (specifically 0.75 people), which would allow the outbreak to eventually fizzle out.
With just essential workers, or about 40% of the workforce in action, the group estimated the U.S. would need 2 million tests per day, rising to 5 million for 100% of the workforce.
“Both of these numbers depend on effective contact tracing,” Allen said. “If contact tracing is moderately effective the amount of testing needed rises to 20 million a day.”
Allen, however, said that with subsequent modeling, the group now thinks 5 million tests per day may be sufficient, and is planning to revise the numbers in a forthcoming report.
Two other groups, also adopting a contact tracing strategy, offer other testing benchmarks. The Rockefeller Foundation suggests an initial 3 million tests per week, or about 430,000 tests per day, by mid-June, then growing that number 10-fold over another six months.
Resolve to Save Lives, a public health initiative headed by former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, tallied up the number of highest-priority people who need tests, and came up with a lower bound number of 350,000 to 700,000 tests per day. This includes high-risk patients with COVID-19 symptoms and any sick hospital workers, public safety officers, prisoners, or nursing home residents and their symptomatic contacts.
“The minimum number of tests that need to be done per day,” the group’s report notes, “will depend on the stage of the epidemic and number of outbreaks, hospitalization rates, number of cases and contacts identified, and decisions about the frequency and extent of testing in nursing homes, hospitals, and essential services.”
If contact tracing is not part of the equation, even more tests are needed because the approach becomes an untargeted national surveillance method. Because diagnostic testing only reveals whether someone has detectable virus in their body at one point in time, tests must be given to pretty much everyone repeatedly to ensure those who are infected are aware and can be isolated. 
That’s how one arrives at the even higher figures, such as Romer’s 25-million-per-day goal. Instead of prioritizing people who are sick, as is being done now — and is recommended in the vast majority of proposals — Romer’s plan calls for tests to go first to people without symptoms to pick out those who are spreading the virus unwittingly.
State-Specific Thresholds
While most of the test estimates are for the entire country, the reality is that for any targeted testing strategy — which is the only strategy that’s currently possible — locations with relatively few infections won’t need as much testing as places with huge outbreaks.
“You can’t just take the national number and scale it to states by their population,” HGHI’s Jha told the health news website STAT, in a story sharing an updated state-by-state breakdown of the group’s original estimate. “You have to base it on the size of the outbreak in a state.”
The latest figures from HGHI show that just nine states, the majority of which are clustered in the sparsely-populated West, are close to or have surpassed their testing targets. The analysis also reveals that even states that have been performing a large number of tests per capita, such as Rhode Island and Massachusetts, are still short of their estimated minimums. Conversely, some states that have relatively low per-capita testing rates, such as Hawaii and Alaska, are exceeding their targets.
Because the estimates were made using a model that assumed states would stay locked down until May 15, the researchers caution that states could very well need more tests than their calculations suggest if social distancing measures are loosened.
“The moment you relax, the number of cases will start climbing,” Jha noted in the group’s write-up of the project. “And therefore, the number of tests you need to keep your society, your state from having large outbreaks will also start climbing.”
None of the other estimates provide state-level figures, although Allen said the Harvard Safra group plans to release another report breaking down its national numbers “to make visible what is necessary in high prevalence, low prevalence, and no prevalence locales.”
Test Positivity
Short of a specific test threshold, one metric experts say can get at whether a country or state is doing something close to enough testing is the test positivity rate.
Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told us that it’s “very difficult to say what the ‘right’ number” of tests is, but because a high fraction of tests are still positive, “it is clear we need more capacity.”
As a Johns Hopkins website explains, if a large proportion of tests are positive, that suggests a community is only able to test the sickest patients, and is likely missing people with milder infections who can still spread the disease.
The WHO has said that countries doing extensive testing see around 3-12% of tests come back positive, and has recommended that nations aim for or a test positivity of roughly 10% to make sure there’s enough testing happening to detect all of the cases. 
As of May 8, about 15% of all tests in the U.S. have been positive, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. In the last few days, the current test positivity rate has begun to dip below 10%, although many states have a significantly higher percentage of positive tests.
“I prefer positivity to numbers of tests or tests per capita because positivity is tied to the burden of disease in a location,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in an email.
Nuzzo noted, for example, that the U.S. has conducted around 10 times as many tests per capita as Taiwan, but the American epidemic is some 200 times bigger.
And she has concerns about many states that are thinking of or have already reopened. “[W]e’ve found that a number of these [states] aren’t doing enough testing and have too high positivities,” she said. “This makes me worried that they are missing the bottom of the iceberg in terms of infections and not seeing the full picture of illness in their communities.”
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, agreed that per-capita test numbers are “not as informative as looking at testing per positive infection identified.” 
The U.S., he said, has done only about six tests per confirmed case, whereas South Korea has done 60. “They’re testing 10 times as many per infection found,” he said in an interview.
This is especially relevant because Trump has frequently boasted of the total number of tests the U.S. has performed, and has suggested that the U.S. is outpacing South Korea and other nations. 
Speaking in Arizona on May 5, Trump said, “We’re over 7 million tests. Germany is at two and a half. Italy is less than that. Japan is down here and South Korea, which we talk about, and again, I’m very friendly with South Korea, and with the president of South Korea, and he calls to congratulate us on our great testing. South Korea is over here.”
Trump is correct that the U.S. has done more total testing, but all of the other countries he mentioned have still performed more tests per positive case, meaning they’ve been able to do more testing relative to the size of their outbreaks.
The next day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany again referenced South Korea. “We always hear about South Korea and their tests, there are 11 tests per thousand,” she said. “Here in the United States, that’s 17 tests per thousand.”
McEnany’s statistics are slightly off — for May 4, Our World in Data shows South Korea with 12 tests per thousand people and the U.S. with 22. 
But again, the comparison is misleading because it ignores the fact, as we have previously written, that South Korea rapidly expanded testing early on in the outbreak. Ultimately, the country was able to successfully halt its outbreak — something the U.S. has failed to do.
On May 8, the country posted just 12 new cases, while the U.S. is still seeing around 25,000 new infections per day, or approximately 325 times more cases than South Korea when adjusted for the population. It took months — until April 17 — for the U.S. to catch up to South Korea’s per-capita testing level, and the U.S. has yet to match the nation’s less than 2% test positivity rate. South Korea doesn’t need to compete with the U.S. on per-capita tests because the country is already doing a massive amount of testing compared to its caseload.
Contact Tracing
While experts say increased testing is a requirement for reopening, they also emphasize that by itself, it’s not enough.
“What’s more important now is not so much the testing number,” said HGHI’s Tsai. “It’s really the testing strategy and transparency around the goalposts as states come up with their specific plans for reopening.”
A key question is whether states will be able to snuff out new chains of viral transmission through contact tracing, as many experts advise. While a staple of public health, contact tracing is a resource-intensive process, and involves not just piecing together an infected person’s contacts, but also providing support to those who are quarantined or isolated.
“They may need food. They may need medicines,” said Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, on a call with journalists. “They may need help with simple things like doing their laundry.”
Gurley contributed to a report, written in collaboration with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, that estimated the U.S. would need to add around 100,000 contact tracers to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
While Shaman thinks contact tracing is absolutely critical, he noted that South Korea was exceptionally well set-up to make the technique more effective.
Following an outbreak of MERS in 2015, he said, the country passed laws that allowed the government to monitor people’s credit cards and phones — and also to arrest anyone refusing to participate in a quarantine.
Those levers aren’t available in the U.S., and privacy concerns may keep at bay proposals to deploy more scalable technology-based contact tracing tools.
Other scientists are pessimistic that contact tracing will work in the U.S., especially if case numbers remain high.
“It’s clear that you can do a lot of control if you do contact tracing really well. Singapore managed with mainly contact tracing for several months,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, in a call with reporters. “But then eventually even Singapore lost its control of the epidemic and had to resort to social distancing types of measures.”
“In conjunction with really aggressive measures to get case numbers down — and significant resources — contact tracing can be a useful piece of the control approach,” he added. “But I think it’s very challenging with an ongoing epidemic.”
According to a New York Times analysis, 21 states are planning to or have already begun to reopen, even though they have not cleared all of the criteria set forth by the White House guidelines. Most of the states do not meet the gating criteria for COVID-19 cases, which can be met by showing either a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period” or a “downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period.” 
Opening before states have solid testing infrastructures and strategies that they know are working, Tsai said, would be premature. “It’s basically just turning back the hands of time to February,” he said.

The Harvard Safra figures, which were based on modeling efforts described in two white papers, assume an intensive testing, isolation and contact tracing approach. The 5-million-a-day figure has received perhaps the most attention, in part because when asked about the number on April 28, the president claimed the U.S. would hit that goal “very soon.”

In the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said, “[W e have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies.” Phase one refers to the first part of the White House’s plan for a gradual return to quasi-normal life, which allows gyms, restaurants and movie theaters, for example, to open under continued social distancing, but for schools to remain closed and workplaces to encourage telework where possible. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told us that it’s “very difficult to say what the ‘right’ number” of tests is, but because a high fraction of tests are still positive, “it is clear we need more capacity.”

Trump falsely labeled COVID-19-related restrictions on flights into the U.S. from China and Europe as a “travel ban,” and falsely claimed the policies were put in place “very early.” A government study, for example, said the restrictions on Europe were too late to mitigate the introduction of the virus.
He exaggerated when he said “[w]e developed a wide array of effective treatments,” including convalescent plasma, which he claimed “will save thousands and thousands of lives.” There are only a few known treatments for COVID-19, and convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be effective.
The president again falsely claimed that he built the “greatest” and “strongest” economy in “the history of the world.” The U.S. economy has grown faster under other presidents — and so have jobs.
Trump claimed that Biden has pledged “a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families.” Biden said he won’t boost income taxes for anyone making less than $400,000 a year.
The president falsely accused Biden of condemning rioters only after the Democratic convention. Biden repeatedly condemned violent protests before the convention.

82,Social Media Posts Spread Bogus Coronavirus Conspiracy Theory,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/social-media-posts-spread-bogus-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory/,,"27.9K1Quick Take
Multiple social media posts are spreading a bogus conspiracy theory about the deadly Wuhan virus. The posts falsely claim that the virus has been patented and a vaccine is already available. That’s not true; the patents the posts refer to pertain to different viruses.

Full Story 
Following the outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and the announcement of the first American case on Jan. 21, several groups and individuals are circulating false rumors on Facebook about the mystery pathogen.
Numerous posts claim the virus has been patented — and some even suggest, incorrectly, that the virus was made in a lab and a vaccine already exists.
“The new fad disease called the ‘coronavirus’ is sweeping headlines,” one Facebook post, taken from Twitter, reads. “Funny enough, there was a patent for the coronavirus was filed in 2015 and granted in 2018.”
Another, which was shared by others, and is part of a series of false coronavirus posts, proclaims that the virus is “‘new’ yet it was lab created and patented in 2015 (in development since 03’).” 
Yet another proposes a similar conspiracy. “So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today,” the post says. “We have a sudden outbreak. There’s magically already a vaccine available.”
In fact, there is no vaccine yet available for the new coronavirus, which for now goes by the unwieldy moniker of 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. Update, July 7, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the U.S. in December 2020.
And there is no patent related to the new virus, either.
All of the posts link to patents that are related to two different viruses in the coronavirus family. 
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that tend to cause respiratory illnesses in humans and a variety of other illnesses in animals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains on its website. The name comes from the crown, or corona-like appearance of infective viruses when seen under a microscope.
One patent is for a genetic sequence of the virus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that spread to dozens of countries in 2003, sickening more than 8,000 people and killing 774.
“The sequencing was done at the CDC during the SARS outbreak and they were the ones that filed the patent,” Matthew Frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Maryland, explained in an email.
The CDC told the Associated Press in 2003 that the agency was claiming ownership to ensure access, and to prevent others from controlling the technology. In a phone interview, Columbia law professor Harold Edgar told us that following a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 2013, U.S. patent law no longer allows for patents on viral sequences as they exist in nature.
The other supposedly related patent is for a mutated form of avian infectious bronchitis virus, or IBV, which infects poultry, but not people. The patent was filed by the Pirbright Institute, a research institute in the U.K. whose mission is to prevent and control “viral diseases of livestock.” The mutations were created to attenuate, or weaken, the virus, so that it could be used as a vaccine to protect chickens from the disease.
“Neither of these has anything to do with the new 2019-nCoV virus,” said Frieman. “This is clearly a bogus theory that this virus was created in a lab, patented and has a vaccine already made to it.”
Researchers are still working to understand the origin, spread and severity of the latest coronavirus. The outbreak began in early December in Wuhan, a city of around 11 million people in central China.
Evidence suggests the virus likely spilled over to humans from an as-yet-unidentified animal, as has happened in the past for other coronaviruses. The SARS virus, for instance, is thought to have come from bats, and then spread to humans through civets, a cat-like animal eaten as a delicacy in Asia. The SARS virus then proved to be transmissible from person to person.
A similar story played out in 2012 with the virus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which may also have originated in bats, and then spread to humans via camel.
Cases of the new respiratory illness were first reported in people who had connections to a fish market in Wuhan that also sold a variety of live animals. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci told Scientific American on Jan. 22 that the new virus “almost certainly” came from an animal.
It is now clear that the new coronavirus can also pass from person to person, although it is not known how easily it spreads. It’s possible the disease may not be as severe as SARS, but health officials say it is too early to know for sure. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
As of early Jan. 24, at least 26 people have died, all in China, out of nearly 900 confirmed cases worldwide. Deaths have primarily occurred in older people or those who had other health conditions. Cases have also been reported in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. The U.S. patient had recently traveled from Wuhan and is in good condition, according to the CDC.
As for a vaccine, the CDC says it is already working on one with the NIH, but that it is still early in the process. Fauci explained in his Scientific American interview that the agency is partnering with Moderna, a biotech company, to create a messenger RNA-based vaccine. 
“We will likely have a candidate in early phase I trials for safety in about three months,” he said. “That doesn’t mean we will have a vaccine ready for use in three months; even in an emergency, that would take a year or more. But we’re already on it.”
So while efforts have begun to make a vaccine, in part thanks to Chinese researchers who have already shared the sequence of the new virus, it is not true that a vaccine already exists — just as claims that the virus previously had a patent and was manufactured in a lab are also false.

83,Texas Doctor Spreads False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-texas-doctor-spreads-false-claims-about-covid-19-vaccines/,,"
Update, Aug. 23: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.
In a video shared widely on social media, a Texas doctor known for his political activism — and whose vitamin sales prompted a warning by federal officials — is peddling a host of false claims to try to discourage people from getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

Dr. Steven Hotze implores viewers to “just say no” to the vaccines, after a long, error-filled pitch that baselessly alleges that the mRNA vaccines aren’t actually vaccines at all. 
As we’ve explained in previous SciCheck stories, two vaccines currently authorized for use in the U.S., from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are designed using modified messenger RNA. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make spike proteins that then trigger an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. (See “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”) 
Hotze is a conservative activist who unsuccessfully challenged COVID-19 public health measures in Texas last year and who made unproven allegations about voter fraud ahead of the 2020 election. In December, the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission sent Hotze a letter warning him to stop selling his line of vitamins by using misleading suggestions that they could treat or prevent COVID-19.
His video focusing on mRNA vaccines was published on his website Feb. 26. The link to that post has been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. The video has also been viewed tens of thousands of times across various posts on Facebook and Instagram.
We reached out to Hotze about some of his claims in the video and didn’t hear back. We’ll break down a few of his assertions here.
False Claims About Vaccine Efficacy, Definition
Hotze tells his viewers: “If you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected. The so-called COVID-19 vaccine does not provide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19, nor does it prevent the spread of the disease. It does not meet the CDC’s own definition of a vaccine. That’s why it’s a deceptive trade practice under 15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission for pharmaceutical companies who are producing this experimental gene therapy to claim that it’s a vaccine.”
The vaccines have demonstrated in clinical trials to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, as we’ve detailed. The Pfizer and Moderna trials enrolled more than 30,000 people each and found an efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease of at least 94% after the second dose. So his claim that the vaccines don’t “provide any individual who receives the vaccine with immunity to COVID-19″ is wrong.
As we’ve explained before, it’s currently unclear how much the vaccines will limit transmission of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. In other words, while the vaccines were shown to prevent someone from developing symptoms of COVID-19, they may not prevent a person from carrying the virus. But there’s a good chance they will help curb transmission to some degree: Experts say with other vaccines, a vaccinated person, even if infected with the virus, often sheds less virus, therefore making them less contagious.
Hotze’s remark that mRNA vaccines don’t “meet the CDC’s own definition of a vaccine” also holds no weight.
He points out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website defines a vaccine as a “product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.” That’s correct. But that definition is also consistent with the FDA’s decision to issue emergency use authorizations for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines because of their demonstrated efficacy in trials.
“Clearly, Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines are ‘product[s] that stimulate a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease,’ i.e., COVID-19, and they have a protective effect,” Jacob Sherkow, a University of Illinois law professor whose research focuses in part on the legal implications of advanced biotechnologies, told us in an email. Sherkow noted that it’s not entirely clear what the legal effects of the CDC’s website definition are, since “[i]t’s not a formal administrative rule or even a guidance … it’s just a generic definition of a vaccine.”
Hotze’s argument that the mRNA vaccines are a “deceptive trade practice” also doesn’t make sense. While he cites “15 US Code Section 41 of the Federal Trade Commission,” it appears he’s referring to 15 U.S. Code § 45 — since section 41 just deals with the establishment of the FTC.
“The only thing § 45 of the FTC Act does, here, is give FTC authority to police ‘deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,'” Sherkow said. “It doesn’t define what a deceptive act is.”
Sherkow said the definition of a “deceptive practice” rests on many years’ worth of case law: “In general, those arise when three conditions are met: there is a representation or omission that misleads a consumer; the consumer’s interpretation is ‘reasonable’; and the misrepresentation is ‘material,’ i.e., the consumer purchased the product because of the representation.”
“None of those are present here,” he added. “There is no misrepresentation about the nature of these vaccines — indeed, there’s an ocean of information about exactly what they are and how they work.”

Erroneous ‘Gene Therapy’ Assertion
Again referencing the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, Hotze falsely claims: “These so-called vaccines, which are manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s, should more accurately be called experimental gene therapy. They are untested, unproven experimental gene therapy that poses a much greater danger and risk to your health than the COVID-19.”
We’ll first address his false assertion that the vaccines are an “experimental gene therapy” — an allegation he makes repeatedly throughout his video.
The FDA’s website defines gene therapy as a “technique that modifies a person’s genes to treat or cure disease.”
Sherkow, who has written about gene therapy, said the mRNA vaccines don’t qualify as such.
“The mRNA vaccines do not modify a person’s genes, i.e., their genome,” he said. “They’re transcripts of the virus’s Spike gene that get translated into protein and expressed in cells; the mRNA degrades afterwards. The genome remains unchanged.”
Likewise, the co-directors of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development recently explained why the “gene therapy” claims are inaccurate, in a piece addressing vaccine myths for the Washington Post.
“[T]he mRNA delivered through lipid nanoparticles in a vaccine does not enter our genome. It becomes a template for cells to make compounds of amino acids on molecules called ribosomes in the cytoplasm compartment of the cell, outside the nucleus (where the DNA resides),” Dr. Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi wrote. “Our immune system then responds to the new peptide, which resembles the spike protein on the coronavirus. Therefore, it’s not correct to say that the mRNA vaccines are equivalent to ‘gene therapy,’ as some critics of the vaccines have claimed.”
And Hotze’s claim that the mRNA vaccines are “manufactured using cells derived from human babies that were aborted in the 1970s” is wrong, too.
As we’ve explained before, fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early 1960s, one in Sweden and one in England, were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines — such as varicella (chickenpox), rubella and hepatitis A. But those cells aren’t present in the vaccines themselves, since the virus is purified before it goes into a syringe.
The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, however, aren’t made from a virus and are not manufactured using those fetal cell lines, as Hotze claims. That said, one of the cell lines was used to test those two mRNA vaccines to ensure they worked.
A third vaccine approved in the U.S. — a single-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson that does not use the mRNA platform — is made by using an adenovirus that is produced using a retinal cell line that was first obtained from a fetus in 1985, according to the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Like other vaccines manufactured using the cell lines, fetal cells are not actually present in the J&J COVID-19 vaccine.
Distortion Behind Claim of Danger
Hotze distorts the facts in attempting to claim that the mRNA vaccines are dangerous.
He claims that the vaccines will cause your immune system to “be hyper-charged because it’s having to fight off all these viral proteins that your own body is making all the time, and it will overreact when exposed to any type of coronavirus in the future.” He goes on to say that, in previous studies dealing with coronaviruses, “the animals died from an immune system hyper reaction, when they were later exposed to the coronavirus against which they had been previously vaccinated.”
There is no evidence that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines result in such an immune response.
Hotze’s website post of the video references a commentary article from October, before any COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA, in which two researchers warned about the possibility that COVID-19 vaccine candidates could cause antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, or ADE. ADE is a phenomenon that occurs when a previous infection or vaccination generates antibodies that don’t neutralize the virus but instead enhance the virus’ ability to infect cells, which can lead to a worse illness instead of preventing it.
But the animal studies cited in the commentary piece didn’t deal with mRNA vaccines, as Hotze suggests. One 2012 study that’s referenced found that vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV (the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003) caused mice to develop eosinophilia — a high count of a type of white blood cells — when exposed to the live virus. The animals didn’t die, as our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters have explained.
Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who researches vaccines at the Center for Immunization Research, told us in an email that the issue of ADE in relation to SARS-CoV vaccine candidates dealt with inactivated vaccines — not mRNA vaccines. She said the specific immune response issue observed with those vaccine candidates has not been observed with any of the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the U.S.
“We have not seen any cases of enhanced SARS-CoV-2 disease, either in animal models or in vaccinated humans,” she added.
Other experts also have explained that there is no evidence indicating ADE is an issue with the COVID-19 vaccines.
Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist, explored the issue in February on his blog on the website of the journal Science Translational Medicine and explained that animal studies are specifically designed to look for signs of ADE. He said the research into SARS-CoV vaccines provided helpful lessons for developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. (A vaccine for SARS was never approved, as the outbreak ended and there are no known human cases of the disease.)
“So here’s the short version: no sign of ADE during the preclinical animal studies. No sign during the human clinical trials. No sign during the initial vaccine rollouts into the population,” he concluded. “And (so far) no sign of ADE even with the variant strains in different parts of the world. We have things to worry about in this pandemic, but as far as I can tell today, antibody-dependent enhancement does not seem to be one of them.”",Angelo Fichera,2021-03-26 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“It doesn’t define what a deceptive act is.”
Sherkow said the definition of a “deceptive practice” rests on many years’ worth of case law: “In general, those arise when three conditions are met: there is a representation or omission that misleads a consumer; the consumer’s interpretation is ‘reasonable’; and the misrepresentation is ‘material,’ i.e., the consumer purchased the product because of the representation.”

A tweet, shared by President Donald Trump, mischaracterizes a video that purports to show “Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services.” The video actually shows a demonstration in Idaho against a public health order regarding COVID-19 requirements held by a church in a city hall parking lot.
Full Story
A church protest against a local public health order in Moscow, Idaho (population: 25,702), has gotten national attention since President Donald Trump retweeted a video from the event with a claim that falsely suggested it showed “Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services.”
The president added his own comment to his retweet, saying, “DEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY. HOPE YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. VOTE NOW!”
Neither the original claim nor the president’s comment is true.
We’ll start with the video.
Trump retweeted a post from Cliff Maloney, the president of a Texas-based libertarian group, that included a video of a man being handcuffed in a parking lot while a group sings in the background.
Maloney wrote: “If you would have told me in 2019 that we were just 1 year away from Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services, I would have thought you to be insane. This is one of the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen. Pray for America.”
But that misrepresents what the video actually shows.
The event was not an outdoor church service. It was a demonstration against a local order requiring people to wear face masks or stay six feet apart in public to slow the spread of COVID-19.
On Sept. 21, Moscow’s city council had voted unanimously to extend that order until Jan. 5. Latah County, where Moscow is located, is at “minimal risk” for COVID-19, according to the public health district in north central Idaho. But average daily cases in the county rose from about 3 at the beginning of September to about 23 at the beginning of October.
Two days after the council vote, on Sept. 23, Christ Church in Moscow posted on its Facebook page an invitation to gather at city hall for a “flash psalm sing.” The invitation said, “We are asking folks to please not wear a mask.”
Before the demonstration, city workers drew marks on the pavement that were six feet apart so that singers could safely participate.
“The city had tried to provide an avenue for this event to take place,” Moscow Police Chief James Fry told FactCheck.org in a phone interview.
Also, before the event began, officers told the organizer that police would enforce the public health order, he said, and the organizer repeated that warning to participants.
“As soon as he said it, everybody actually moved closer together,” Fry said.
Police issued tickets to five people for violating the city’s ordinance, Fry said, and they charged two of those people for resisting arrest when those people refused to identify themselves.
Among those ticketed was Gabriel Rench, co-host of a political Christian podcast and a Republican candidate for a county office. Rench is the man being arrested in the viral video.
Two days after the incident, Rench was a guest on Glenn Beck’s radio show, where he described the event as a “protest, as kind of a worshipful protest” to the public health order.
Still, the falsehood that the video shows “Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services” continues to spread on social media.
As for Trump’s claim that “DEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY,” that’s not true, either.
The Democratic Party platform for 2020 includes a section on “supporting faith and service,” which says: “Religious freedom is a core American value and a core value of the Democratic Party. Democrats will protect the rights of each American for the free exercise of his or her own religion. It will be the policy of the Democratic Administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world.”

85,Hagler’s Widow Refutes Rumors About How He Died,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-haglers-widow-rebuts-rumors-about-how-he-died/,,"Hall of Fame boxer Marvelous Marvin Hagler “died on March 13 of natural causes,” according to a statement posted on his official website. In a Facebook post, his widow, Kay Hagler, wrote that his death was not the result of a COVID-19 vaccination, as social media posts have claimed without evidence.

There is no evidence that the death of 66-year-old Marvelous Marvin Hagler, a former middleweight boxing champion, was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine, as some have claimed or suggested on social media. It’s the second time this year that we have written about unsubstantiated claims that the vaccines led to a famous Black athlete’s death.

Hagler’s wife, Kay Hagler, announced on Facebook March 13 that he passed unexpectedly that day. Less than 48 hours later, she went back to the popular platform to refute online rumors about how her late husband died.

“For sure wasn’t the vaccine that caused his death,” she wrote in a March 15 post on Hagler’s verified fan club page. “My baby left in peace with his [usual] smile and now is not the time to talk nonsense.”
TMZ Sports reported that James Hagler, one of the boxing legend’s sons, said his father passed away after he had gone to the hospital for chest pains and trouble breathing. A message later posted on Marvelous Marvin Hagler’s official website said he died “of natural causes near his home in New Hampshire.”
No other details were provided in the brief statement.
Many social media claims linking Hagler’s death to a COVID-19 vaccination were based solely on a post from Thomas Hearns, one of his most famous boxing rivals.
The day Hagler died, Hearns — in a since-deleted post — took to Instagram to encourage people to pray for his friend and former opponent, whom he said had suffered complications after a vaccination.
“A real true warrior Pray for the king and his family .. he’s in ICU fighting the after effects of the vaccine!” Hearns wrote — without disclosing the source of that information. 
In her Facebook post, Kay Hagler never actually confirmed whether her husband had been vaccinated against COVID-19.

In a follow-up post that also was deleted, Hearns said that his original post about Hagler was not intended to be an “anti vaccine campaign.”

Yet that’s exactly how some have used his post on social media.
“The vaccine killed Marvin Hagler,” one Twitter user wrote in a post including a screenshot of Hearns’ comments on Instagram, for example.
In another post referencing Hearns’ original comments, a Facebook user wrote, in part: “Marvin Hagler passed away at age of 66 after receiving the Covid vaccine. When will people wake up. Thousands are dying and tens of thousands are being injured by the vaccine.”



But even if Hagler was vaccinated before his death, it’s wrong to assume the vaccine caused his passing. SciCheck has written before about that faulty reasoning.



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has emphasized that the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are safe and effective.



The CDC says common vaccination side effects include fatigue, headache, chills, fever and nausea, as well as pain and swelling at the site of the injection.



But more severe allergic reactions are “rare” and have “occurred in approximately 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated” in the U.S. That’s based on events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the CDC says. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS, regardless of whether a reaction that occurs after immunization is thought to be linked to the vaccine. 



Further, as of March 16, CDC and Food and Drug Administration physicians had investigated all 1,913 VAERS reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine and found “no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.”

86,FactChecking Biden’s Vaccination Goal,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/factchecking-bidens-vaccination-goal/,,"President Joe Biden this week boasted on Twitter about his promise to administer 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, “With the progress we’re making I believe we’ll not only reach that, we’ll break it.” But as some critics have noted, it was a pretty low bar to begin with.
On the day Biden was inaugurated, the U.S. administered nearly 1.5 million shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID Data Tracker. On that day, the seven-day average for the previous week was about 966,000 shots a day. In other words, the U.S. was already virtually at the pace Biden set as his goal before he took any action as president.
By Biden’s second day in office, the seven-day average was at the 1 million doses per day average needed to meet his 100-day goal.

Before I took office, I set a big goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days. With the progress we’re making I believe we’ll not only reach that, we’ll break it.
— President Biden (@POTUS) February 16, 2021

The goal seemed more ambitious when Biden first announced his “100 million shots in the first 100 day” goal in a Dec. 8 speech in Wilmington, Delaware, as president-elect. At that point, vaccinations hadn’t even begun yet.
A New York Times story that day called it an “ambitious” goal and said “fulfilling it will require no hiccups in manufacturing or distributing the vaccine and a willingness by Americans to be vaccinated.” The reporters said the experts they spoke to found Biden’s timeline to be “achievable” but “optimistic.”
It still seemed like an “incredible goal,” as Biden put it, when he talked about the promise on Dec. 29, less than two weeks after the first vaccine doses were administered.
“It would take ramping up five to six times the current pace to 1 million shots a day, but even with that improvement, even if we boost the speed of vaccinations to 1 million shots a day, it will still take months to have a majority of the United States population vaccinated,” Biden said.
The day before he made that speech, Dec. 28, two weeks into distribution, the U.S. had administered a total of 3.5 million doses of vaccine. So measuring from Day One, the daily average was about 250,000 — and it would take four times that rate to get to Biden’s goal of 1 million a day.
But even then, Biden was misleadingly ignoring the upward trend. On Dec. 29, the day of Biden’s speech, the CDC reported that 686,411 vaccines were administered — or roughly two-thirds of what would be needed to meet Biden’s daily goal. The seven-day average that day was 317,766.

To be sure, the vaccine rollout was slower than expected at the beginning. Although then-President Donald Trump had promised to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of 2020, the total at year’s end was just 5.4 million.
But the number of doses administered continued to trend upward during the final weeks of the Trump presidency. On Jan. 7, a little more than a million doses were administered, and the seven-day average was up to 542,000, according to the CDC. By Jan. 14, the seven-day average was up to 918,000 doses per day.
Despite the upward trend, an article in USA Today on Jan. 14 continued to call Biden’s 100-shots-in-100-days promise “a lofty goal to reverse a slow start to the nation’s vaccine rollout.”
That same day, Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden’s COVID-19 task force, called Biden’s goal “aspirational … but doable’’ and warned that the “first days of that 100 days may be substantially slower than it will be towards the end.”
“It’s not going to occur quickly … you’re going to see the ramp-up occurring only when the resources really begin to flow,” Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told STAT news.
But by that time, the average number of daily doses was already nearing the 1 million shots a day threshold needed to meet Biden’s promise. And by Jan. 20, the day of Biden’s inauguration — a day that saw nearly 1.5 million vaccines administered — the seven-day average was about 966,000.
The following day, Jan. 21, another roughly 1.5 million doses were administered, bringing the seven-day average to over 1 million per day. After Biden gave a speech on the COVID-19 response, a reporter asked if — given the pace of vaccination he inherited — Biden shouldn’t have set his bar higher.
“When I announced it, you all said, ‘It’s not possible.’ Come on, give me a break man,” Biden responded.
At a press briefing later that day, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was also asked why Biden wasn’t “shooting just a little bit higher.”
“Well, none of us are mathematicians, myself included, so I asked our team to do a little math on this,” Psaki responded. “So, the Trump administration was given 36 million doses when they were in office for 38 days. They administered a total of about 17 million shots.  That’s about less than 500,000 shots a day. What we’re proposing is to double that to about 1 million shots per day. And we have outlined this goal and objective in coordination and consultation with our health and medical experts. So it is ambitious. It’s something that we feel is bold and was called that certainly at the time, and we’re working overtime to help to achieve it — try to achieve it.”
Psaki’s math is roughly accurate, but again, it misleadingly ignores the trend line, and the fact that the U.S. had virtually reached the 1 million doses per day average in the week before Biden took office.
Indeed, many experts were underwhelmed by Biden’s goal.
“I think we probably need to be a bit more audacious in these goals,” CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said on air shortly after Biden bristled at the reporter who asked if the goal shouldn’t be higher.
Gupta praised the Biden administration’s vaccination plans, particularly for expanding the role of the federal government in helping states to administer the vaccinations.
But given the number of vaccinations occurring by the time Biden took office, Gupta said the administration may be “under promising and with the hope of over delivering.”
In remarks on Jan. 25, Biden seemed to acknowledge the low bar, suggesting the U.S. might beat his goal by 50%.
“I think, with the grace of God, and the goodwill of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to … 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,” Biden said.
But by the following day, he had retreated back to his original “ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.” He added that was “not the endpoint; it’s just the start.”
By Feb. 9, the seven-day average had already moved beyond 1.5 million doses per day. According to an NBC News tracker of Biden’s vaccination goal, the U.S. is on pace to reach 150 million doses in Biden’s first 100 days, which ends April 29.
In a press briefing on Feb. 17, a reporter asked Psaki about Vice President Kamala Harris’ comment in an interview that aired Feb. 14, “In many ways, we [the Biden administration] are starting from scratch on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year.” Was that appropriate, the reporter asked, given that the U.S. was administering nearly a million shots a day in the week before Biden took office?
“When the president came in and the vice president came in, there were not enough vaccines, there were not enough vaccinators, there were not enough vaccination locations,” Psaki said. “They’ve taken significant steps to address all of those issues. Yes, in the week prior to the president taking office, there were about 800- to 900,000, as you said, doses doing — being given a day. The average was about 400- to 500,000 prior to that. Last week, the average was 1.7 million a day. So there are significant steps that have been taken.”
The Biden administration is free to boast about its efforts to ramp up vaccinations, which experts have also praised. But Biden and Psaki are spinning the facts. Although the initial rollout was slow under Trump and many first viewed Biden’s goal as ambitious, vaccinations steadily increased each week, nearly reaching 1 million doses a day when Biden took office.
At the current rate, there’s no reason to think the U.S. won’t “break” Biden’s goal of 100 million shots in 100 days, as he boasted on Twitter.

That contradicts Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s claim that, “in most states,” Black residents are “the biggest group” of unvaccinated people.
The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, health-issues organization, reported that across 40 states with comparable data as of Aug. 16, the percentage of people who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was 50% for whites, 45% for Hispanics and 40% for Blacks. Because Blacks (41.1 million) and Hispanics (62.1 million) make up a much smaller portion of the overall U.S. population than whites (204.3 million), those percentages indicate that, in raw numbers, far more white people remain unvaccinated against the disease.
But Patrick, in an Aug. 19 appearance on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle,” falsely implied that it was unvaccinated Black people who are responsible for the resurgence of the coronavirus in his state and around the rest of the country.
The show’s host, Laura Ingraham, asked him to respond to critics who fault the policies of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration for the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Texas. In response, Patrick said “Democrats like to blame Republicans on that,” a reference to those who have cited polling data showing that as many as nearly half of Republican adults say they have not been vaccinated. 
He then added: “Well, the biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated. The last time I checked, over 90% of them vote for Democrats in their major cities and major counties.”
However, there is no support for the claim that Black people are the “biggest group” of people who have yet to get a shot.
Besides the KFF analysis of state data, a KFF poll of individuals conducted between July 15 and July 27 found that among unvaccinated adults, 57% were white, 20% were Hispanic and 13% were Black.
“While White adults account for the largest share (57%) of unvaccinated adults, Black and Hispanic people remain less likely than their White counterparts to have received a vaccine, leaving them at increased risk, particularly as the variant spreads,” KFF said in an Aug. 18 issue brief.
U.S. Census Bureau estimates (Table 5a) — based on the most recent Household Pulse Survey for the period between July 21 and Aug. 2 — also indicate that the number of unvaccinated white adults (about 26.6 million) exceeded the number of unvaccinated Hispanic adults (about 8.5 million) and Black adults (about 6.7 million) at the time.

In defense of his claim, Patrick posted a statement to his Facebook and Twitter accounts that revealed that he conflated vaccination rates with the number of unvaccinated people.
“Last night on Laura Ingraham I was asked about Democrat attacks on Texas’ COVID-19 response,” the statement reads. “I shared with her information recently reported in both the Houston Chronicle and Texas Tribune, as well as on the Texas Department of State Health Services website. Not surprisingly, Democrat social media trolls were up late misstating the facts and fanning the flames of their lies.”
“Federal and State data clearly indicate that Black vaccination rates are significantly lower than White or Hispanic rates,” the statement continued. “Democrats continue to play politics with peoples’ lives, pandering to rather than serving certain constituencies. Republican leadership will continue to encourage vaccination without mandates in all populations.”
While Patrick said he had been referring to reporting from the Houston Chronicle and the Texas Tribune in his response to Ingraham’s question, both publications recently said that his claims on the show, as it relates to Texas, are false.
The newspapers noted that the COVID-19 vaccination rate among Black Texans  — who make up about 13% of the state’s population — is indeed lower than that of other races in the state. However, based on the total number of people, most of the remaining unvaccinated residents who are eligible to be immunized in Texas are white or Hispanic, the newspapers wrote in separate articles about what Patrick said in the Fox News interview.
“There are an estimated 5.6 million white people who are eligible and unvaccinated, while the same figure is 1.9 million for Black people, who make up a far smaller part of the overall population,” the Texas Tribune said in its Aug. 20 article. “The figure is 4.9 million for Hispanic people, whose population is now nearly as large as the non-Hispanic white population in Texas.”
As for Patrick’s suggestion that Black people are driving cases up in Texas, it was Hispanic and white residents who accounted for 37% and 32% of the state’s 99,989 confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the week of Aug. 20, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Black residents made up nearly 15% of the cases and in 14% of the cases the race of the person was unknown.

88,Vaccine Recipient Targeted With Baseless ‘Crisis Actor’ Claim,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/vaccine-recipient-targeted-with-baseless-crisis-actor-claim/,,"Quick Take
Social media posts are peddling the baseless claim that the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom was actually a “crisis actor.” There is no evidence for that conspiracy theory.

Full Story
On Dec. 8, a 90-year-old woman in England became the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, following its approval for use in the United Kingdom.
But falsehoods attempting to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the moment, and on her identity, quickly followed.
On Facebook and Twitter, posts baselessly claimed that Margaret Keenan was actually a “crisis actor.”
Such nonsense claims of “actors” being used in high-profile events aren’t new: We’ve debunked similar claims that followed the death of George Floyd and the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, for example.
A Dec. 9 Facebook post showed a photo of Keenan receiving the shot alongside a screenshot of a female actor’s listing on a talent website, and then another photo of a woman falling.
There is absolutely no evidence the women seen in the different photos are the same person, and the posts don’t offer any. Instead, they simply string photos of women together and present it as supposed proof for the wild conspiracy theory. There are noticeable differences between the women in the photos.
A reverse image search shows the last picture is of a woman falling during a September protest — which was against pandemic-related restrictions — in London. The photo is on Getty Images, and the caption does not identify the woman. Readers can compare that image to a photo of Keenan without a mask and to the actor’s photos.
Keenan received the shot at the University Hospital, Coventry in England and was discharged on Dec. 9. Multiple news outlets identified her as a grandmother nearing 91 and a former jewelry shop assistant. The National Health Service in England said Keenan was originally from Ireland and has lived in Coventry for more than 60 years.
Some posts, including a tweet from a well-followed conservative activist, also falsely suggested that the footage of Keenan receiving the shot had been used by CNN in October.
“Excuse me, but how is the exact same person who’s the ‘first to get vaccinated’ today…also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October?” the tweet said. “Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true?”
But CNN merely featured the video of Keenan receiving the shot, along with several other recent videos, at the top of an older story related to COVID-19. It’s not uncommon for news websites to feature newer videos on older pages.
Those who visit the Oct. 22 story — titled “Faulty US Covid-19 response meant 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths, report finds” — can see the video including Keenan is in a carousel of several videos that were produced after the story in question. Archived versions of the same story — from Oct. 30, Nov. 1 and Nov. 3, for example — demonstrate that the videos featured at the top repeatedly change.
The claim doesn’t make sense for other reasons. The screenshot included in the tweet shows that the video of Keenan includes the headline “UK Patients Now First in World to Get Authorized COVID Vaccine.” So the video was clearly using the footage to depict the first vaccinations.
Also, the video of Keenan lists the number of U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 as being more than 285,000; that number was reached this week. The death toll now stands at more than 290,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University as of Dec. 10.

89,"Vaccines Benefit Those Who Have Had COVID-19, Contrary to Viral Posts",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-vaccines-benefit-those-who-have-had-covid-19-contrary-to-viral-posts/,,"The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.
The authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be safe and effective in clinical trials and in real-world conditions. Out of more than 220 million doses administered so far and clinical trials with thousands of participants, there is no evidence showing that vaccinating those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections could be unsafe. 
On the contrary, increasingly growing evidence shows one dose of the vaccine benefits individuals who’ve recovered from the infection, boosting their immune response and providing them with full protection for a period of time. 
“Our study and several other studies show that there is a benefit, immunologically … in people who were previously infected,” E. John Wherry, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview.
Yet a number of viral posts question the need of vaccinating those who’ve already recovered from COVID-19, and one of them, published by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, falsely claims it “could potentially cause harm, or even death.” 
Researchers told FactCheck.org that is not what the evidence is showing. 
“There’s no indication that vaccinating people who had previously had COVID is resulting in an increased risk of adverse events,” Wherry said. 
Wherry, who is one of the lead authors of a study looking at the immune responses to the mRNA vaccines in individuals with and without previous infections, said people who recover from the disease show different levels of antibodies created by the immune system to identify and neutralize the virus. The vaccines, he said, improved the immune response in individuals by raising the levels of neutralizing antibodies in those who’ve been infected. 
“Some people actually have fairly low antibody responses that are not sufficient to neutralize the virus, especially variant viruses. When you vaccinate them uniformly, you get high antibody titers [measurements] and high neutralization titers, so there’s an improvement in at least one of the key metrics of immunity following vaccination,” he said.
According to guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who’ve already had COVID-19 should be vaccinated anyway because “experts do not yet know how long” they are protected from getting sick again. Those who’ve gotten the disease get some protection by building what’s called natural immunity. And although available evidence shows that reinfection is uncommon in the months following the first infection, the CDC says that may vary over time. 
“Available data suggest that previously infected individuals can be at risk of COVID-19 (i.e., reinfection) and could benefit from vaccination. Furthermore, data suggest that the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines in previously infected individuals is just as favorable as in previously uninfected individuals,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told us in an email. 
Up until now, the passive and active surveillance systems set up to monitor the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines have only found rare adverse events associated with the vaccines. 
A small number of people (2 to 5 people per million vaccinated) have reported a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. And the CDC and the FDA are studying a small number of cases of people who experienced a rare and severe type of blood clot with low platelets after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. As a result, the agencies recommended a pause in the use of this product. On April 23, a CDC panel of advisers recommended the pause be lifted. 
No Evidence of Risk for Previously Infected Individuals 
In a blog post on The Defender, a website owned by R.F.K. Jr.’s organization, Children’s Health Defense, a freelance reporter writes that there’s no science supporting the need of vaccinating people who have recovered from COVID-19. “There’s a potential risk of harm, including death, in vaccinating those who’ve already had the disease or were recently infected,” the post claimed. 
Researchers don’t agree, including one quoted by The Defender. 
Dr. Colleen Kelley, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Emory University School of Medicine and the principal investigator for Moderna’s and Novavax’s phase 3 vaccine trials at Emory, is quoted by The Defender as saying people with previous infection get “harsher side effects” after vaccination. Her remarks came from a HuffPost article in March.
In a phone interview, Kelley told us that tolerable side effects are expected, and not always present. In the Moderna trials, “there did not appear to be an increased rate of side effects among people who were antibody positive when they were vaccinated,” she said.  
“There is absolutely no evidence that there is any harm for people to be vaccinated, who have previously had COVID disease,” Kelley said. 
The Defender’s claims are mostly based on statements by Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, a former assistant professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, who has been warning health officials, vaccine manufacturers and more recently university leaders of the potential danger of vaccinating people who have recently been infected with the novel coronavirus. 
Noorchashm has been voicing his arguments widely, including on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Today“ and The Defender podcast. But he admits they are based on “a ‘prognostication’ in that I have put it forth in the absence of clear ‘evidence’ of it being a material risk.” 
Based on previous studies not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Noorchashm argues that antigens of SARS-CoV-2 remain in the tissues of someone who’s been infected for some time after they’ve recovered. The vaccine, he says, reactivates the immune response, targeting the tissues where these antigens remain, causing further inflammation and damage, including to the vascular endothelium, the thin tissue that lines the heart and blood vessels. 
“Most pertinently, when viral antigens are present in the vascular endothelium or other layers of the blood vessel, and especially in elderly and frail with cardiovascular disease, the antigen specific immune response incited by the vaccine is almost certain to do damage to the vascular endothelium,” he said in a Jan. 26 letter sent to FDA officials and Pfizer executives. “Such vaccine directed endothelial damage is certain to cause blood clot formation with the potential for major thromboembolic complications, at least in a subset of such patients.” 
In a phone interview with FactCheck.org, Noorchashm explained that all medical treatments, including vaccines, have some complications. And if those complications happen when a treatment is avoidable — in this case, he says, vaccinating those who’ve recently been infected — then that’s potentially harmful. 
His recommendation is to test people’s antibodies before vaccination and to delay vaccination for approximately eight months after infection. He and his wife, a physician who died in 2017, fought for years to ban a tool used to remove uterine fibroids, after the procedure spread cancer into his wife’s abdomen. 
Dr. Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa whose lab studies immunopathology in respiratory virus infections, told us he’s not aware of any scientific data that demonstrates that viral antigens persist long after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has gone away. And if there were, he says, there would likely be insufficient levels to drive such a robust immune response to cause the damage Noorchashm suggests. 
“Generally, once the virus is cleared, there can be some viral antigen that persists in various locations, so it is possible there could be some in the endothelium,” Varga said. “Again, I’m not aware of any studies that have shown that to be the case. But even if there were small amounts of viral antigen, generally that shouldn’t be enough viral antigen to induce the type of damage that would need to occur to have the kind of more severe outcome.” 
Dr. Donna Farber, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University focused on immunological memory, told us Noorchashm’s prognostication is not consistent with the data. 
“The data are that the virus is cleared from the lungs, the virus is cleared from the upper respiratory tract. And so if there’s no virus, there’s no antigen,” Farber, who recently published a study on the immune response to COVID-19 in the lungs, said in a phone interview. 
Farber added that the protective immunity provided by the vaccine, neutralizing antibodies, do not cause the sort of harm Noorchashm is talking about. That could happen, she says as an example, if there was a virus hidden in cells and then a patient is given cytotoxic T cells, a type of immune cell that can kill infected cells or cancer cells. 
“But the chance of that happening in a vaccine — and for a vaccine that’s really targeting neutralizing antibodies and not, you know, the sort of a killer T cell response —  it’s just inconsistent with the science,” she said. 
Farber also said for most pathogens, our immune system requires repeated exposure to get protection over time. That’s why people get a vaccine for influenza every year, she said, regardless if they’ve been exposed to the virus or not. 
“Seeing an antigen again and again, isn’t bad for you. It’s what we do all the time. And it’s what our immune system has evolved to do. And that’s how it generates its best memory,” she said.
Benefits of Vaccine on Previously Infected Individuals
According to The Defender’s post, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued a report “that falsely claimed a Pfizer study proved the vaccine was highly effective” for people with previous infections. 
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, “found that vaccine studies showed no benefit to people who had coronavirus and that getting vaccinated didn’t change their odds of getting reinfected” and asked the CDC to fix the mistake in the report, The Defender said.
The CDC added an erratum to the report on Jan. 29, but it merely mentions that consistent high efficacy was found “in a secondary analysis including participants both with or without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
The report shows that in the Pfizer/BioNTech clinical trials the vaccine was 94% effective and “when you look at both groups together, the data suggest the vaccine works well in both groups,” CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlung told us. It also showed, Nordlung added, that those who had COVID-19 can still be at risk of reinfection and could benefit from the vaccine, not be harmed by it. 
As we’ve explained, scientific studies do show benefits for those who’ve recovered from the infections. 
A recent study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal found that a prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not completely protect young people against reinfection. The study observed over 3,000 healthy U.S. Marine Corps recruits, 18 to 20 years old, from May to November 2020. The study found that around 10% of the participants who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 became reinfected. In comparison, 48% of those without previous infection became infected.
A different observational study was done in Denmark using data from approximately 10 million polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests during two surges last year, from March to May 2020 and from September to December. According to their analysis a previous infection provided about 80-83% protection against a second infection in people younger than 65 years old and 47% for those aged 65 years and older. 
According to a CDC study, both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines reduced the risk of infection, in real-world conditions, by 90% two weeks after the second dose. 
In addition, it has been reported that the vaccine may actually be helping people with previous infections and long-lasting symptoms, what’s been called “long COVID.” 
When asked about other studies supporting Rep. Massie’s statements, his office sent us an FDA presentation and an FDA memo reviewing the efficacy and safety of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Both show high general efficacy and the second specifically mentions that since the clinical trial didn’t include many people with prior infection “available data are insufficient to make conclusions about benefit in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.” 
John Kennedy, Massie’s communications director, told us the congressman didn’t say whether the vaccine can be dangerous for those with previous infections. In fact, Kennedy said, “Congressman Massie believes that the Pfizer and Moderna trials he commented on didn’t really demonstrate higher rates of adverse reaction for those with prior infection.”  
Update, Aug. 10: A CDC retrospective study in Kentucky found unvaccinated residents who were infected with the coronavirus in 2020 had a 2.34 times higher risk of being reinfected in May and June 2021, compared with those who were fully vaccinated. In the Aug. 6 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the CDC concluded: “To reduce their likelihood for future infection, all eligible persons should be offered COVID-19 vaccine, even those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.” 
The case-control study looked at adult Kentucky residents who had confirmed positive COVID-19 test results from March through December 2020, according to a state database. It then identified case-patients who had a subsequent positive COVID-19 test from May 1 through June 30, 2021. A control group included residents who had been infected in 2020 and weren’t reinfected in the May through June time frame. The study matched 246 case-patients to 492 control individuals on a 1:2 ratio based on age, sex and date of the first positive test. Vaccination data from the Kentucky Immunization Registry showed 20.3% of case-patients and 34.3% of controls were fully vaccinated.  
“The findings from this study suggest that among previously infected persons, full vaccination is associated with reduced likelihood of reinfection, and, conversely, being unvaccinated is associated with higher likelihood of being reinfected,” the CDC said.
The agency cautioned that the study was based on one state and a short reinfection time period, meaning the “findings cannot be used to infer causation,” and that larger studies are needed.   
Vaccination After Infection: How Long to Wait?
Although the CDC once recommended that those recovering from COVID-19 wait 90 days before receiving a vaccine, that advice now only applies to those who were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. 
“While there is no recommended minimum interval between infection and vaccination, current evidence suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is low in the months after initial infection but may increase with time due to waning immunity,” CDC’s interim clinical considerations for use of the vaccines say. “Thus, while vaccine supply remains limited, people with recent documented acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may choose to temporarily delay vaccination, if desired, recognizing that the risk of reinfection and, therefore, the need for vaccination, might increase with time following initial infection.”
Experts interviewed for this story agreed that those recovering from COVID-19 or an infection should wait somewhere between three weeks and 90 days to get vaccinated. But that’s because that would ensure a better immune response, not because it could be dangerous.
“Usually you want to wait a month for the immune response to die down a little bit and for you to get back to baseline, because if you’re back to baseline, you’ll respond better to vaccines,” Farber said. 
Varga added it is best to give the immune system some time to build memory cells, which would improve its response the next time the body sees the antigen. 
“You would get a lower antibody response and T cell response if you got vaccinated, you know, just a very short time frame after recovering, versus if it was, you know, three or four weeks ago,” he said.
Vaccination After Infection: One or Two Doses?
The FDA issued its emergency use authorization to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines based on the safety and efficacy evidence provided by clinical trials using two doses of the vaccine. 
“Individuals who have received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose on schedule to complete the vaccination series,” said an FDA spokesperson.
But a number of recent studies, including some which have not yet been peer-reviewed, show that only one dose could be enough for those previously infected to be fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 and some of its variants. 
One of them, published by a team from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Science Immunology, found that in individuals who recovered from the infection, the first vaccine dose “significantly boosted” antibody and memory B cell responses, but a second dose did not increase “circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers or antigen-specific memory B cells.” 
The study was relatively small —  44 healthy individuals, including 11 who had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection —  but it was the first study to look at memory B cells, which provide long-term immunity, in addition to antibodies, which provide immediate response. 
Another study published as a preprint on medRxiv by a research team led by Florian Krammer and Viviana Simon from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, recruited 109 participants, including 41 with previous infections. The study showed that the immune response to the first dose of the vaccine for those previously infected was equal, and sometimes stronger, than the response to the second for those who had never had SARS-CoV-2.
None of these eight studies described harmful effects of vaccination, either with one or two doses, on participants who had suffered a previous infection. The Mount Sinai study found that those already primed with the infection showed a stronger immune response (sore arm, fever, chills, fatigue) to the first dose of the vaccine. But Wherry, one of the lead authors of the Penn study, said their study observed no increase in circulating antibodies after the second dose. 
“We did not see any harm from the second dose, we just didn’t see any benefit,” Wherry said. 
Is one vaccine dose enough then? 
Maybe, according to the National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, if other studies support these results and FDA and CDC expert advisors agree. In a blog, Collins wrote that such a policy is under consideration in France and, if implemented, it could extend global vaccine supply and speed up the vaccination process.  
“While much more research is needed—and I am definitely not suggesting a change in the current recommendations right now—the results raise the possibility that one dose might be enough for someone who’s been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and already generated antibodies against the virus,” he wrote. 
An FDA spokesperson said studies “are currently being conducted to evaluate whether one dose is sufficient” for those with previous infections. 
Wherry said larger studies are needed, specifically some looking at protection. So far, all of the studies are looking at immunological events, but none of them have studied how well one dose could protect someone in the real world. 
“I’m reluctant to change policy based on immunological data alone. I’d want to see actual efficacy of one dose versus two doses. And that’s gonna be very hard to do in the real world,” Wherry said. 
Clarification, April 27: Although nothing in the article indicates that Dr. Noorchashm is a member of an anti-vaccination group, Dr. Noorchashm requested that we add that he is not anti-vaccine. He said he has been vaccinated against COVID-19.

91,COVID-19: The Unvaccinated Pose a Risk to the Vaccinated,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/covid-19-the-unvaccinated-pose-a-risk-to-the-vaccinated/,,"Q: How do people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 pose a risk to people who have been vaccinated?
A: An unvaccinated person who is infected with COVID-19 poses a much greater risk to others who are also unvaccinated. But vaccines are not 100% effective, so there is a chance that an unvaccinated person could infect a vaccinated person — particularly the vulnerable, such as elderly and immunocompromised individuals.
FULL QUESTION
How can the unvaccinated possibly pose a threat to the vaccinated? How does that work? What is the risk exactly?
FULL ANSWER
The question above was not asked by a SciCheck reader; it was posed by Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show on Sept. 13.
At the time, Carlson was discussing the Sept. 9 speech in which President Joe Biden announced that he had directed the Labor Department to develop a temporary emergency rule for businesses with 100 or more employees that would require workers to be fully vaccinated or be tested for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus at least once a week.
“The bottom line: We’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers,” Biden said. “We’re going to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America.”
Carlson argued that Biden’s proposal was about controlling Americans — not about public health — and questioned why the vaccinated needed to be protected.
“Virtually every sentence of the speech reinforced a single point again and again. And it was this: Your fellow Americans are dangerous to you,” Carlson said in the segment, clips of which have received around 1 million views on Facebook and Instagram. “They could kill you. And that includes your family, it includes your friends, it includes the people you sit next to at work. All of these people are threats to you and only the Biden administration can save you.”
“Think about that for a moment,” Carlson continued. “Does it make sense? If the vaccine works — and they assure us adamantly that it does work and they punish us if we question how well it works — then how can the unvaccinated possibly pose a threat to the vaccinated? How? What exactly is the risk exactly to the vaccinated from the unvaccinated? Joe Biden didn’t tell us the answer. He didn’t tell us because he doesn’t know. No one knows. There is no answer.”
It’s not the first time that Carlson has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines. But experts told FactCheck.org that unvaccinated people with COVID-19 are a potential threat to people who have been fully immunized against the disease.
“When people ask me, ‘What’s the worst thing that anti-vaccine people say,’ it’s when they say, ‘What do you care what I do? You’re vaccinated,'” Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview.
Offit said that thinking is based, in part, on the incorrect assumption that the vaccines are 100% effective at preventing an infection or illness, which is not true of any vaccine.
The Risk
Although all of the vaccines approved and authorized for use in the United States are effective at preventing symptomatic disease, so-called “breakthrough” cases of COVID-19 after vaccination are to be expected — perhaps even more so now because of the more contagious delta variant of the virus.
In a Sept. 17 update on COVID-19 epidemiology and vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included an analysis of several studies conducted in the U.S. and other countries on vaccine effectiveness against the delta variant. The update said that since the introduction of delta, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization ranged from 75% to 95% and effectiveness against infection ranged from 39% to 84% — depending on the region. That compared with a pre-delta range of 84% to 97% effectiveness against hospitalization and a range of 72% to 97% effectiveness against infection.

“Even if you’ve gotten a vaccine there is still a chance,” albeit a “much lower” one, “that you can get symptomatic infection” after contracting the virus from an unvaccinated person, Offit explained. “There is still a chance that you can get serious infection and there is still a chance you can be hospitalized or die from that infection.”
In particular, immunocompromised people, who already have moderately to severely weakened immune systems, “are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, and may not build the same level of immunity” from the vaccines compared with people who are not immunocompromised, the CDC says. That’s why the Food and Drug Administration authorized a third dose of the mRNA vaccines for certain immunocompromised people.
Dr. Mounzer Agha, a hematologist and director of the Mario Lemieux Center for Blood Cancers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who has studied blood cancers and the vaccines, told the Washington Post in May that in order for cancer patients who don’t develop immunity from the vaccines to be protected, they need people around them to be vaccinated. “Everyone knows someone who has cancer. And if you care about that person, you should get the vaccine and tell your friends to get it,” Agha told the Post.
Also, studies show vaccine effectiveness against infection and milder forms of illness wanes over time, and the elderly can experience immunosenescence, a decreased immune response due to aging. On Sept. 17, the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee unanimously recommended an emergency use authorization for a booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for those age 65 and older and those at “high risk of severe COVID-19,” to be given at least six months after completion of the primary two-dose series.
Update, Sept. 25: The FDA amended the Pfizer EUA to allow for the booster shots, and the CDC issued recommendations for certain populations. Those recommendations say that people age 65 and older, residents in long-term care facilities, and people age 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions should get a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at least six months after they completed the primary two-shot series. The agency said that two other groups – those age 18 to 49 with underlying medical conditions or 18 to 64 with increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 because of their jobs or institutional setting – “may” get a booster shot in the same time frame “based on their individual benefits and risks.”  
The CDC tracks reports of hospitalizations and deaths that occur after “breakthrough infection,” which is the term it uses when a person contracts the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 at least two weeks after receiving all recommended doses of one of the approved or authorized vaccines. The agency used to report all known instances of breakthrough cases, including the asymptomatic and mild infections, but changed its reporting system in May to focus on “severe cases of vaccine breakthrough.”
As of Sept. 13, the CDC had received reports of 15,790 patients with a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection who were hospitalized or died. That was out of more than 178 million people in the United States who had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
About one-fifth of the deaths (516 of 3,040) and hospitalizations (2,562 of 12,750) were “asymptomatic or not COVID-related,” the CDC said.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia actually answered Carlson’s question years ago, in a pre-COVID-19 featured article titled “If Vaccines Work, Why Do Unvaccinated People Pose a Risk?”
In addition to the point about all vaccines being less than 100% effective, the September 2017 CHOP post noted that more unvaccinated people in a population leads to more virus transmission.
“The greater the number of unvaccinated people in a community, the more opportunity germs have to spread. This means outbreaks are more difficult to stem and everyone is at greater risk of exposure — including vaccinated people,” it said.
Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist David Dowdy made a similar point.
“Unfortunately, while the vaccines are highly effective — and particularly effective against serious disease — they are not perfect,” he told us in an email. “Whenever transmission rates go up, therefore, the risk goes up for everyone.”
Based on the number of COVID-19 cases, Dowdy calculated that when compared with mid-June, the risk of developing COVID-19 in the U.S. — regardless of vaccination status — had increased 15-fold as of mid-September, when the CDC said there was high community transmission in every state.
“In other words, there is a higher risk of a vaccinated person getting COVID-19 in September than of an unvaccinated person getting COVID-19 back in June — just because everyone’s risk has gone up,” Dowdy said.
Still, the risk is higher for the unvaccinated. A CDC study published Sept. 10 — but based on data from April to mid-July — found that, due to the delta variant, the unvaccinated (including those who were only partially vaccinated) were nearly five times more likely to become infected, about 10 times more likely to require hospitalization and almost 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated individuals.
And in several states, there are so many COVID-19-related hospitalizations — the vast majority of which are unvaccinated patients — that beds in intensive care units are near capacity, making it difficult not only to treat COVID-19 patients but those with medical emergencies not related to the disease.
It’s also possible that an unvaccinated individual could transmit the virus to a vaccinated parent who could pass it on to a child or children under the age of 12, who currently are not eligible to be vaccinated. On Sept. 20, Pfizer and BioNTech announced clinical trial results showing that its vaccine was safe and effective for children ages 5 to 11 — but the vaccine still needs to be authorized or approved for that age group by the FDA.
In a Sept. 15 Washington Post opinion piece, Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting public health professor at George Washington University, and Sam Wang, a professor of neuroscience at Princeton University, compared being unvaccinated in public to drunken driving.
“Some who argue that vaccination is solely a matter of individual choice would say that you can choose to protect yourself. If you’re vaccinated, why do you care if others around you aren’t?” the professors wrote. “But again, consider the analogy: Three out of every eight people killed are not the intoxicated driver, but their passengers or people in other vehicles. Similarly, with covid-19, the risk is borne not only by the person making the decision but also by others who cross their path.”
“The vaccine is simultaneously like a great seat belt and a choice to drive sober,” they added. “The seat belt reduces your chance of severe injury in an accident. Driving sober reduces the risk of the accident in the first place. The vaccine does both, but it still matters if you’re surrounded by reckless drivers. No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and the more virus is around us — in this case, carried by the unvaccinated, who are five times more likely to be infected and thus to spread coronavirus — the more likely the vaccinated are to become infected.”

92,No Evidence Vaccines Impact Fertility,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-no-evidence-vaccines-impact-fertility/,,"Q: Do the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility?
A: There’s no evidence that approved vaccines cause fertility loss. Although clinical trials did not study the issue, loss of fertility has not been reported among thousands of trial participants nor confirmed as an adverse event among millions who have been vaccinated.  

FULL QUESTION
A group of woman in their 20’s I know are not getting the vaccine. They are nurses and teachers. They say that the vaccine can cause infertility. Is this true?
FULL ANSWER
On Feb. 5, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine released a statement assuring patients that there’s no evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines can impact the capacity to conceive children. 
Although there’s limited research on the matter since clinical trials did not specifically study fertility, no related issues have been reported among thousands of trial participants. In fact, some of them got pregnant. Initial studies on animals for the Moderna vaccine showed no impact on female reproduction or fetal development either. And although detecting fertility issues can take time, as of Jan. 20, fertility loss has not been found to be a side effect among millions who have already received the vaccines after authorization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Loss of fertility is scientifically unlikely,” health reproductive experts concluded in their statement.  
The statement was issued to address public anxiety caused by baseless viral claims stating that vaccines can lead to infertility, and even female sterilization. And it reiterates previous recommendations for pregnant patients, as well as those undergoing fertility treatment or planning to conceive. 
“Since the vaccine is not a live virus, there is no reason to delay pregnancy attempts because of vaccination administration or to defer treatment until the second dose has been administered,” according to a document prepared by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in December.
As we have explained, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines, or mRNA, which do not contain a weaker or inactivated version of the virus. The mRNA provides instructions for cells to make their own spike proteins (found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2), prompting the body to generate protective antibodies and activate T cells.
According to the CDC, there is “no risk” of getting COVID-19 from this type of vaccine, and because the mRNA doesn’t enter the nucleus of the cell, it does not affect or interact with a person’s DNA. After making the spike protein, the cells break down the mRNA fairly quickly.
“Given the mechanism of action and the safety profile of the vaccine in non-pregnant individuals, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are not thought to cause an increased risk of infertility,” recommendations posted on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists website say. 
Dr. Eve C. Feinberg, medical director of Northwestern Fertility & Reproductive Medicine and former president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility, says there are really two questions when trying to find out the impact of vaccines in fertility: What do we know about the vaccine and fertility, and what do we know about COVID-19 and pregnancy?  
“And I think that we know a lot more about the negative impact of COVID in pregnancy, on both the mother and potentially the fetus, than about the vaccine on fertility. The mechanism of action of the vaccine is such that there really is no biological possibility as to how the vaccine may negatively impact fertility,” Feinberg, who is also a member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s Coronavirus/COVID-19 Task Force, told us. 
Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said people shouldn’t be worried about COVID-19 vaccines causing infertility. He said it is very hard for a vaccine to do something that natural infection doesn’t do, and fertility loss has not been reported even after roughly 67 million people in the U.S. have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, according to antibody surveillance studies. 
“If you know that 20% of the population has been infected with this virus, is there any evidence that we’ve had a decrease in fertility associated with this massive worldwide pandemic? And the answer is, no,” he said in a video. 
Vaccines Do Not Cause Female Sterilization 


Multiple false claims tying mRNA vaccines with infertility have been circulating, in both English and Spanish, for months. But among them, a false rumor saying they could cause “female sterilization” by training the body to attack a protein vital for the formation of the placenta has been particularly pervasive. 
The false rumor started with an article titled “Head of Pfizer Research: Covid Vaccine is Female Sterilization” that baselessly stated the “vaccine contains a spike protein… called syncytin-1, vital for the formation of the human placenta” and therefore, the vaccine could form an immune response against that protein, causing infertility. 
Syncytin-1 is an envelope protein, derived from a human endogenous retrovirus, critical in the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast, the outermost layer of the human placenta, responsible for nutrient exchange from mother to embryo. 
But according to researchers, neither the Pfizer/BioNTech nor the Moderna vaccines contain syncytin-1.
The story, published on Dec. 2, on a blog called Health and Money News, linked to a petition demanding the European Medicines Agency stop clinical trials on the vaccines for safety concerns. The petition was co-filed by Wolfgang Wodarg, a German physician, and Michael Yeadon, a retired British doctor who worked as a respiratory research employee for Pfizer until 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile. Yeadon had previously claimed the pandemic was “effectively over” in the U.K. and no vaccines were needed. 
According to Wodarg and Yeadon’s petition, syncytin-1 is “also found in homologous form in the spike proteins of SARS viruses,” including SARS-CoV-2. They acknowledge that “[t]here is no indication whether antibodies against spike proteins of SARS viruses would also act like anti-Syncytin-1 antibodies.” But they maintain if it happens, it would cause women to “essentially becoming infertile” by preventing the formation of placenta. 
The false claims were debunked by multiple fact-checkers in December.
In January, a group of independent reproductive health experts published an article in ASRM’s Fertility and Sterility, stating that the vaccine “contains neither syncytin-1 nor the mRNA sequence for syncytin-1.” 
To prove that the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein, or spike protein, is not “homologous,” or similar in structure, to syncytin-1 protein, as Wodarg and Yeadon claimed, the scientists aligned the amino acid sequences of both proteins using a program that compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases. Little similarities were found – a finding confirmed by Pfizer.
Eduardo Hariton, a clinical fellow in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the co-authors of the article, told FactCheck.org the researchers published their results after having to constantly reassure worried colleagues, friends and family members that there was no basis to these claims. 
“What they were claiming is that because the COVID spike protein looks like syncytin-1, by training your immune system against the COVID protein, your body would attack syncytin-1. And that is not correct because when you look at the genetic sequences of the spike protein and syncytin-1 there is not that much overlap. So even if that was the case, you would not expect the COVID vaccine to train your body to attack syncytin-1, because they’re just so different,” he said. 
Several scientists have proved the same: The similarities of both proteins are too small for the immune system to be confused by the two. In fact, they are as similar as the spike protein could be to other proteins abundant in the body. Therefore, even if the immune system could be confused, scientists would have already seen related issues in patients who have had COVID-19 or in people who have received the vaccine. That hasn’t happened. Pfizer has said that the spike protein targeted by its vaccine only shared a sequence of four amino acids with syncytin-1, which is made up of 538 amino acids.
“These proteins are extremely divergent and do not look anything like one another,” Alice Lu-Culligan, a medical student and Ph.D. candidate  in the department of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, told us. Lu-Culligan co-authored an opinion piece in the New York Times with her professor Akiko Iwasaki debunking Wodarg and Yeadon’s claim as “completely false.” 
In addition to analyzing the amino acid sequence alignments of the coronavirus protein and the syncytin-1 protein, Lu-Culligan and Iwasaki evaluated serum from women with COVID-19. They found no reaction between antibodies for the coronavirus and the syncytin-1 protein. Lu-Culligan, who has been investigating the impact of maternal antiviral responses on fetal development during pregnancy, said that based on the history of vaccines, the plausibility of the COVID-19 vaccines leading to infertility is “extremely unlikely.” 
Other types of vaccines are deemed safe and are recommended to those trying to conceive because they help prevent serious complications during pregnancy. Unvaccinated pregnant individuals who get infected with the flu, for example, are at risk of miscarriage, premature labor, serious lung infection and even death.
With men, experts have observed a short-term impact on sperm count, but Hariton said that’s common for other infections that cause fever.
Should Pregnant or Lactating Women Get The Vaccine?
Update, Aug. 16: Citing more accumulated safety data, including an analysis of outcomes of pregnant people enrolled in v-safe, another vaccine surveillance system, the CDC recommended on Aug. 11 that pregnant people be vaccinated. The new CDC study, not yet peer-reviewed or published, found no increased risk of miscarriage with vaccination. “The increased circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant, the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever,” the CDC said in its statement.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine had already strongly recommended vaccination for all pregnant people on July 30, given evidence “demonstrating the safe use of the COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy from tens of thousands of reporting individuals over the last several months, as well as the current low vaccination rates and concerning increase in cases.” 
There’s limited data on vaccine safety for pregnant women because they were excluded from the first clinical trials of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. So for now, the recommendation for pregnant women is to discuss it with their clinical team and evaluate the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated.

Pregnant individuals are not more likely to get COVID-19, but they are at increased risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 than those who are not. According to the CDC, a pregnant COVID-19 patient is more likely to need hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation than a COVID-19 patient who’s not pregnant. Pregnant COVID-19 patients also experience preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes more frequently than healthy expecting parents.
Based on that knowledge, and the way mRNA vaccines work, experts in reproductive health from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend not withholding vaccines from pregnant and breastfeeding individuals who are eligible, and allowing patients to make their own decision. But they don’t unequivocally recommend them, as they would do with other kinds of vaccines that are proved to be safe. 
What experts know so far is that because mRNA vaccines do not contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there’s no risk for the carrier or the infant to get COVID-19. Because the body eliminates the mRNA quickly, it’s unlikely for those particles to reach the placenta. And side effects, such as fever or allergic reactions, are rare but possible. Whether maternal immune response to infection protects the fetus, remains unknown.  
“The risk of getting COVID in pregnancy puts the maternal health and the fetal health at much greater risk than any theoretical risk from vaccination,” said Dr. Feinberg, from ASRM’s Coronavirus/COVID-19 Task Force. 
The World Health Organization guidelines for pregnant individuals are less clear. The WHO states that “we don’t have any specific reason to believe there will be risks that would outweigh the benefits of vaccination for pregnant women” based on the little vaccine safety data available. It says those at high risk of exposure or who have comorbidities “may be vaccinated in consultation with their health care provider.”
According to the CDC, there are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women nor on the effects on milk production or the breastfed infant. The recommendation of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is to therefore balance potential risks with potential benefits, even though it says a vaccine is “unlikely to have any biological effects.” 
“During lactation, it is unlikely that the vaccine lipid would enter the bloodstream and reach breast tissue. If it does, it is even less likely that either the intact nanoparticle or mRNA transfer into milk. In the unlikely event that mRNA is present in milk, it would be expected to be digested by the child and would be unlikely to have any biological effects,” a statement on its website reads. 
On the other hand, the ABM says “antibodies and T-cells stimulated by the vaccines may passively transfer into milk” and protect the infant from infection. 
A recent post viewed by over 88,000 people, baselessly claims that the vaccine is causing miscarriages and premature births. The article posted on Feb. 23 by Children’s Health Defense — an organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was banned from Instagram for spreading vaccine misinformation — uses unsubstantiated information attributed to the National Vaccine Information Center, which is not an official government agency, as we have reported before, but an antivaccine organization.
According to the publication, the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has received 111 reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine in pregnant individuals. But the story cites data published by MedAlerts, an alternative to VAERS search engine run by the National Vaccine Information Center, not the CDC. In any case, as we’ve explained before, VAERS data is unvetted and raw. Anyone can submit a report, but that doesn’t mean the adverse event or illness can be linked to the vaccines as reports could be incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental or unverifiable.
On Feb. 26, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, with the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force Vaccine Safety Team, said there had been 154 reports of adverse reactions in pregnant women to VAERS and 55 million vaccine doses administered as of Feb. 16.
Most of those events, 73%, were not specifically related to pregnancy — such as headache,  fatigue, chills, pain in extremity, nausea, dizziness or injection site pain. Of the 42 events directly related to pregnancy, 29 were spontaneous abortions or miscarriage. But according to Shimabukuro’s presentation to a panel discussing the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine candidate, that number was in line with pregnancy loss for the general population. Early pregnancy loss for women aged 20-30 years is 9% to17%, with that rate increasing sharply from 20% at age 35, to 40% at age 40, and 80% at age 45. The median maternal age in the VAERS reports was 33. 
“The frequency of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage is actually quite common , 10 to 20% based on age,” he said. “The number was not concerning considering the expected background rate.” 
On Feb. 10, the National Institutes of Health called for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating people in COVID-19 vaccine research. Reproductive health experts have also advocated to include pregnant individuals in vaccine trials in order to have more data for people to make informed decisions. On Feb. 18, Pfizer and BioNTech announced they would start evaluating their vaccine in pregnant individuals. The goal is to enroll a total of about 4,000 healthy pregnant people in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, South Africa, U.K. and Spain. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the third COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized by the FDA, is also planning to include pregnant women in their trials. 
“More research needs to be done, and we are doing that research,” Hariton, who is part of a team at the University of California, San Francisco, conducting a nationwide study on pregnancy and COVID-19, told us. They are trying to recruit 10,000 pregnant individuals. 
“That being said, we don’t know about the long-term effects of COVID and we don’t know about the long-term effects of the vaccine, but it is much more likely that the long-term effects of COVID are going to be much worse than the long-term effects of the vaccines,” he said.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ recommends that pregnant women who choose to get vaccinated should get their shots in authorized sites, complete the two-dose series with the same vaccine product, refrain from getting other vaccines 14 days before and after the COVID-19 vaccine, and to treat any fever following vaccination with acetaminophen.",Catalina Jaramillo,2021-02-26 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"In January, a group of independent reproductive health experts published an article in ASRM’s Fertility and Sterility, stating that the vaccine “contains neither syncytin-1 nor the mRNA sequence for syncytin-1.”

In the last two weeks, Trump has offered tepid endorsement for masks, saying: “The mask, perhaps, helps.” He has also raised doubts about the science, noting that health experts who now advocate public mask-wearing were once opposed to it. “I guess I’m somewhere in the middle,” Trump said recently. And: “I understand both sides of the argument.”
“There are a lot of people think that masks are not good,” Trump said at a town hall on Sept. 15. Adding at a press conference the next day, “Masks have problems, too.”
He has repeatedly mocked Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s appearance in a mask and for wearing one in circumstances that Trump doesn’t think is necessary. He also accused one reporter of being “politically correct” for declining to take off his mask to ask a question.
And, of course, the president has continued to hold densely packed rallies where many supporters are not wearing masks. Trump has said little to discourage them. For example, Trump held an indoor rally in Nevada on Sept. 13 in defiance of the governor’s order limiting the size of gatherings. Press reports noted that few in the densely packed crowd wore masks, though Trump made no mention of the subject.
We reviewed all of Trump’s comments going back to April 3 when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for public mask-wearing. Announcing the new guidance that day, Trump repeatedly reminded that the recommendation was voluntary and that he personally would not be wearing a mask. In the following months, his position on masks remained lukewarm — saying he had “no problem” with mask-wearing — but refusing to be seen wearing one himself.
His stance evolved some over the summer, as the coronavirus continued to spread around the country. On July 20, he released a photo of himself in a mask. And he repeatedly made unequivocal calls for the public to wear masks, particularly when he appeared to be reading from prepared notes. But his waffling returned late in the summer around the time he began to stage rallies.
Since then, his public comments have been inconsistent, toggling between advocacy and casting doubt, sometimes in the same speech or interview.
Azar’s Spin
In an interview with Azar on Sept. 24, the “Today” show’s Savannah Guthrie said Trump’s statements on masks have been “all over the place,” and she asked Azar if masks are “going to make this pandemic less terrible than it is, basically.” (Starting at the 6:40 mark.)
“Masks are important,” Azar said. “We have been clear since the, the president has been clear since his April guidance on reopening the economy.”
When Guthrie responded that Trump “hasn’t been clear,” Azar referred to the government’s coronavirus.gov website. “It’s right there, coronavirus.gov, the president’s guidance on reopening: wear face coverings when you can’t social distance. Very clear. He says it, I say it, every health leader says it.”
When Guthrie countered, asking if Trump’s voice wasn’t louder than a government website, Azar again said, “Well, he says it. I say it. The FDA, CDC, NIH, that’s all we talk about is ‘Wear face coverings when you cannot social distance.’”
The government’s guidance has been “clear and unambiguous,” Azar said: “Wear your face coverings when you can’t be socially distant.”
The official government messaging may be consistent, but as we said, the president’s rhetoric is not. In an interview just two days prior, Trump said the guidance from health experts was originally for the public not to wear masks. After scientists began to learn more about the asymptomatic spread of the virus, that guidance changed. But Trump often brings up this change in position from the scientific community, as he did in an interview on Sept. 22, to express doubts about mask-wearing.
“Everybody was talking about like masks were a bad thing. Then they come like masks are the greatest thing you can do,” Trump said. “You know, you get all these different messages. And I guess I’m somewhere in the middle, to be honest with you.”
CDC’s April Guidance
As Trump has often pointed out, members of the scientific community — including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams — were in the early months of 2020 telling the general public not to wear face masks.
However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and recommended that people begin “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” (Trump on Feb. 7 acknowledged privately in an interview recently made public that he knew the virus is transmitted through the air and it’s much deadlier than the flu.)
In a coronavirus task force briefing in which the new CDC recommendation was announced, Trump repeatedly stressed that the CDC’s recommendation was voluntary, and that he wouldn’t personally be following it.
Trump, April 3: In light of these studies [on asymptomatic spread], the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it. They suggested for a period of time. But this is voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it …
So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay. It may be good. Probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation. It’s voluntary.
Adams, the surgeon general, went into detail at the press conference about why the change to recommending public use of masks was made.
“Well, it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms,” Adams said. “They’re what we call asymptomatic. And that even those who eventually become pre-symptomatic, meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future, can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity: for example, coughing, speaking, or sneezing, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends and the task force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These include places like grocery stores and pharmacies. We especially recommend this in areas of significant community-based transmission. It is critical.”
The official White House messaging — aside from Trump — has been consistent since then in advocating for the public to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.
‘No Problem’ with Masks
In the ensuing weeks, Trump repeatedly said he had “no problem with face masks,” but that he would leave it up to states’ governors to decide whether to mandate their use. He also said he, personally, would “have no problem wearing a mask,” if the conditions were appropriate. Trump told reporters he wore a mask briefly while touring Honeywell in early May, though the press did not see it, or photograph it.
On May 11, Trump told reporters that he had begun requiring that White House staffers wear masks. But during the same press conference, Trump said the public had “learned about facemasks — the good and the bad, by the way. It’s not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.”
On June 20, Trump held an indoor rally in Tulsa. Although there was little social distancing and few in the relatively sparse crowd wore masks, Trump made no appeal to the crowd to wear masks. To the contrary, Trump complained only that the media did not highlight when Black Lives Matter protesters were not wearing masks.
In an interview on July 1 on the Fox Business Network, Trump said he’d “absolutely” wear a mask “if I were in a tight situation with people.” And he said he had worn a mask and liked the way it looked on him. “It was a dark black mask, and I thought it looked OK,” Trump said. “Looked like the Lone Ranger.”
Trump again added that he had “no problem” with masks “and if people feel good about it, they should do it.”
Raising Doubts
In a telephone interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on July 9, Trump again brought up the reversal by the scientific community on masks, and framed it as an ongoing debate (even though by then there was consensus from his health advisers advocating public mask-wearing).
“They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks,” Trump said. “Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don’t wear a mask, don’t wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask. So, a lot of mistakes were made, a lot of mistakes.”
Trump added that “it’s fine to wear a mask, if it makes you feel comfortable” and that mask-wearing was appropriate in some situations, like when someone visits a hospital.
During the interview, Trump took the opportunity to ridicule Biden for the way he wears his masks, and for wearing one even when he is socially distanced from others. It became a familiar refrain for Trump in interviews and speeches.
Trump, July 9: I watched Biden walk onto a stage with his — practically — like, today, there was almost nobody in the room. He’s making a speech. And they have these massive circles. And the circles are very far away from each other to start off with. And then they have just a few people in the audience. And he makes a speech. And he walks onto the stage wearing this massive mask. There’s nobody on the stage. And then he takes it off. He likes to have it hang off usually the left ear. I think it makes him feel good, frankly, if you want to know the truth. And I guess that’s OK. But when there’s nobody around, you don’t really have to do that. But he feels it’s good. And I’m OK with it, if he wants to do that. He’s got the largest mask I think I have ever seen. It covers up a big proportion of his face. And I think he feels he looks good that way.


Biden has defended his decision to wear masks in those situations, saying it is part of “setting the example that I’ve tried to set since this began, of being responsible.”
Trump was finally photographed in a mask two days later while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a CBS interview on July 14, Trump said he felt an “obligation” to wear a mask in the hospital, because some patients had just come out of operations, and he wanted to be close to them.
Asked if he would tell the American people to wear a mask, Trump hedged.
Trump, July 14: Well, I’d say listen to that instruction, listen to your governors. But I have to say the same people that say wear a mask are people that said, a long time ago, don’t wear a mask, masks are bad. They said they’re not good. So, you know, like Dr. Fauci, surgeon general, a lot of people — a lot of people — the surgeon general said that also.
And right now that [the CDC guideline] is saying wear a mask, and that’s okay with me. That’s good. Those guidelines are good. I’m not stopping them from saying it. I do say this, originally people were saying don’t wear a mask. People that we all respect were saying don’t wear a mask because, look, you know, it’s got certain drawbacks and they say don’t wear a mask. Now they’re saying wear a mask. I’m okay. And it does evolve. You know, I mean, the thought process evolves. So let’s see what happens.
In an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace four days later, Trump offered this mixed message: “I don’t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our surgeon general — terrific guy — said don’t wear a mask. Everybody who is saying don’t wear a mask — all of sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors.”
Wearing Masks ‘Patriotic’
Perhaps Trump’s strongest appeal for mask-wearing came via a tweet on July 20, in which he suggested it was patriotic to don one.

We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com/iQOd1whktN
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2020

In a press conference the following day, Trump continued his full-throated advocacy for masks.
Trump, July 21: We’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They’ll have an effect. And we need everything we can get. …
If you’re close to each other, if you’re in a group, I would put it on. …
I view it this way: Anything that potentially can help — and that certainly can potentially help — is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. … I’m getting used to the mask, and the reason is — think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps.
Now, we have experts that have said, in the recent past, that masks aren’t necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they’ve changed their mind. If they change their mind, that’s good enough for me.


In an interview the following day on Fox News, Trump continued to lobby for mask-use.
“I believe that you should wear it, even if there’s a 1% chance it helps,” Trump said. “You know, when you look at Dr. Fauci and others — and this isn’t a knock, because this is just the way it — if you look, early on, they were all saying, don’t wear a mask. Don’t wear a mask. That didn’t make total sense to me, but don’t wear a mask. Now they’re all saying, wear a mask. My attitude is, it probably helps. Give it a shot, because we have to win this thing. So, it’s not a question of pride. It’s not a question of anything. We have to win this. So, when you’re in a certain situation, I think you should wear a mask.”
In more than a half dozen coronavirus press briefings from late July through mid-August Trump was consistently unequivocal in calling for the public to “wear a mask if you cannot socially distance.”
In a TV interview on Aug. 4, Trump said, “People question masks, but there’s no downside in wearing them.”
In a coronavirus briefing on Aug. 13, Trump tried to draw a distinction between his approach and Biden’s on masks, claiming that Biden wanted a federal mask mandate, while he has left it up to states to decide. (Biden in August said, “Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing.” He later clarified that “there’s a constitutional issue whether federal government could issue such a mandate. I don’t think constitutionally they could, so I wouldn’t issue a mandate.”)
“My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks,” Trump said. “And I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do. Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good. Maybe they’re not so good. But frankly, what do you have to lose?”
In a campaign speech in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 20, Trump said, “Do the masks. I mean, it’s just not going to hurt. Do them. Do them. If you feel it, do them.”
Back to Waffling
Trump resumed his in-person rallies in September, and with them began his hedging on masks.
In a campaign speech in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 3, Trump was back to mocking Biden for the way he wears his masks, and when.
“I’ve never seen a man that like the mask more,” Trump said of Biden. “Look, I’m all for it … but did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always but a lot of times he has it hanging down because you know what, it gives him a feeling of security. If I were a psychiatrist — right? No, I would say — I would say this guy has got some big issues.”
And Trump’s waffling on using masks returned in an ABC News town hall on Sept. 15.
“But whether it’s Dr. Fauci or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong,” Trump said. “They talked about don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks. Although some people say don’t wear masks. I mean you have a lot of different ideas.”
“Now there are, by the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks,” Trump said later. “There are a lot of people think that masks are not good.”
Trump went on to talk about waiters who touch their masks “and then they’re touching the plate. That can’t be good. … The concept of a mask is good, but it also does … you’re constantly touching it, you’re touching your face, you’re touching plates. There are people that don’t think masks are good.”
In a press briefing the next day, Trump continued to express doubt about the efficacy of wearing masks, and then later said he thought they work.
Trump’s comments came in response to a question about Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield testified about masks, saying: “We have clear scientific evidence they work, and they are our best defense. I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine.”
Trump challenged that comment, saying, “Number one, it’s not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine.”
“On masks — masks have problems, too,” Trump said. “And I talked about the masks about to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that, in restaurants, they have people with masks and they’re playing around with their mask, and they have it — their fingers are in their mask and then they’re serving with plates. I mean, I think there’s a lot of problems with masks.”
“The mask, perhaps, helps,” Trump said minutes later. “Don’t forget: A lot of people didn’t like the concept of masks initially. Dr. Fauci didn’t like them, and a lot of people didn’t. And I’m not knocking anybody, because I understand both sides of the argument.”
At a campaign rally in Bedmidji, Minnesota, on Sept. 18, Trump argued that he ought to call his rallies a protest, to get around mask-restrictions.
“You don’t have to wear masks at protests,” Trump claimed. “So I said, ‘You know, we can’t have a rally.’ The most we can have is 10 people, but why don’t we just call it a protest because this is a protest. It’s a protest against stupidity. ”
In an interview with a local Fox station in Detroit on Sept. 22, the reporter noted that at some recent Trump rallies, there appeared to be many people “almost celebrating the fact that they didn’t have to wear a mask.”
Trump said he “didn’t see that.”
“No I think people should wear a mask if they can, if they feel they can, they should,” Trump added. “But I don’t think it should be a mandatory policy.”
“But when you look out into the audience when you’re doing these rallies, and you see the number of people who don’t have masks, does that concern you about the future and this fall?” the reporter asked.
“I must be honest, I see a lot of people with masks,” Trump said. “I also see a little bit of a spreading out. One of the reasons I do the rallies in outside settings is because it’s much better. It’s, you know, recommended. I don’t know if they know what they’re recommending, but they recommend being outside like we’re outside right now.”
In an interview with WGN America at the White House the same day, Trump was again pressed about whether he was concerned about so many maskless people at rallies being exposed to COVID-19.
“No,” Trump said. “Because my supporters are very smart and they do, a lot of them wear masks and some don’t, that’s their choice. But they’re, you know, when you’re outside, you have a lot of room, and everything that I’ve read and everything that I’ve seen is outside is better in terms of COVID or as I call it the China virus.”
Trump accused the CDC of sending mixed messages on masks.
“You know, at one point they were saying, don’t wear a mask,” Trump said. “Dr. Fauci said, don’t wear a mask — everybody was talking about like masks were bad thing. Then they come like masks are the greatest thing you can do. You know, you get all these different messages. And I guess I’m somewhere in the middle, to be honest with you.”
“There is a mixed message there,” Trump said. “But if you remember the original message was don’t wear masks.”
Azar is right that the White House messaging has been “clear and unambiguous” — and consistent since early April — that people should wear a mask when they can’t social distance. But as the many comments above reflect, the president has not always been “clear” in delivering that message.

94,The COVID-19 Recession Officially Ended Before Biden Took Office,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/the-covid-19-recession-officially-ended-before-biden-took-office/,,"The recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic officially lasted just two months and ended in April 2020. But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrongly credited President Joe Biden for guiding “this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.”
Buttigieg made his remarks on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while answering a question about the supply chain disruptions that have caused delays in the delivery of consumer goods. The transportation secretary responded by saying high consumer demand — which has caused bottleneck delays at U.S. shipping ports — is a sign of a strengthening economy.
Buttigieg, Oct. 17: Demand is off the charts. Retail sales are through the roof. And if you think about those images of ships, for example, waiting at anchor on the West Coast, you know, every one of those ships is full of record amounts of goods that Americans are buying, because demand is up, because income is up, because the president has successfully guided this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.
It’s true Biden inherited a weakened economy not fully recovered from the recession. As we noted in our story “What President Biden Inherits,” the newly inaugurated president on Jan. 20 took over an “economy struggling with 10 million jobless and millions more out of the workforce.”
In September the number of people with jobs was still about 5 million below the pre-recession peak, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But Biden didn’t guide the U.S. “out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.”
Technically, economists put the end of the recession — and the start of the current expansion of business activity — nine months before Biden took office.
The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that the COVID-19-induced recession lasted just two months — from March through April 2020 — making it the shortest recession on record.
Previously, the shortest recession on record occurred during the first six months of 1980. The NBER committee said its traditional definition of a recession is one that lasts more than a couple of months, but the circumstances last year were unique.
“[T]he committee concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warranted the designation of this episode as a recession, even though the downturn was briefer than earlier contractions,” the NBER committee said, explaining the recent recession.
The NBER determines recessions based on economy-wide measures of economic activity, which reached a low point in April 2020. “May 2020 was the first month of the subsequent expansion,” the NBER committee said in its July release.
One key measure considered by the NBER when determining U.S. business cycles is real personal income excluding transfers, such as government benefits from the COVID-19 stimulus programs.
“The deduction of transfers is necessary because transfers are included in personal income but do not arise from production. This measure reached a clear trough in April 2020,” the NBER committee said in a statement on the end of the recession. (See the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis chart below that shows the steep decline in income from production in April 2020.)

 
Real personal income excluding transfers hasn’t quite fully recovered, but it was on its way to a full recovery by the time Biden took office. Other economic measures, too, saw relatively swift — but not full — recoveries.
After two quarters of economic contraction, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the nation’s economy grew 33.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and 4.5% in the fourth, when Donald Trump was president. And the unemployment rate – which was 14.8% in April 2020 – was 6.3% when Biden took over.
The unemployment rate has continued to recover, falling to 4.8% as of September, still a bit higher than the pre-recession rate of 3.5%.
Like anyone else, Buttigieg is entitled to his opinion on Biden’s handling of the economy. But he’s wrong to say the president “successfully guided this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession.” It was over before Biden took office.

95,Video: Highlights of the VP Debate,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/video-highlights-of-the-vp-debate/,,"In this video, we review some of the claims Sen. Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence made during the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7.


Harris falsely claimed Trump’s China trade war cost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. The U.S. gained 146,000 factory jobs during the first 18 months after the tariffs took effect.
Pence suggested that it’s unknown what is causing climate change. But scientists have a very good idea of what’s causing climate change: humans.
Harris said President Donald Trump had called the coronavirus “a hoax.” Trump said he was referring to Democrats finding fault with his administration’s response to the coronavirus, not the virus itself.
Pence repeated the false claim that the Obama administration left the Strategic National Stockpile “empty.” 
Pence claimed that Biden and Harris “want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking.” Biden’s climate change plan calls for a ban on new permitting on public land; most fracking occurs in non-public areas.

96,False Claim of Forced Removals Under Contact Tracing Bill,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/false-claim-of-forced-removals-under-contact-tracing-bill/,,"Quick Take
Viral posts on social media falsely claim that a House bill would “give the government the power to forcibly remove” children from their homes. That’s not true. The bill actually provides $100 billion to fund COVID-19 contact tracing efforts. 


Full Story 
A House bill that would fund organizations to trace and prevent COVID-19 infections has fueled a number of false and misleading claims on social media.
One of the most egregious misrepresentations is the suggestion that it would implement forced removals of children from their homes.
A bogus Facebook post, for example, claims the bill — unfortunately numbered H.R. 6666 — “will give the government the power to forcibly remove your family members from your home and quarantine them[.] That includes your children.”
A viral YouTube video similarly claims the legislation would “allow individuals to come into your house” and, if you have COVID-19 symptoms or test positive, “pull you or your loved ones, especially your children, away under pretense of public safety.”
But there is nothing in the bill’s current language dealing with forced removals, or giving anyone the authority to simply enter people’s homes without consent to conduct tests.
The bill — the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — outlines a $100 billion program to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants to “eligible entities,” such as health centers and clinics, universities and nonprofit organizations.
The federal money would be used by those organizations “to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through— (1) mobile health units; and (2) as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.”
Those provisions support the concept of contact tracing, a public health technique that, as we’ve previously explained, involves identifying those who have had contact with an infected person so that those people can be warned and ideally tested or quarantined.
According to the bill, the funds would be used by the recipient organizations “to hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals” and to “purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.” Organizations in hot spots — areas with cases of the novel coronavirus higher than the national average — and those in “medically underserved communities” would be given priority.
David Studdert, a Stanford University professor of law and medicine, told us in an email that “there is nothing in the text of the bill” supporting the claim about forced removals. He pointed to the bill’s language that explicitly supports “testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.” (Emphasis ours.)
The CDC calls contact tracing a “key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19,” and many public health experts have cited it as an important component, too.
An April report by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, for example, said a “case-based intervention approach … will be impossible to achieve for COVID-19 without a new national initiative that combines a massive expansion of rapid diagnostic tests in every community with an unprecedented growth in a public health workforce and adoption of new technologies dedicated to case identification and contact tracing in each state.”
“In order to trace all contacts, safely isolate the sick, and quarantine those exposed, we estimate that our public health workforce needs to add approximately 100,000 (paid or volunteer) contact tracers to assist with this large-scale effort,” the report says.
It’s worth noting that existing state laws — and, to a lesser extent, federal law and regulations — already provide the government the authority to mandate quarantine or isolation to curb the spread of communicable diseases. But they’re not without limits or challenges.
“In broad strokes, the state can involuntarily isolate a person who is both sick and dangerous to the community,” Nicole Huberfeld, a Boston University professor of health law, ethics and human rights, told us in an email. “A number of judicial decisions have been issued over time that pertain to isolating a person who has, for example, drug-resistant TB, and they consistently have held that the person must have both characteristics to be lawfully held.”
“Additionally, courts consistently have held that government must meet both procedural requirements and substantive requirements to involuntarily isolate a person,” she said.
Huberfeld said “courts apply procedural due process standards” afforded under the Constitution to ensure they have a right to understand and oppose the decision before commitment. She added that the state must meet the “substantive standards” under the Fourth Amendment, too — “meaning that government bears the burden of proving a person is both ill and dangerous to the community before she could be involuntarily isolated to avoid running afoul of the prohibition against ‘unreasonable seizure.'”
Someone forced to isolate retains the right to refuse medical treatment, Huberfeld noted, though that could potentially prolong the isolation.
None of this is changed by the current language in H.R. 6666 — which was introduced May 1 and is still before a House committee. As we said, there is no language in the bill proposing to “forcibly remove” individuals or children. And Huberfeld said the legislation does not affect the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable search and seizures — meaning contact tracers wouldn’t be able to just enter homes without consent to conduct tests, as the YouTube video suggests.
The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, has attempted to counter misconceptions about the bill on Twitter.
In a radio and Facebook Live interview on May 12, Rush said (at 1:17:12): “It’s all volunteer. There’s nothing about this bill that says that the government is going to come into your home and snatch your children … or snatch you out of the home. There’s nothing that remotely even hints at that.”
Another erroneous post claims the bill will give funding only to entities that “agree by contract that they will only allow people in their facilities that have the covid 19 vaccination, are tested and tracked.” There is no mention of vaccines, let alone contracts stipulating mandatory vaccinations, in the bill.

97,CDC Did Not ‘Admit Only 6%’ of Recorded Deaths from COVID-19,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/cdc-did-not-admit-only-6-of-recorded-deaths-from-covid-19/,,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t drastically reduced the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, but posts making that bogus claim have been circulating widely — with the help of President Donald Trump, who retweeted one such claim on Aug. 30.
Twitter has since removed the original tweet, which came from an account dedicated to the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon. But the claim is still readily available on all the major social media platforms. In fact, the same QAnon account that posted the now-deleted tweet includes a screenshot version featuring the president’s retweet.
The post Trump highlighted said: “This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid. That’s 9,210 deaths. The other 94% had 2 to 3 other serious illnesses and the overwhelming majority were of very advanced age.”
But that’s not what the CDC information says.
In weekly updates provided on the CDC’s website, the agency includes information on additional conditions present in patients who died with COVID-19. These other illnesses or conditions found to be present in a patient are called comorbidities. The agency also includes a chart detailing the number of patients with each additional condition.
For the week referenced in the claim, the CDC explained that the chart “shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned.”
That means that 6% of those who died with COVID-19 through Aug. 15 didn’t have any other reported conditions.
It does not mean that the CDC has “quietly updated” the number of deaths associated with COVID-19 to a fraction of what had been reported. It’s also not new information; the agency has been providing the same information since May.
Asked about Trump’s tweet during a press briefing on Aug. 31, though, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “he was highlighting new CDC information that came out that was worth noting.”
At that time, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. had passed 183,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, and the total number of cases across the country had passed 6 million.
McEnany said that the president was not trying to downplay the death toll.
The following morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, clarified what the CDC data mean.
He noted that the 6% figure includes cases where COVID-19 was listed as the only cause of death. “That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn’t die of Covid-19. They did,” Fauci said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”
“So the numbers you’ve been hearing — the 180,000-plus deaths — are real deaths from Covid-19. Let [there] not be any confusion about that,” Fauci said.
Other versions of the claim are misleading, rather than being strictly false. One example is a headline on the conservative outlet Gateway Pundit, which announced: “This Week CDC Quietly Updated COVID-19 Numbers – Only 9,210 Americans Died From COVID-19 Alone – Rest Had Different Other Serious Illnesses.”
The president retweeted a link to that, too, and the phrase “only 6%” trended on Twitter.
Several media outlets flipped the percentage and reported that 94% of COVID-19 deaths had “underlying medical conditions.”
But the data on which all of this is based come from death certificates, which list any causes or conditions that contributed to a person’s death. In the case of COVID-19, the disease often causes other serious conditions, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Those two conditions are among the ailments with the highest counts in the CDC’s comorbidity chart. Some long-term conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19, such as diabetes or hypertension, were also listed.
The underlying cause of death, however, is the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death. In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, that disease is listed as the underlying cause of death, Jeff Lancashire, spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told FactCheck.org in an email.
As the epidemiologist and science writer Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz explained in a recent post, “it’s pretty rare that someone wouldn’t have at least one issue caused by coronavirus prior to their death, and all it means is that in 94% of cases people who had COVID-19 also developed other issues, or had other problems at the same time.”
Meyerowitz-Katz notes that influenza and pneumonia are listed as the most common concurrent diseases, which isn’t surprising. “Similarly,” he writes, “respiratory failure, something that the coronavirus directly causes, is listed here as a ‘comorbidity’ that 55,000 people had.”
So, it’s misleading to say that 94% of those who died with COVID-19 also had other ailments without explaining that the disease causes other serious illnesses. And it’s wrong to claim that only 6% of the recorded COVID-19 deaths were caused by the disease.
Update, Sept. 2: In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham that aired Sept. 1, Trump made this false claim himself, saying, “I saw a statistic come out the other day, talking about only 6% of the people actually died from COVID, which is a very interest[ing], that they died for — from other reasons.”
Ingraham corrected him, explaining that those who die from COVID-19 often have other conditions, but COVID-19 “might ultimately have been the key morbidity.”
“But it’s an interesting statistic,” Trump responded.

98,Meme Spreads Falsehood About Vaccine Transfer Through Eating Meat,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-meme-spreads-falsehood-about-vaccine-transfer/,,"
We’ve already explained why some earlier claims about COVID-19 vaccine transfer were false. But a new claim has emerged on Instagram suggesting that eating meat from animals vaccinated against COVID-19 could transfer the inoculation.
The meme was first shared by an account that is selling a book titled “Detoxing The Rona Shot,” which is based on the false claim that the COVID-19 vaccines “put nano magnetic gene computers in everyone.” We’ve already addressed several other claims about microchips in the vaccines.
The recent meme claims, “IF YOU ARE EATING FARM RAISED MEAT THE ANIMALS ARE BEING VAXXED SO U R VAXXED.” The account that posted it wrote in the comments, “In their mind they are protecting animals from a deadly disease. Animals get the alleged covid too. Vaccinating them is just protection.”
First of all, livestock isn’t being vaccinated against COVID-19.
“It’s simply not happening,” Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, said in a phone interview. He knew of no countries that were vaccinating livestock for COVID-19.
In the U.S., there are no COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in livestock and there are no federal recommendations that livestock should be vaccinated against COVID-19, Lyndsay Cole, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, told us in an email.
APHIS regulates veterinary vaccines in the U.S., and it put out a call in November for COVID-19 vaccines that could be used in mink. Outbreaks of the disease on mink farms had been reported in multiple countries last year, including the U.S., which caused concern since mink could act as a reservoir for the virus to mutate and then be passed back to humans as a new variant.
In contrast to mink, which the World Organisation for Animal Health lists as highly susceptible to the virus that causes COVID-19, two of the major types of livestock in the U.S. — cattle and hogs — are listed as having “extremely low” susceptibility. Poultry is listed as having no susceptibility.
The virus’ effect on animals continues to be studied, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently says that the risk of spread from most animals is low.
Following APHIS’ request in November, at least two U.S. companies — Zoetis and Medgene Labs — began developing vaccines that could be used in mink. Zoetis announced on July 2 that its vaccine had been authorized for experimental use on a case-by-case basis for various animals in some zoos and sanctuaries. The vaccine has not been fully licensed and is not commercially available, company spokeswoman Christina Lood told us in a phone interview.
Medgene is still in the development phase of its vaccine, company spokesman Jason Melby told us in a phone interview.
Both companies are pursuing a subunit type of vaccine, Lood and Melby said. That means that the vaccines are introducing a small, inactive piece of the virus that causes COVID-19 in order to trigger an immune response in the recipient.
Russia also has reportedly developed a COVID-19 vaccine for animals, which was tested on dogs, cats, foxes and mink.
It’s also worth noting that, according to a list of COVID-19 policies on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website, no countries have implemented programs to vaccinate livestock against COVID-19.
Vaccines Aren’t Transferred Through Meat
Beyond the fact that livestock and poultry aren’t getting the COVID-19 vaccine, experts we spoke to said that it wouldn’t be possible for the vaccine to be transmitted through consumption of meat, anyway.
“These animals have always been given a lot of vaccines,” Kuchipudi said, and none of them pass on to those who eat the resulting meat. “That’s not how they transfer,” he said.
That would be true for subunit vaccines, like the ones Zoetis and Medgene are developing, and for the mRNA vaccines that account for the majority of shots administered to people in the U.S., he said.
The meme doesn’t specify which type of vaccine is supposedly being administered to livestock.
“It just simply can’t happen,” John Wherry, chair of the department of systems pharmacology and translational therapeutics and director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology at the Perelman School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. “It doesn’t work that way.”
Referring to the messenger RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, Wherry explained that once the mRNA gets into a cell, it doesn’t propagate any further — meaning it doesn’t spread from one cell to another.
And as we’ve explained before, the mRNA passes on instructions to make antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19, then is quickly broken down and leaves the body.
“Even if you ate” the vaccine, Wherry said, it wouldn’t work.
It would be doubly impossible to get the vaccine from meat, he said, since cooking it would inactivate the RNA.
Gary Whittaker, professor of virology at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, agreed. He told us in an email that, in his view, it would be impossible for an mRNA vaccine to be transmitted through meat consumption.
“The RNA is just too unstable to survive – hence the need for all the freezers for the vaccine,” he wrote.
Addressing how other types of vaccines may behave if they were given to livestock, Whittaker wrote, “An adenovirus-vaccine (J+J/AstraZeneca) would be more stable, but still extremely unlikely to survive processing. A live attenuated-vaccine (not currently used) could theoretically survive, at least until the meat is cooked – but in this case there are way bigger risks associated with eating raw meat!”
Although COVID-19 vaccines aren’t being given to livestock, as Penn State’s Kuchipudi said, a number of vaccines are commonly given to poultry and livestock for other viruses. And there are already rules in place for how much time must pass between when a vaccine is given and when an animal is slaughtered, often referred to as the withdrawal time.
This withdrawal period “ensures the end product is safe for consumption and no medication would be present in the beef,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association explained in a Q&A at the beginning of the pandemic.
Simply put, the claim that vaccines can be transferred by eating meat “doesn’t make any scientific sense,” Wherry said.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-07-15 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"In the U.S., there are no COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in livestock and there are no federal recommendations that livestock should be vaccinated against COVID-19, Lyndsay Cole, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, told us in an email.

99,Prank Posts Falsely Suggest Second Stimulus Payment Is Approved,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/prank-posts-falsely-suggest-second-stimulus-payment-is-approved/,,"Quick Take
Viral posts on Facebook falsely claim the government has approved a second round of coronavirus stimulus payments to everyone who signs up — and that the money will be forthcoming in “5-7 business days.” Congress is considering another economic package, but a new round of support has not been passed.
Full Story
A government stimulus package — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — was approved in March to help an economy crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The $2 trillion CARES Act most notably provided financial support in the form of $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals and dedicated $376 billion for small business relief.
High unemployment rates and the July 31 expiration of the $600-per-week unemployment payments authorized by the CARES Act have prompted Congress to consider another stimulus package.
On May 15, the House passed a $3 trillion Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES Act, which would distribute another round of federal stimulus checks of up to $1,200 to individuals and, among other measures, would expand the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses.
However, members of the Senate, who returned from recess on July 20, have indicated they will not pass the HEROES Act. Instead, they plan to propose their own stimulus package in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senate hopes to keep the cost in the $1 trillion range, which will limit the scope of the bill.
But before Congress has agreed on the elements of another economic support package, a new iteration of an old prank post is circulating on Facebook, falsely suggesting that a second round of federal stimulus payments is imminent.
The new post reads, “Everyone including essential workers will be compensated $1,000. The money will be available to u in 5-7 business days. Thank me later. Click the link to sign up.”
 When the link provided is clicked, up pops an image of a gorilla making an obscene gesture. 
Versions of the post use the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA – neither of which would be responsible for a second stimulus payment, we should note.
Another version of the bogus post show images of a check from the Treasury and the U.S. Capitol, and claims: “And it passed[.] WE GET ANOTHER STIMULUS CHECK FOR $2000 on August 10, 2020[.] Everyone including ESSENTIAL WORKERS will be compensated $2000[.] The money will be available to you in 5-7 business days.”
But the amount of any additional stimulus checks, who would be eligible, and when any payments would be made have not been determined.

100,Viral Post Falsely Attributed to Golfer Bubba Watson,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/viral-post-falsely-attributed-to-golfer-bubba-watson/,,"Quick Take
A viral post falsely attributed to PGA star Bubba Watson criticizes the Black Lives Matter movement and measures taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Watson has said the post “ain’t from me.” 

Full Story
Facebook posts falsely attribute remarks critical of the Black Lives Matter movement and public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to PGA Tour winner Bubba Watson. This is one of many false claims on social media linking famous people to partisan posts, which we’ve written about before.
An example of the viral post — versions of which began circulating widely on Facebook in the summer — begins: “HOORAY FOR BUBBA WATSON! He put into words what I think most of us are feeling. Thank you sir! This is from Bubba Watson… pro golfer and a stand up guy.” 
In reference to the protests after George Floyd’s death, the post says, “I’m so confused right now. I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I’m just trying to figure out which black lives matter.” 
The post also claims social distancing guidelines “wrecked the economy.” It says, “Only the experts can understand the data and math. What do you mean other cities/states/governors are interpreting the data differently? Pools are safe in Indiana, but not Michigan? Playgrounds are safe in your town but not mine?”
“Nothing adds up,” the post continues. “It’s one gigantic Math life problem, with ever changing denominators that I’m sure the media and politicians are eagerly ready to solve for us…until the next ‘crisis’.”
Watson wrote a Facebook post in July that says: “I’m not sure how or why my name ended up on the post, but it ain’t from me. I hadn’t seen it until I was asked about it.” 
Also, Facebook posts nearly identical to the bogus post appeared in June without being linked to Watson. 
The two-time Masters Champion has addressed racist symbolism in the past.
In 2012, Watson purchased the “General Lee,” the 1969 Dodge Charger made famous on the television show “The Dukes of Hazzard.” Watson painted an American flag over the Confederate flag on the roof of the car following the June 17, 2015, shooting of nine Black congregants at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Photos surfaced of the gunman with the Confederate flag, prompting the removal of the flag at some sites around the country.
Watson said at the time: “All my friends, nobody is offended by it, but now with all of the controversy going on, I felt like it was the right thing to do. Make a statement, make a gesture, whatever you want to call it.”

In 2012, Watson purchased the “General Lee,” the 1969 Dodge Charger made famous on the television show “The Dukes of Hazzard.” Watson painted an American flag over the Confederate flag on the roof of the car following the June 17, 2015, shooting of nine Black congregants at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. I’m just trying to figure out which black lives matter.” 
The post also claims social distancing guidelines “wrecked the economy.” It says, “Only the experts can understand the data and math. This is from Bubba Watson… pro golfer and a stand up guy.” 
In reference to the protests after George Floyd’s death, the post says, “I’m so confused right now. Watson said at the time: “All my friends, nobody is offended by it, but now with all of the controversy going on, I felt like it was the right thing to do."
101,Evidence Points to Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines for Pregnant People,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/06/scicheck-evidence-points-to-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines-for-pregnant-people/,,"
The United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union each have systems for reporting side effects that may have been caused by a vaccine.
The U.S. has the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS; the U.K. has Yellow Card; and the EU has EudraVigilance.
Anyone can submit a report to those systems, even if it’s not clear that the vaccine caused the problem. Public health officials use those submissions to detect patterns that may indicate potential safety issues or side effects.
All three systems clearly state that the information they record may not actually be related to the administered vaccine, but could, instead, be coincidental.
Despite that fact, social media posts present information from these systems as evidence to support an unsubstantiated claim that COVID-19 vaccines harm pregnancies. One headline that was shared on Instagram as a screenshot meme has been liked more than 72,000 times. It says: “920 Women Lose Their Unborn Babies After Getting Vaccinated.”
That post was shared by Shannon Kroner, who uses the title of doctor, although The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, where she got her degree, confirmed to us in a phone interview that she received a Ph.D. in psychology, not a medical degree. Kroner runs an organization that advocates for the right to use religious exemptions to avoid childhood vaccines. She did not return a call seeking comment about the claim.
The headline she shared came from a conservative website called The True Defender, which published a story taken largely from a British website that published the original claim and describes itself as an alternative to “the lying mainstream media.”
The original claim cited unverified reports submitted to VAERS, Yellow Card and EudraVigilance.
As we said, submissions to those systems are unverified and the reported issue is not necessarily related to the vaccine.
The VAERS website says: “A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine.”
Similarly, the U.K.’s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which runs Yellow Card, explained in a recent report: “The nature of Yellow Card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects. Some events may have happened anyway, regardless of vaccination. This is particularly the case when millions of people are vaccinated, and especially when most vaccines are being given to the most elderly people and people who have underlying illness.”
And the site for EudraVigilance, says (emphasis theirs): “The information on this website relates to suspected side effects, in other words, effects that have been observed following administration of, or treatment with, a medicine. However, these suspected side effects may not be related to or caused by the medicine.”
It’s also worth noting that, in the case of the VAERS data cited in the meme, most of the reported miscarriages happened in the first trimester. That’s the most common time for a miscarriage to happen and, according to the March of Dimes and the Mayo Clinic, about 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. The actual number is probably higher, though, since many women don’t know they’re pregnant at that early stage.
More importantly, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines pose a risk to pregnancy.
Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have noted that data is limited on this issue, but there have been no indications that the vaccines are dangerous to pregnant people. They both also note that animal studies showed no safety concerns for the pregnancy or the fetus.
Update, Aug. 16: Citing more accumulated safety data, including an analysis of outcomes of pregnant people enrolled in v-safe, another vaccine surveillance system, the CDC recommended on Aug. 11 that pregnant people be vaccinated. The new CDC study, not yet peer-reviewed or published, found no increased risk of miscarriage with vaccination. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine had already strongly recommended vaccination for all pregnant people on July 30, given evidence “demonstrating the safe use of the COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy from tens of thousands of reporting individuals over the last several months, as well as the current low vaccination rates and concerning increase in cases.”
Pregnant people were excluded from the clinical trials for the three vaccines available in the U.S., but some pregnancies occurred over the course of the trials and their outcomes were tracked. In the Pfizer/BioNTech trial, 23 pregnancies were reported with no miscarriages in the group that received the vaccine and one in the placebo group. Similarly, in the Moderna trial, there were 13 pregnancies and no miscarriages reported in the group that got the vaccine, with one miscarriage in the placebo group. And in the Johnson & Johnson trial, there were eight pregnancies and two miscarriages — one each in the vaccine and placebo groups.
Since then, studies have suggested that the vaccines are safe during pregnancy. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April evaluated data from more than 35,000 pregnant people who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and submitted reports to three different reporting systems — including VAERS. While it called for further study, the preliminary report found that there was no increased risk during pregnancy for those who received the vaccines.
Another study, published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology in May, found no evidence that those two vaccines would damage the placenta during pregnancy.
“[T]hese findings add to the growing literature supporting the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy,” it concluded.
Public health officials continue to gather information about the effect of the vaccines on pregnancy to capture any safety signals that might crop up.
Conversely, there is evidence that pregnant people are at an increased risk for pregnancy complications if they contract COVID-19. While the overall risk of severe illness is low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that “pregnant people with COVID-19 are at increased risk of preterm birth and might be at increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with pregnant women without COVID-19.”
Still, misinformation peddlers have continued to spread unsupported claims tying the vaccines to fertility issues. For more, see our SciCheck stories, “No Evidence Vaccines Impact Fertility” and “No Scientific Basis for Vaccine ‘Shedding’ Claims.”",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-06-11 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"This is particularly the case when millions of people are vaccinated, and especially when most vaccines are being given to the most elderly people and people who have underlying illness.”

102,China Didn’t Stop Virus ‘Cold’ Outside Wuhan,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/china-didnt-stop-virus-cold-outside-wuhan/,,"In remarks about SARS-CoV-2, President Donald Trump wrongly said China “stopped it cold” from spreading from Wuhan to other parts of China “but they didn’t stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world.” Trump called that “a little strange deal,” promising to seek answers.
But China did not stop the coronavirus from spreading from Wuhan, where it originated, to other parts of China. The number of reported cases and deaths in China’s major cities outside Wuhan have been far lower than the numbers in many European and American cities, but China also took extreme measures to slow the spread of the disease that the U.S. did not.
In the past, Trump has wrongly speculated that China stopped flights from Wuhan to the rest of China while continuing to allow flights from Wuhan all over the world, including to the U.S. But as we wrote, that’s not accurate, either.
More recently, Trump has not mentioned the stoppage of flights, but has simply said China suspiciously has not been hit as hard by the coronavirus as Europe and the U.S.
In a Fox News Radio interview on June 3, Trump asked why the coronavirus that came out of Wuhan “didn’t go to China but it went to the rest of the world,” including the U.S. Trump then attributed it to a purposeful act by China.
 Trump, June 3: And I ask this, “Why is it Wuhan, it came out of Wuhan. Why is it that it didn’t go to China but it went to the rest of the world? It went to Europe. It went to the world. It went to the United States. But it didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. What’s that all about? So how come they let it go out to the world, but they didn’t let it go into China. That’s a little strange deal going on there.”
In a press conference on June 8, Trump made similar comments.
Trump, June 8: And you do say, “How come at Wuhan, where it started …” And they were very badly — they were in bad trouble. But it didn’t go to any other parts. It didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. Then you say, “How come it came out to Europe, to the world, to the United States?” So it didn’t go to China; they stopped it cold. They knew it was a problem. But they didn’t stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Somebody has to ask these questions, and we’ll get down to the answer.
Many questions have been raised about China’s response to the coronavirus, and whether its leaders downplayed the threat or withheld information from world health officials. An in-depth report from the Associated Press on June 3 concluded that China delayed the release of coronavirus information to the World Health Organization, including the genome sequence of the virus. And, the article said, this lack of transparency came at a critical time, when it might have been possible to change the trajectory of the coronavirus death toll.
But Trump’s claim that China was able to stop the coronavirus “cold” from spreading outside Wuhan to other parts of China is inaccurate.
Cases Outside Wuhan
According to World Health Organization data, there were 81,048 confirmed cases in China of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as of March 15. While the vast majority of those cases were in Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, there were 13,254 cases outside Hubei (including 119 people who died). As for Beijing specifically, which the president mentioned, there were 442 confirmed cases and eight deaths by March 15.
As of that date, China led the world by far in the number of confirmed cases, while the U.S. had 5,702 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. In other words, at that time, there were more than double the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China, outside Hubei, than there were in the U.S.
In the following weeks, however, the picture changed dramatically, with cases in Europe and the U.S. spiraling upwards, and overtaking the number of confirmed cases in China (where the figures remained fairly constant).
We should note that Trump has questioned the data on cases coming from China. As the U.S. tally overtook China’s later in March, Trump said the U.S. numbers were “a tribute to our testing,” and he questioned the veracity of figures coming from China.
Trump, March 26: You know, number one, you don’t know what the numbers are in China. China tells you numbers, and — I’m speaking to President Xi tonight, I believe, and we’ll have a good conversation, I’m sure. But you just don’t know, you know, what are the numbers.
Trump isn’t alone in doubting China’s reported figures. A study from academics at the Hong Kong University School of Public Health, published in the Lancet, found that changing case definitions for COVID-19 by Chinese authorities led to a major undercount early in the outbreak. According to their research, although China reported about 55,500 confirmed cases on Feb. 20, the likely number of infections at that date was four times as high.
Even still, the confirmed cases in the U.S. have far surpassed the reported number of cases in China.
On June 9, as the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. approached 2 million, the number of reported cases in China — just over 84,000, including 594 cases and nine deaths in Beijing — hadn’t risen much from the reported figure in mid-March, according to data from Johns Hopkins.
Experts say the reason for that is less nefarious than Trump’s comments suggest.
According to research published in the Lancet on April 8, China implemented “massive public health interventions” in late January that helped to stem the spread of the virus. Those measures worked, researchers concluded. “The findings from our modelling impact assessment suggest that the comprehensive package of non-pharmaceutical interventions China undertook, including social distancing and population behavioural change, has substantially reduced transmissibility of COVID-19 across the country,” the authors wrote. 
On Jan. 23, China imposed severe travel restrictions on Wuhan, halting train and air travel from the bustling city of 11 million people. 
In late April and early May, Trump floated the flawed theory that China continued to allow flights out of Wuhan to Western cities while blocking flights into other cities in China. Specifically, the president claimed China stopped travel from Wuhan to other parts of China even as it allowed flights from Wuhan to Europe and the U.S. But as we wrote, that’s not accurate.
There is no evidence any commercial flights left Wuhan for Western destinations after Jan. 23, other than some repatriation flights chartered by foreign governments, such as U.S. evacuation flights for American citizens, including diplomats and their families.
Niall Ferguson, a Harvard professor who first raised questions about China’s flights out of Wuhan to international destinations, later updated his column to acknowledge that flight data did not confirm that China continued to allow commercial flights to various international destinations, including the U.S., after Jan. 23. And further research by Ferguson concluded that while a half dozen flights left Wuhan for destinations in Asia outside China, “only crew members appear to have been aboard these flights … confirm[ing] that the authorities did prevent Chinese citizens from flying from Wuhan to foreign destinations after January 23.”
In addition to locking down Wuhan, China at the same time enacted “stringent social distancing measures and mobility restrictions” in most of China’s largest cities, according to the research published in the Lancet. Schools were closed, and “only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down.”
By contrast, Trump issued “Coronavirus Guidelines for America” for the following 15 days on March 16 (nearly two months after China’s announced measures), in which he urged “all Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.” Those guidelines — which were later extended to April 30 — were not orders. Numerous states, however, did issue mandatory orders, including school and non-essential business closures. Constitutional experts told us states, not the president, have the authority for such stay-at-home orders.
In an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was recommending that Americans wear a cloth or fabric mask to limit the spread of the virus. Trump stressed that the CDC recommendation was “a voluntary thing.”
“You can do it. You don’t have to do it,” Trump said. “I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.”
The CDC said the recommendation came as new studies showed “a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.”
“A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others,” the updated CDC website now reads. “This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms.”
As we said earlier, China instituted mandatory mask-wearing in public in late January. It also enacted stringent stay-at-home orders.
Research from Columbia University epidemiologists posted in late May concluded that the U.S.’s delay in implementing social distancing cost lives. According to their estimates, if social distancing measures had been implemented just a week prior than they were in mid-March about 36,000 fewer people would have died; and if such measures had been implemented two weeks prior, about 54,000 fewer people would have died.
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health who led the study, told us Trump’s comments about China stopping the virus cold in its own country while allowing it to “go out to the world” are “absurd and highlight our own inability to control the virus.”
“If we believe the case and death numbers coming from China, then the differences are due to the effectiveness of the control that China imposed,” Shaman said in an email. “China is an authoritarian regime, they shut down travel on January 23rd to and from Wuhan and ultimately put 750M citizens around the country under enforced shelter-in-place. This disrupted transmission and drove the reproductive number and incidence down.
“The government built apps that Chinese citizens must use to gain access (by QR scan) to common locations (buses, shops, etc.)—individuals have to scan everywhere they go now, and the scan then reads out a color indicating whether the individual can enter,” he added. “They perform screening and temperature checks at a very high rate, quarantine incoming travelers, isolate infections, and use the app to identify individuals who may have been exposed to infection and if so quarantine them. They use technology and their authoritarian powers to control the virus. We are doing neither.”
A recent study – which has been accepted for publication in Nature – on the effectiveness of pandemic control policies enacted by various countries concluded that non-pharmaceutical interventions greatly reduced the number of infections. For China, the research group estimated there would be about 465 times the number of confirmed cases if “large-scale anti-contagion polices had not been deployed.” For the U.S., the estimate was that confirmed cases would have been 14 times greater if not for its policy interventions.
 “Consistent with process-based simulations of COVID-19 infections, our analysis of existing policies indicates that seemingly small delays in policy deployment likely produced dramatically different health outcomes,” the authors wrote.
Again, much has yet to be learned about China’s response to the coronavirus and what it communicated to world health officials. But, contrary to Trump’s claim, the virus did spread outside Wuhan to other parts of China, according to figures provided by Chinese authorities (and which some experts believe to be undercounts).
That the virus did not spread as widely in China as it did in other countries, including the U.S., is largely the result of extreme measures taken by the Chinese government to control its spread, experts said. Europe and the U.S., experts said, did not implement measures as stringent as China did, and the ones they did implement were not enacted as early.",Robert Farley,2020-06-09 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Schools were closed, and “only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down.”

103,Trump’s Spin on ‘Broken’ Testing,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-spin-on-broken-testing/,,"While his administration has faced criticism for being slow to ramp up testing for coronavirus infections, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the problem was with his predecessors, saying the administration “inherited a broken system” that it “rebuilt.” That’s misleading.
The president has a point that the testing system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alone couldn’t conduct the kind of wide-scale testing the coronavirus pandemic demanded, as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said.
But several former officials have reiterated Fauci’s comments, explaining that the CDC simply isn’t set up to be a commercial test lab, let alone the only test lab for the country in a pandemic like this. And it was a month after the administration declared a public health emergency that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. 
“The CDC designed a good system.” Fauci said on March 13. “If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector.”
Another problem, which we’ve outlined before, was a manufacturing issue with the CDC’s test kits, which it had sent to state and local public health labs in early February.
The CDC didn’t provide a fix for the manufacturing issue for more than two weeks after it revealed the problem. The Food and Drug Administration then, on Feb. 29, said it would allow labs to create and use their own in-house tests immediately, and about a week later, private diagnostic companies began to step in with their own tests.
Weeks prior, two former Trump administration officials, in a Jan. 28 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, had recommended working with the private sector to meet the anticipated testing needs, saying past experience showed the CDC wouldn’t be able to handle the volume of testing.
“If the number of cases increases, experience from the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2015 Zika epidemic suggests that the CDC will struggle to keep up with the volume of screening. Government should focus on working with private industry to develop easy-to-use, rapid diagnostic tests that can be made available to providers,” wrote Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, and Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the FDA.
Dr. Pierre E. Rollin, who worked for the CDC for 27 years, retiring in 2019 as head of an epidemiology team for the Viral Special Pathogens branch, told us the U.S. government, and the CDC in particular, “never had the capability” to produce large quantities of tests. It hasn’t been the case, Rollin said, that one institution “governmental or nongovernmental” would produce test kits for the entire population.
Rollin pointed to flu testing as an example: Those are commercial tests, with the CDC playing a role in checking different commercial tests and helping labs verify they’re getting good results.
“I don’t think it would be reasonable for a government institution to decide to compete with private industry. That doesn’t make sense,” said Rollin, who wrote a March 26 opinion piece for STAT, saying it “shouldn’t come as a surprise” that the CDC wasn’t able to respond quickly to a pandemic like this but questioning why the CDC “seems to be sitting on the sidelines for this pandemic” now. 
Borio also told NPR in a late March interview that “traditionally, our nation has relied on the CDC to get the initial testing out to public health labs. So they’re the first to launch, and they have done so with tremendous success over prior epidemics. But we have to remember that they’re not a manufacturing facility; they are a research and reference lab,” she said. “And in this instance, they encountered some serious technical challenges which really exposed a significant vulnerability in our national capability to roll out tests quickly.”
Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the CDC during the Obama administration, from 2009 to 2017, similarly told USA Today that Trump’s claim about a “broken” testing system is “just wrong. They inherited the system that has worked in every prior emergency. Now, it’s fair to say this is an emergency like no other. But CDC tests were never supposed to meet the entire need for the United States.”
Frieden said in a March 31 opinion piece for USA Today that in addition to the CDC’s flawed test kit being a problem, the FDA “was slow to allow hospital labs to develop their own tests” and the Department of Health and Human Services was also late in working with the private sector to develop widely distributed tests.
Trump, however, has blamed “a testing situation that just wasn’t right,” as he said in the March 29 coronavirus task force briefing. “It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation.”
Former and current officials have explained that having the CDC distribute tests was only good for a relatively small situation, but that doesn’t mean the system was “obsolete” or “broken.”
The following day, the president repeated the assertion, saying in the task force briefing that “this administration inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. It was okay for a tiny, small group of people, but once you got beyond that, it didn’t work.” He added, “We have built an incredible system.”
And Trump said in a March 30 “Fox & Friends” interview: “We inherited a broken test. The whole thing was broken and we rebuilt it.” (There was, of course, no inherited “test” for the new coronavirus, but the president appears to have misspoke in that instance. He went on to talk about the amount of testing being done now in the United States.)
We asked the White House for an explanation of the president’s repeated comments, but we haven’t received a response.
Here we provide a timeline of the testing issues and the administration’s statements and response.
Jan. 18: The CDC test was operational, as a subsequent CDC report suggests.
Jan. 20: The CDC used its own kit to confirm the first case of COVID-19 in the U.S.
Jan. 24: The CDC confirms the second case in the U.S. “Currently, testing must take place at CDC, but CDC is preparing to share these test kits with domestic and international partners,” the agency said.
Jan. 31: The Department of Health and Human Services declares a public health emergency for the U.S.
Feb. 5: The CDC ships test kits to state and local public health labs, as well as international labs.
Feb. 12: The CDC reveals that some labs were having problems when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked. It was a manufacturing problem with one component of the test, CDC later says.
Feb. 25: Only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing — in addition to the CDC processing tests itself. “Commercial labs will also be coming online soon with their own tests,” a CDC official tells reporters.
Feb. 28: The CDC says it had a fix for the manufacturing problem and had manufactured new tests.
Feb. 29: The FDA says labs can create and use their own in-house tests as long as they complete an emergency use authorization request within 15 days.
March 4: Trump falsely claims that he had to end an Obama-era FDA “rule” to more quickly provide diagnostic tests to the public. Experts later told us no such formal regulation was ever implemented under President Barack Obama. Trump may have been referring to the Feb. 29 FDA announcement, allowing labs to use their own tests before getting an emergency use authorization approved by the FDA. But that announcement allowed an exception to a de facto FDA policy; there was no “rule” that needed to be overturned.


March 5: LabCorp says its test is available for health care providers to order. Quest Diagnostics says it will provide testing four days later.
March 6: The U.S. had conducted 1,326 tests, according to data collected by The COVID Tracking Project, including tests with results pending. The group, run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, says it attempts to provide “the number of people being tested, not specimens submitted,” but it also notes state public health authorities, the source of the bulk of the data, are inconsistent in the way they report their information and the quality of their data varies.
March 12: In a congressional hearing, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asks who was in charge of “making sure … as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible.” Fauci answers: “The system — the system does not — is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. … The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.”
March 13: Trump declares a national emergency. The administration holds a coronavirus task force briefing in which Trump announces a “new partnership” with the private sector. “Ten days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on a solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests,” he says.
At the same briefing, Fauci says: “The system was not designed — for what it was designed for it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you’re seeing, because you can’t do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need. Now, looking forward, the system will take care of it.”
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, credits Trump for asking for “an entire overhaul of the testing approach” and calling on “private sector laboratories” to develop tests. “Following the meeting last week, major commercial laboratory equipment and diagnostic companies took immediate action to adopt and develop new testing systems,” she says.
Trump and Birx suggest Google was developing a screening website that large numbers of Americans could use to see if they should be tested and where they could go to get a test. But it turns out the website is a project of a sister company to Google and limited to the San Francisco Bay Area.
March 16: Roche announces that it will have completed shipping the first 400,000 of its high-volume tests to hospitals and reference labs by the end of the week.
March 16: A total of 41,814 tests had been conducted in the U.S., according to The COVID Tracking Project.
March 21: The FDA announces it has given emergency use authorization to a 45-minute test developed by Cepheid for point-of-care use in hospitals to help manage patients and health care workers. Cepheid plans to start shipping tests by the end of March.
March 24: Trump and other administration officials tout a milestone in testing, saying by that day the U.S. will have done “more testing” in eight days than South Korea had done “in eight weeks.” But on a per-capita basis, the U.S. still lags behind South Korea, and other countries, as we explain.
Trump says, without evidence, that the U.S. test “is considered the best test.” One expert told us there’s “no reason to believe US tests are any better (or worse)” than those being run in other countries.
March 27: Abbott labs announces that it has received emergency use authorization from the FDA for its point-of-care test, which provides results within 13 minutes. Unlike the LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics tests, specimens don’t need to be mailed in to be tested — a process that can take several days — and instead can be run on a toaster-sized machine in urgent care clinics or doctors’ offices.
March 31: The U.S. had conducted 1.1 million tests, according to The COVID Tracking Project.
March 31: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio tells CNN the state isn’t “quite sure” when it will see a peak in cases but expects it will be “between mid-April and mid-May.” DeWine says: “Part of this is driven by the fact that we don’t have, you know, widespread testing. That is not unique to Ohio.”
Correction, April 2: We originally wrote that it was more than a month after HHS declared a public health emergency that the administration took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, including by the private sector. It was one month before the FDA allowed labs to use their own in-house tests, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. We have corrected the story.",Lori Robertson,2020-04-01 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation.”
Former and current officials have explained that having the CDC distribute tests was only good for a relatively small situation, but that doesn’t mean the system was “obsolete” or “broken.”
The following day, the president repeated the assertion, saying in the task force briefing that “this administration inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. The group, run by journalists, researchers, scientists and others, says it attempts to provide “the number of people being tested, not specimens submitted,” but it also notes state public health authorities, the source of the bulk of the data, are inconsistent in the way they report their information and the quality of their data varies. It was okay for a tiny, small group of people, but once you got beyond that, it didn’t work.” He added, “We have built an incredible system.”
And Trump said in a March 30 “Fox & Friends” interview: “We inherited a broken test. “And in this instance, they encountered some serious technical challenges which really exposed a significant vulnerability in our national capability to roll out tests quickly.”
Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the CDC during the Obama administration, from 2009 to 2017, similarly told USA Today that Trump’s claim about a “broken” testing system is “just wrong. Now, looking forward, the system will take care of it.”
Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, credits Trump for asking for “an entire overhaul of the testing approach” and calling on “private sector laboratories” to develop tests."
104,Viral Posts Lift Bogus ‘Quarantine’ Story from Satire Site,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-viral-posts-lift-bogus-quarantine-story-from-satire-site/,,"
A satire site a month ago published a joke about the Biden administration creating “quarantine camps” for the unvaccinated. Now that fabricated story is circulating online, presented as if it’s real.
A spoof story has been circulating on social media, presented as though it’s real, spreading the false claim that unvaccinated Americans will be sent to “quarantine camps.”
It’s completely made up.
The story originated on a website called The Stonk Market, which includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says, “TheStonkMarket.com is a financial satire site.”
The original story was posted on June 17 with this headline: “President Joe Biden Announces Americans Not Vaccinated Before 2022 Will Be Put In Camps.”
Less than a week later, two other sites had copied it. They both included a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the story. But social media users missed the note and left comments like this one on Facebook: “Oh he really wants a civil war…doesn’t he???!!!”
Actor Noel Gugliemi, known for his role in “The Fast and the Furious” movies, shared a screenshot of the headline from one of the copycat sites with his 276,000 Instagram followers. He didn’t include a satire disclaimer at all and, instead, posted a comment that claimed, “Either put the poison in you or will try forcing the poison in you, either way you’ll get it or else.”
The same screenshot was then featured in a TikTok video that’s been viewed more than 939,000 times. That video then migrated to another Instagram account, where it’s been viewed more than 38,000 times.
Not only is the claim about “quarantine camps” completely fabricated, but Biden has said that he doesn’t think vaccines should be federally mandated.
As we’ve explained before, as far back as Dec. 4 — before he had taken office and before the first vaccines were available — Biden was asked about potential vaccine mandates. He answered, “No, I don’t think it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like I don’t think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide, I’ll do everything in my power as president of [the] United States to encourage people to do the right thing.”
His administration has maintained that posture since he took office.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki answered a question about the cruise industry and vaccine passports at a May 24 press conference by saying, “[W]e are not instituting vaccine passports from a federal level. We certainly understand that industries will make their own decisions about how to continue their — the work they need to do.”
Then, at a July 12 press briefing, Psaki reaffirmed that the federal government wouldn’t mandate vaccinations, although she said the administration would support entities that do require the shots.
“That’s not a decision that we are making. That’s not a — that is not our intention from the federal government,” Psaki said, responding to a question about local mandates. “There will be decisions made by private-sector entities, by universities, by educational institutions, and even perhaps by local leaders, should they decide that is how to keep their community safe. If they decide to make that decision, we certainly support them in that step.”
The administration has encouraged people to get vaccinated, though, consistently highlighting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
And Biden recently emphasized the importance of vaccination since the more easily transmissible delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 has become the dominant variant in the U.S.
“[M]illions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected,” Biden said on July 6. “And because of that, their communities are at risk. Their friends are at risk. The people they care about are at risk. This is an even bigger concern because of the delta variant.”
He announced a shift in the focus of the vaccination program from large-scale facilities to, instead, “meet people where they are.” The administration is going to focus on supplying vaccines to local pharmacists and physicians and to invest in mobile vaccination clinics that can go to sporting events, places of worship, summer festivals — “wherever we can find people gathered,” Biden said.
“Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,” Biden said.
The phrase about going “door to door” whipped up controversy among some conservative politicians and media personalities, who cast it as something akin to a mandate or forced vaccination scheme. For example, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, of Colorado, referred to the people knocking on doors as “Needle Nazis,” and Fox News host Tucker Carlson said, “I honestly think it’s the greatest scandal in my lifetime by far. … The idea that you would force people to take medicine they don’t want or need, is there a precedent for that in our lifetimes?”
But, as we’ve explained, there’s no evidence to support the claim that the outreach effort would result in forced vaccinations.
And, contrary to Carlson’s claim that vaccines aren’t needed, the seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from COVID-19 has declined by more than 90% since the vaccines became available in the U.S. The seven-day average of daily deaths was 2,781 on Dec. 14; as of July 20, it was down to 237, according to the CDC.
Psaki has made it clear that the federal government will not require anyone to be vaccinated against their wishes.
“What we’re doing is local officials are going to areas where there are lower vaccination rates and providing information on where people can get access to a vaccine, where they can go, that it’s free,” Psaki told reporters on Air Force One on July 7. “It’s up to individuals to decide whether they want to get vaccinated or not.”
The outreach effort relies on “trusted messengers” — who are largely doctors and community and faith leaders — going door to door in areas with low vaccination rates to answer questions and talk about the vaccines, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, explained at a July 8 press briefing.

105,Viral Posts Don’t Give Full Picture of Mask Mandates in States,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/viral-posts-dont-give-full-picture-of-mask-mandates-in-states/,,"Quick Take
Viral Facebook posts misleadingly claim that Florida, Georgia, Idaho, South Dakota and Tennessee have become “mask free.” None has a statewide mask mandate — but individual cities and counties in each of those states do have orders requiring face coverings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. 

Full Story
As COVID-19 cases in the U.S. grew to more than 7.4 million — including President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump — and surpassed 209,000 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continued to urge measures to stop the spread of the pandemic, such as frequent hand washing and social distancing. The CDC also recommends that people “wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in [their] household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”
In early October, 33 states, as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had implemented orders requiring face coverings in public, according to information compiled by AARP.
Wearing a face mask, however, has become a polarizing issue in the U.S., with some Americans viewing the masks as a limitation on personal freedom. Viral memes on Facebook now misleadingly claim that in some states there are no requirements at all for wearing face masks.
“FLORIDA, GEORGIA, IDAHO, SOUTH DAKOTA & TENNESSEE ARE NOW MASK FREE!!!”, one post claims, and shows a photo of two women holding up their hands with the “V” for victory sign.
None of those states has a statewide mandate requiring face coverings. But it is inaccurate to characterize them as mask-free. Individual cities and counties in each of the states has orders in place that mandate face coverings.
In Florida, Miami-Dade County, Palm Beach County and Hillsborough County, which constitute about 21% of the state’s population, have mandates on face coverings.
In early July, a public health emergency order requiring face coverings went into effect in Boise, the capital of Idaho. Jefferson and Fremont counties began requiring face masks in August.
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, the most populous city in Georgia, issued an executive order requiring face masks on July 8. Other cities in North Georgia began requiring face coverings in late August.
Knox County, Shelby County, Memphis and Nashville, which account for nearly 40% of Tennessee’s population, have mandates on face coverings. 
On Sept. 10, Brookings City became the first county in South Dakota to require face coverings. 
In addition, the state health departments in Florida, Georgia, Idaho, South Dakota and Tennessee all recommend the use of face coverings in public settings.

106,"COVID-19 Vaccine Data Was Peer-Reviewed, Contrary to Meme’s Claim",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-covid-19-vaccine-data-was-peer-reviewed-contrary-to-memes-claim/,,"Clinical trials for the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. included tens of thousands of participants and have each been the subject of peer-reviewed studies.
But a meme circulating on social media has been spreading a false claim saying the opposite.
The meme includes this heading: “Things NOT being offered to take the Covid jab.” Then it lists: “Peer reviewed clinical studies proving its safety and efficacy” and “Liability when something goes wrong.”
It’s easy enough to show the first claim is false. The New England Journal of Medicine — a peer-reviewed publication — has published studies finding that the vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson are effective and safe. The NEJM is the oldest continuously published general medical journal in the world and is among the most frequently cited journals.
It’s also worth noting that more than 290 million vaccines have been administered across the country so far with only rare documented cases of serious adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis occurring in approximately 2 to 5 patients per million.
There also have been 32 cases of a rare and dangerous blood clotting condition (primarily in women under 50) among the 10 million people who received the J&J vaccine. The CDC has said that its review of those cases “has not established a causal link,” but “recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.” There have been three deaths linked to the condition as of May 7, the CDC said. 
(See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
The Liability Claim
As for the second part of the claim, it’s true that the companies making the vaccines are largely shielded from liability. But that doesn’t mean that there’s no recourse for those who, in rare instances, might be harmed.
The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005, or PREP Act, provides liability protection for companies involved in producing drugs or other products that help respond to a pandemic. That’s what covers the COVID-19 vaccines.
A recent Congressional Research Service report explained, “In the PREP Act, Congress made the judgment that, in the context of a public health emergency, immunizing certain persons and entities from liability was necessary to ensure that potentially life-saving countermeasures will be efficiently developed, deployed, and administered.”
The liability protection is broad, as we’ve explained before, although it doesn’t extend to death or a serious physical injury that results from willful misconduct.
And, importantly, there’s a system called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, or CICP, that provides compensation for those harmed by vaccines, including those for COVID-19, and other products.
CICP gives benefits to individuals, or to estates of individuals, “who sustain a covered serious physical injury as the direct result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures,” including COVID-19 vaccines, according to the program’s website.
Health Resources & Services Administration spokesman David Bowman told us before that people have a year to submit a claim, which is reviewed by medical staff to determine if the individual experienced a covered injury. The decision, he said, is based on “compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence.”
Since its inception in 2010, Bowman said, CICP has paid out a total of $5.7 million for 39 claims.
Most other vaccines — those not related to the pandemic — are covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, or VICP, which has a fund available to those who may have suffered rare vaccine-related injuries.
VICP was created after lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and health care providers in the 1980s threatened to cause vaccine shortages and reduce vaccination rates, according to the HRSA, which administers the program. It began accepting petitions for compensation in 1988 and, since then, has received more than 24,084. Of those, “19,784 petitions have been adjudicated, with 8,028 of those determined to be compensable, while 11,756 were dismissed. Total compensation paid over the life of the program is approximately $4.5 billion,” according to a recent HRSA report.
From 2006 to 2019, more than 4 billion doses of covered vaccines were administered and 5,755 people were awarded compensation, meaning approximately one person was compensated for every 1 million vaccinations, the report said.
“Being awarded compensation for a petition does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the alleged injury,” the report added. “In fact, [a]pproximately 60 percent of all compensation awarded by the VICP comes as result of a negotiated settlement between the parties in which HHS has not concluded, based upon review of the evidence, that the alleged vaccine(s) caused the alleged injury.”",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-05-28 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"A recent Congressional Research Service report explained, “In the PREP Act, Congress made the judgment that, in the context of a public health emergency, immunizing certain persons and entities from liability was necessary to ensure that potentially life-saving countermeasures will be efficiently developed, deployed, and administered.”

107,Trump’s H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic Spin,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-h1n1-swine-flu-pandemic-spin/,,"In tweets and other appearances, President Donald Trump has repeatedly compared his response to the new coronavirus with President Barack Obama’s handling of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. But Trump’s information is frequently incorrect or misleading — and the two viruses are very different.
In a March 4 telephone interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, for example, Trump falsely claimed that the Obama administration “didn’t do anything” about the 2009 pandemic.
Trump, March 4: Well, I just say that it’s, you know, a very, very small number in this country. And we’re going to try and keep it that way as much as possible. I will say, though, the H1N1, that was swine flu, commonly referred to as swine flu. And that went from around April of ’09 to April of ’10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it’s over 13,000. I think you might have said 17. I had heard it was 13, but a lot of — a lot of deaths. And they didn’t do anything about it. Interestingly, with the swine flu, children were — in particular, they were vulnerable, sort of the opposite in that respect. But children were very vulnerable to the swine flu. But they never did close the borders. I don’t think they ever did have the travel ban. And we did. And, again, they lost at least 13,000.
In a March 12 meeting with the prime minister of Ireland, Trump repeated the sentiment. 
“If you go back and look at the swine flu, and what happened with the swine flu, you’ll see how many people died, and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time, as people were dying all over the place,” he said. “We’re doing it the opposite. We’re very much ahead of everything.”
Trump is correct on the number of H1N1 cases and deaths, but it’s misleading to compare those figures to the current outbreak of COVID-19, which has just begun. It’s also not true that the Obama administration did nothing or waited a long time to act on the H1N1 influenza pandemic.
In 2009, a new H1N1 influenza virus cropped up out of season, in late spring. Because of genetic similarities to influenza viruses in pigs, it became known as a “swine flu,” even though there is no evidence the virus spread between pigs or pigs to humans.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were about 60.8 million cases of infection with the novel type of influenza virus in the U.S. between April 2009 and April 2010, with a total of approximately 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths.
While that death toll may sound high, it’s over an entire year and, in fact, ended up being far lower than was initially expected. The strain of influenza also turned out to have a case fatality rate of just 0.02% — well below even many typical seasonal influenzas.
Everything that’s known about the new coronavirus so far suggests that it’s an entirely different beast than its most recent pandemic predecessor. Peter Jay Hotez, a professor and dean of the tropical medicine school at Baylor College of Medicine, told us that the new virus, which is known as SARS-CoV-2, is considerably more transmissible and more lethal than H1N1.
For those reasons, he said, “the urgency to contain this coronavirus is so much greater than the H1N1 2009 one was.”
In the Hannity interview, Trump touted his travel restrictions and noted that Obama “never did close the borders.” Paul A. Offit, chair of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Trump’s travel restrictions bought the U.S. time to react, but he said it didn’t make any sense to impose travel restrictions in 2009 since the H1N1 was first reported in North America and the flu is “hard to stop.” 
“I don’t think it is a fair comparison,” Offit said. “The flu is constantly mutating – it usually happens in pig and humans in southeast Asia – it is really hard to stop that. Unless you ban all travel anywhere in the world to the United States you would have had trouble. That is true with all flu pandemics. I don’t think a travel ban would have ever made a difference.”
Contrary to Trump’s suggestion that the Obama administration did “nothing,” officials declared a public health emergency early in the H1N1 outbreak, secured funding from Congress and ultimately declared a national emergency, as we’ll explain below. 
On top of that, the CDC sequenced the new virus, created testing kits, and the Food and Drug Administration approved multiple vaccines, among other actions.
Rep. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas, praised the CDC at a House hearing in 2016 for quickly developing a vaccine for the swine flu in about six months — in time for the start of the school year in September 2009. “So that’s a 6-month time frame if I’m doing my math correctly that you were able to identify the genetic sequence of the virus, reverse engineer a vaccine, test it, assure its safety and efficacy, and get it to school teachers on the second week of school. That’s pretty impressive,” he said.  
Trump said in a tweet that the Obama administration’s response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic “was a full scale disaster.” While he can have that opinion, there is little to support such a negative view. 
A New York Times article from January 2010 said that while some mistakes were made, a variety of experts thought the administration had generally handled things well.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine told the Times that officials deserved “at least a B-plus,” while Mount Sinai virologist Peter Palese called the overall response “excellent.”
Obama’s Emergency Declarations
In one tweet, Trump quoted Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs as misleadingly claiming that it “took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency” for the H1N1 “swine flu” outbreak that “killed 12,000 Americans.” It’s true that Obama didn’t declare a national emergency for six months, but that ignores several other steps the administration took, including declaring a public health emergency the same month that the novel H1N1 infections were first reported.
At the time of the tweet, Trump had not yet declared a national emergency for COVID-19.
(Dobbs’ actual quote was slightly different. He said on his March 12 show that it “took six months for President Obama to then declare a national emergency, one that ultimately killed more than 12,000 Americans and infected 60 million more.”)
On April 15, 2009, the first infection was identified in California, according to the CDC, and less than two weeks later, on April 26, 2009, the Obama administration declared a public health emergency. The day before, on April 25, the World Health Organization had declared a public health emergency.
Dr. Richard Besser, then-acting director of the CDC, confirmed to the press on the day of the U.S. declaration that there were 20 cases of H1N1 in the U.S., and that “all of the individuals in this country who have been identified as cases have recovered.”
The same day — April 26 — the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu, and two days later, the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease, according to a CDC timeline on the pandemic.
On April 30, 2009, two days after the public health emergency declaration, Obama formally asked Congress for $1.5 billion to fight the outbreak, and later asked for nearly $9 billion, according a September 2009 Congressional Research Service report. On June 26, 2009, Obama signed Congress’ supplemental appropriation bill that included $7.7 billion for the outbreak.
The U.S. public health emergency was renewed twice — on July 24, 2009, and Oct. 1, 2009.
The WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic on June 11, 2009. Obama declared a national emergency related to the pandemic on Oct. 24, 2009. At the time, the CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, had said millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died. Also about 11.3 million doses of H1N1 vaccine had been distributed, he said.
A month later, on Nov. 12, 2009, the CDC published a report that estimated there had been between 14 million and 34 million H1N1 cases between April 17 and Oct. 17, 2009, and 2,500 to 6,000 H1N1-related deaths.
The H1N1 2009 flu pandemic ultimately did kill 12,000 Americans — the figure Dobbs used — according to the midrange estimate from CDC for April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010. The number of cases totaled an estimated 60.8 million people. To be clear, that strain of the flu continues to cause infections and deaths, at least 75,000 deaths from 2009 to 2018, the CDC says.
In the case of that pandemic, the outbreak began in Mexico and spread quickly to the United States. The first cases in Mexico were identified in March and early April 2009, with the Mexican government reporting an outbreak to the Pan American Health Organization on April 12, 2009, according to a CDC report.
In the case of COVID-19, the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, China, and officials reported an outbreak to the WHO on Dec. 31. The CDC announced the first American case on Jan. 21. The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, one day after the WHO did so, and announced a national emergency on March 13. Two days before, the WHO had declared the global outbreak a pandemic. 
Trump Misleads on Polls Again
In yet another tweet, Trump again misleadingly cited poll information to claim he has “78%” approval of his administration’s response to the new coronavirus outbreak.

Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2020

 
He claimed this was “the highest on record,” while Biden’s approval rating for the response to the H1N1 outbreak “was lowest.” Even according to a dated poll, the H1N1 approval wasn’t the lowest.
As we’ve written before when the president cited Gallup, a poll by the company, taken Feb. 3-16 and released Feb. 20, before anyone had died from COVID-19 in this country, found that 77% of Americans were very or somewhat confident that the government would be able to handle an outbreak of new coronavirus. That was a higher percentage than American confidence in previous administrations’ ability to deal with Zika, Ebola, swine flu and bird flu, according to an average of polls. But the confidence in swine flu was the second highest — at 67% — not the “lowest,” as Trump claimed.
And as the number of cases and deaths have grown, public confidence in the Trump administration has decreased, according to several polls. A Quinnipiac poll, taken March 5-8 and released March 9, found 43% of registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling the outbreak response.
With the swine flu, however, at least two polls showed higher approval of the Obama administration (the polls didn’t ask about Biden). A Washington Post-ABC News poll taken in October 2009 found 69% of adults were confident in the federal government’s ability to respond to an outbreak. A CNN poll released in early November 2009 found 57% approved of Obama’s response.
Also, Trump may have given Biden a promotion, claiming he “was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic.” When we asked the Biden campaign about that, we were told that the former vice president “helped lead” the response to the pandemic “but was not the top official for it.”",Jessica McDonald,2020-03-13 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"He said on his March 12 show that it “took six months for President Obama to then declare a national emergency, one that ultimately killed more than 12,000 Americans and infected 60 million more.”)
On April 15, 2009, the first infection was identified in California, according to the CDC, and less than two weeks later, on April 26, 2009, the Obama administration declared a public health emergency. Dr. Richard Besser, then-acting director of the CDC, confirmed to the press on the day of the U.S. declaration that there were 20 cases of H1N1 in the U.S., and that “all of the individuals in this country who have been identified as cases have recovered.”
The same day — April 26 — the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu, and two days later, the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease, according to a CDC timeline on the pandemic. “If you go back and look at the swine flu, and what happened with the swine flu, you’ll see how many people died, and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time, as people were dying all over the place,” he said. On April 30, 2009, two days after the public health emergency declaration, Obama formally asked Congress for $1.5 billion to fight the outbreak, and later asked for nearly $9 billion, according a September 2009 Congressional Research Service report. A month later, on Nov. 12, 2009, the CDC published a report that estimated there had been between 14 million and 34 million H1N1 cases between April 17 and Oct. 17, 2009, and 2,500 to 6,000 H1N1-related deaths."
108,Meme Trumpets Falsehood About Delta Variant,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-meme-trumpets-falsehood-about-delta-variant/,,"The delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads more quickly than the original virus and has been classified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization. It is now the dominant variant in the U.S. But a meme has been circulating on Facebook falsely claiming the delta variant is “fake news.”

The delta variant of the coronavirus, which was first documented in India in October, is now the dominant variant in the U.S. It accounted for more than half of new infections for the two weeks ending July 3, according to the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Viruses change over time and, as they mutate, they produce variants, which can develop more dangerous attributes. Four variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been called “notable” by the CDC, which is monitoring their growth across the country. The delta variant is among them.
This variant of the virus spreads more quickly and easily than the original, and it has been designated as a “variant of concern” by both the World Health Organization and a U.S. government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group.
A variant that spreads more easily could lead to more cases of COVID-19, which could strain the health care system and, potentially, cause more deaths, according to the CDC.
“Where the delta variant is identified, it really rapidly takes off and spreads between people more efficiently than even the alpha variant,” WHO epidemiologist Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explained in a recent interview.
So far, the delta variant has been detected in 98 countries, according to the WHO.
But a meme has been circulating on Facebook suggesting that the variant isn’t real or isn’t serious. It says, “The Delta Variant Is Fake News.”
That text is typed over a 2017 executive order that then-President Donald Trump signed to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. After signing it, Trump held up the order and a photo of that moment has been used to make a host of similar memes.
The meme has garnered comments indicating that many believe the mutations of the virus that causes COVID-19 are political fabrications, as shown in this example: “They’re just getting us ready to lock us down again in 2022 so they can have a cheat fest again.”
But, as we said, the delta variant is a “variant of concern” and is now responsible for more than half of the new COVID-19 infections in the U.S.
It’s worth noting, too, that the currently available vaccines appear to be effective against the delta variant, but it’s important to get the full dosage of the vaccine if two shots are required, as is the case for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Also, the standard public health guidance that recommends physical distancing and wearing masks can help to control the spread of this variant.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-07-09 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"But a meme has been circulating on Facebook falsely claiming the delta variant is “fake news.”

109,Websites and Social Posts Misrepresent CDC Director’s Comments on Breakthrough Deaths,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-websites-and-social-posts-misrepresent-cdc-directors-comments-on-breakthrough-deaths/,,"
In a May 16 interview, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director said the agency knew of 223 breakthrough fatalities among fully vaccinated individuals, but “not all … died of COVID.” That is not an admission that “many, many hospitals” previously “overcounted” COVID-19 deaths, as conservative websites have reported.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tracking hospitalizations and fatalities for so-called “COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases.”
The CDC says a breakthrough case occurs when an individual tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — more than two weeks “after they have completed all recommended doses” of one of three vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the United States.
In a May 16 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky,  said the agency so far was aware of 223 deaths among individuals with breakthrough cases of COVID-19.
However, not all of them died from the disease, she told CNN’s Dana Bash.
Bash, May 16: Are you aware of any fully vaccinated individual who has died of COVID-19?
Walensky: We do keep a track of this on our website.
We are asking hospitals and health care facilities to send us cases of what we’re calling breakthrough infections. They occur. They are rare. We are aware of 223, as of May 10, that are among the 115 million people that had been vaccinated by that time.
I also want to convey that now many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in, so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID. They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack.
Walensky did not provide the exact numbers, but a footnote on the CDC’s webpage at the time said 42 of the 223 fatal cases were “reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.” As of May 17, there were 353 fatal cases and 63 were asymptomatic or not related to the disease.


After the interview, The Gateway Pundit, a conservative news website, falsely claimed that Walensky’s remarks amounted to an admission that the CDC’s overall total for deaths from COVID-19 is inflated.
The headline of its May 17 story was “CDC Director Finally Admits that COVID Cases were Over-Counted in Hospitals – Just as Gateway Pundit and Donald Trump Reported in August.”
“On Sunday CDC Director Rochelle Walensky finally admitted that ‘many, many hospitals’ were counting COVID deaths to include cases that were not COVID deaths,” the website reported.
A day later, the Conservative Daily Post, following the Gateway Pundit’s lead, also said that “[t]he CDC admitted that COVID numbers were hugely exaggerated.”
That’s false.
In late August, both the Gateway Pundit and former President Trump promoted a tweet that inaccurately said: “This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid. That’s 9,210 deaths. The other 94% had 2 to 3 other serious illnesses and the overwhelming majority were of very advanced age.”
But as we later wrote in early September, the fact that the CDC said 6% of the total deaths were solely attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates does not mean the disease was not the leading contributor in the other 94% of the deaths. 
And nothing Walensky said in the CNN interview changes that — or indicates that the Gateway Pundit and Trump were actually “right,” as the Gateway Pundit declared.
We’ve noted several times before that COVID-19 often causes other serious conditions that lead to death, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. It can also exacerbate existing illnesses that people already have, such as diabetes or hypertension, which are called comorbidities.
For our article last year, Jeff Lancashire, a spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us that COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause in 92% of those deaths. That means it was the condition that started the chain of events that resulted in someone dying.  
More recently, the CDC said the disease was listed as the underlying cause of death in at least 90% of 574,054 deaths, as of May 19. “For the remaining deaths, COVID-19 was listed as a contributing cause of death,” the agency said.
Walensky’s remarks about some people dying with the disease instead of from it — which does happen — also led social media users to claim that the CDC has changed the way deaths from COVID-19 are being reported.
For example, one Instagram user wrote: “So for anyone who died of anything last year but happened to have Covid, their death was marked as Covid-19. But now, if anyone dies with Covid after being fully vaccinated… but there are other comorbidities… Covid will not be considered the cause of death. Funny how that works. The CDC is an embarrassment.”
But it is simply not the case that “anyone who died of anything last year but happened to have Covid” was counted as a COVID-19 death. And the CDC denies that it is now reporting fatalities in breakthrough cases differently.
“As for how CDC is counting COVID-19 deaths, there has been no change,” Kristen Nordlund, a CDC spokesperson, told FactCheck.org in an email.
The CDC says it relies on state and territory health departments to report data on people with breakthrough cases, and the data include hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause, including non-COVID-19 causes.


For a fatal case, the agency asks those health departments to provide a copy of the death certificate “linked to the case so that a determination could be made if COVID-19 contributed to the cause of death.”
Those death certificates are also how the CDC determines COVID-19 deaths in non-breakthrough cases. And the CDC has long advised physicians, medical examiners and others who are responsible for filling out the documents not to list COVID-19 if the disease played no part in a death.
“I think there has been consistency all along and nothing that Walensky said suggests that they made a change,” Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told us in a phone interview. 
He said there would be “huge backlash” in the medical field if the CDC now tried to change the way it compiles and collects death certificate data.
It all needs to be done in a consistent way to monitor trends, Plescia said.

110,Constitutional Experts: Trump Lacks Power to ‘Open Up the States’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/constitutional-experts-trump-lacks-power-to-open-up-the-states/,,"Constitutional experts say President Donald Trump is wrong that he, not governors, has the power to “open up the states” where businesses were closed or residents were ordered to stay at home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
On April 10, Trump said he would “love to open” the country by May 1 and that he is creating what he called an “Opening Our Country” task force, which will “play a role” in determining when businesses would be reopened. But, he said, “ultimately, I have to make that decision.”
Several governors, however, said they would be making those kinds of determinations for their states, not the president. For example, on CNN’s “State of the Union” on April 12, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’d make any decision about easing coronavirus-related restrictions in her state.
“We’re going to make the decisions that safeguard New Mexicans,” Lujan Grisham said. “Everything we do is about protecting lives and first responders or health care workers.”
Lujan Grisham said she welcomed “better national strategies,” but, she added, “I’m going to do whatever is right for New Mexico. And we’ve begun looking at recovery options but we aren’t going to do anything until that peak occurs and we’re clear about not having hospitalizations and reducing the number of people that are positive every day in our surveillance and testing efforts.”
Last month, when Trump said he wanted to have the country “open for business” by Easter on April 12, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said his state would not oblige.
“Whatever messages that are coming out of Washington, we are going to make sure we take care of the needs of New Hampshire first,” Sununu, a Republican, said.
Since then, several news reports have concluded that, constitutionally, those decisions would ultimately be made by state governors, not Trump.
Via Twitter on April 13, Trump criticized the “Fake News Media” for “saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect…. It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.”

….It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020

Later in the day, at a press briefing, Trump reiterated that he has the “ultimate authority.”
“I’m going to put it very simply. The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful,” he said. “The president of the United States calls the shots.”
It’s unclear under what authority Trump is making his claim, and the White House did not clarify when we reached out to the press office. But constitutional experts disagree with him.
“The president is *not* correct,” Robert Chesney, a professor of law and associate dean for academic affairs at the University of Texas School of Law, told us via email. (The emphasis is his.)
In a post for the Lawfare blog published on March 24, Chesney noted that the restrictions now in place “flow primarily from rules promulgated by state governors, county commissioners and mayors — not from the federal government.”
“President Trump is wrong as a matter of constitutional law,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law at the University of California, told us via email.
“Quarantine and stay-at-home orders are entirely the decision of the state governors,” he said. “States have the police power and the authority to quarantine. The President has no authority to override such orders and order the country open. No federal statute gives the President such authority. Nor did the President order sheltering in place; he can exhort, but the orders come from state and local governments.”
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who served as an impeachment expert for House Republicans in December, told the New York Times, “There is no authority for a president to order states to ‘open up’ if the state believes that such an order would be inimical to public health. The president had no authority to order a national lockdown and certainly does not have authority to now order the lifting of such orders issued by governors.”
According to the National Governors Association, 41 states have issued mandatory stay-at-home orders (in three other states it is a “guidance”; in one, it is a “recommendation,” and in two other states the stay-at-home orders apply only to specific vulnerable populations); all states have closed schools; 41 states have prohibited in-person workforces at nonessential businesses; and almost every state has limited the operations of restaurants and bars.
When a reporter pointed out at the April 13 press conference that it was the states — not the federal government — that closed schools and ordered the closure of nonessential businesses, Trump responded, “That’s because I let that happen, because I would’ve preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up.”
Writing for Politico, Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, explained that states and local governments are authorized to mandate such restrictions based on broad “police power” authority which “can be traced to English common law and is reserved to the states by the 10th Amendment.”
As a result, Joh wrote, “State and local governments can indeed decide to force even unwilling businesses to shut down, require people to stay mostly at home, impose curfews and even threaten noncompliance with arrest if necessary.”
“The police power of the states has been invoked on multiple occasions by the Supreme Court, often in contrast to the limited powers of the federal government,” Joh wrote, in a March 18 article.
In an interview on CNN on April 13, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association, said that governors would be discussing the wisdom of opening their states with “multiple smart people at the federal level,” such as Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“We’d love to have the president’s cooperation.” Hogan added. “But governors made decisions to take various actions in their states based on what they thought was right for their state, based on the facts on the ground, talking with doctors and scientists and I think individual governors who made those decisions will have the ultimate decision about what to do with their states.”
That doesn’t mean the president can’t influence things.
“The president, of course, is entitled to express his views on this point,” Chesney said in his Lawfare post. That would have “a significant practical effect” on “those who trust him,” and as a result if the president were to speak against things like “shelter-in-place” rules, there’s likely to be a higher rate of noncompliance among “citizens sympathetic to the president,” he said. It also would likely put pressure on Republican leaders at the state and local level to adopt a similar position.
Trump appeared to reference that political power when he said, during a press conference on April 13, that “if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election.”
But if some state and local officials buck the president’s call, Chesney said, “the president cannot simply order state and local officials to change their policies.”
On March 16, Trump issued the 15-day “Coronavirus Guidelines for America,” in which he urged, “all Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.”
On March 29, Trump announced that those guidelines would be extended to April 30.
But those were guidelines, not orders.
During a press briefing on April 10, Trump was asked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis considering opening Florida schools in May. Trump said governors should make those decisions because “from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done.” But Trump maintained that he had the right to overrule DeSantis if he disagreed.
Trump, April 10: I have a lot of confidence in Ron DeSantis, a lot of faith in Ron DeSantis to make the right decision. He’s doing a great job as governor. Ron DeSantis, I had read where he’s thinking about opening up the schools earlier than the date — the end of the month. I’d have to look at the numbers.
But again, you know, I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that’s the way it should be done. If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I’d rather have them — you can call it “federalist,” you can call it “the Constitution,” but I call it “the Constitution.” I would rather have them make their decisions.
But he’s made a lot of good decisions. And he hasn’t said he’s going to, but he’s thinking about it. So I’ll take a look at it.
Chesney says Trump is wrong about that.
Chesney in Lawfare, March 24: Federal law is supreme over state law in our system. And so, if there is an otherwise-constitutional federal law compelling an outcome that runs contrary to a state or local rule, the federal law prevails. But it does not follow that President Trump can therefore override state and local rules on matters like shelter-in-place.
First, no currently existing statute plausibly can be read to confer such an authority on the president. The Stafford Act, the Defense Production Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the various statutes triggered by a declaration under the National Emergencies Act—none of these come close to authorizing something like this.
Second, there is little chance that this Congress is going to pass a statute that even purports to confer authority on the president to override state and local rules. I just do not see the House cooperating in such an effort.
Third, the president cannot plausibly claim inherent Article II authority to accomplish an override.
Article II in the Constitution establishes the powers of the president.
In an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Chemerinsky said “no federal law gives the president power to order businesses to close or, for that matter, to open.”
“Trump on his own lacks the power to act,” Chemerinsky wrote. “The president can exhort state and local governments to lift their restrictions. He can try to persuade businesses to open and defy the closure orders. He can ask Congress to pass legislation. But he cannot override state or local law, and he cannot provide immunity from sanctions to those who violate state and local restrictions. The bottom line is that if California, or other states, or cities or counties, feel the need to continue restrictions … they may do so.”
Six East Coast states and three West Coast states announced that they will work together jointly as regions on their reopening plans.
At his April 13 press briefing, Trump said he would provide the press “a legal brief if you want” on his “ultimate authority,” but none was immediately forthcoming. We followed up with the White House press office, but we got no response.


Presidential Emergency Action Documents
In an April 10 opinion piece published in the New York Times, Elizabeth Goitein and Andrew Boyle of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law discussed classified documents known as Presidential Emergency Action Documents.
“These documents consist of draft proclamations, executive orders and proposals for legislation that can be quickly deployed to assert broad presidential authority in a range of worst-case scenarios,” Goitein and Boyle wrote. “They are one of the government’s best-kept secrets. No presidential emergency action document has ever been released or even leaked. And it appears that none has ever been invoked.”
The Presidential Emergency Action Documents, or PEAD, were first created during the Eisenhower administration in the event of a nuclear war, they wrote. Since then, those plans have expanded to include responses to other national emergencies, including pandemics. They cited one 2004 declassified government memo that said, “PEADs are used to implement extraordinary Presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations.” But the details of these documents have not been revealed publicly, even to members of Congress.
Asked about the comments by Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the April 13 press conference, Boyle told us it is “certainly possible” they were referring to those Presidential Emergency Action Documents.
For example, Trump said, “This is when somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be.” And, “The authority of the president of the United States having to do with the subject we’re talking about is total.”
Pence said he agreed: “Well, make no mistake about it. In the long history of this country, the authority of the president of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. You can look back through times of war and other national emergencies.”
If the president and vice president are referring to Presidential Emergency Action Documents, Boyle told us in a phone interview it is “highly questionable that these documents are consistent with constitutional law.” Boyle, counsel for the Brennan Center’s Liberty & National Security program, agrees with constitutional scholars who say, “this is a power given to the states, not to the federal government.”
Nor does Boyle think the coronavirus pandemic meets the emergency threshold needed to trigger an attempt at such expanded executive powers. Unlike in a nuclear attack, he said, Congress and the courts are still functioning. “There really is no legitimate claim in these circumstances,” he said.
Chesney, director of the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin, told us the classified memos only amount to a legal opinion from lawyers at the Department of Justice, and that doesn’t make them legal.
“The executive branch has anticipated various nightmare scenarios, and — mindful that there wouldn’t be time for the usual drafting-and-vetting process in the teeth of catastrophe — someone pre-wrote a bunch of orders that a president in such a situation might want to issue,” Chesney told us via email. “We can assume there is some wild stuff in them, stuff that might be of very questionable legality in general, maybe even stuff that would be dubious even in the worst of circumstances.
“But the fact that someone has pre-written such documents does *nothing* to make the actions they describe more or less legal,” Chesney added. “At most, it means that someone at DOJ at some point reviewed the document and decided that, in the right (worst) fact patterns, the thing described in the document could be legal. That doesn’t actually make it legal, and it definitely doesn’t mean that today’s facts even match up with whatever scenario the document author had in mind.”
“So, let’s assume there is some pre-written emergency memo that purports to assert presidential authority over huge swaths of the economy, and Trump breaks the glass, signs it, and starts ordering various sectors to reopen despite state law to the contrary,” Chesney continued. “Does the president’s order control? The answer would be the same with or without the pre-written memo. (I think the answer would be no, incidentally).”
Boyle agrees, but says given the possibility that Trump could invoke the documents, “Congress should insist on having full access to them to ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution and basic principles of democracy.”
It is also possible, Boyle said, the Trump administration, including those who have long held a “robust view” of executive power, would argue that with or without the memos, the president’s powers in certain circumstances are absolute.
If the administration has a legal argument for that, Boyle said, he’d like to see it. (Both Trump and Pence said the administration could provide such legal briefs.)
“Show us your work,” Boyle said. “Then we can have that debate.”",Robert Farley,2020-04-14 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Trump appeared to reference that political power when he said, during a press conference on April 13, that “if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election.”

“So, let’s assume there is some pre-written emergency memo that purports to assert presidential authority over huge swaths of the economy, and Trump breaks the glass, signs it, and starts ordering various sectors to reopen despite state law to the contrary,” Chesney continued. You can look back through times of war and other national emergencies.”
If the president and vice president are referring to Presidential Emergency Action Documents, Boyle told us in a phone interview it is “highly questionable that these documents are consistent with constitutional law.” Boyle, counsel for the Brennan Center’s Liberty & National Security program, agrees with constitutional scholars who say, “this is a power given to the states, not to the federal government.”
Nor does Boyle think the coronavirus pandemic meets the emergency threshold needed to trigger an attempt at such expanded executive powers."
111,Charlie Kirk Misleads on White House Vaccine Policy,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-charlie-kirk-misleads-on-white-house-vaccine-policy/,,"
Update, Sept. 10: On Sept. 9, Biden announced a federal mandate for COVID-19 vaccines that applies to employees of the executive branch — including White House staff — and all federal agencies and members of the armed services. The mandate does not apply to those who work for Congress or the federal court system. 
On July 29, President Joe Biden announced that federal employees and onsite contractors will be asked to attest to their vaccination status — and indicated that those who don’t attest to being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be required to comply with other mitigation measures, including routine testing, masking, physical distancing and travel restrictions.

But in a highly viewed video on Facebook and Instagram, a conservative personality railing against vaccine mandates is simply claiming that White House employees are “not required to be vaccinated.”
“It should be the No. 1 news story in the country,” Charlie Kirk claims in his Aug. 20 video, which has accrued more than 2 million views. “Did you know that in the White House they are not mandating the vaccine? Did you know that White House staff is not required to get vaccinated?”
He later asks whether some undisclosed safety concerns are behind the purported decision to not require the vaccines: “Do they know something about the vaccine? Why aren’t they mandating it? Are they seeing data that is questionable? Should we be worried because they know something we don’t?”
Kirk plays footage in which a reporter asks White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki whether a vaccine mandate for White House staff exists, and Psaki responds, “No, we have not mandated it.”
While there is still not a full-blown vaccine mandate for White House staffers, that exchange is from July 23 — six days before the White House announcement of the so-called “vaccine-or-test” requirement for all federal employees. A White House official confirmed to us that the policy applies to White House staff.
Kirk did not respond to our requests for comment.

The process of actually implementing the federal policy is ongoing among agencies. The Department of Justice, for example, released an Aug. 13 memo that said an electronic form for employees to indicate their vaccination status would “be available soon” and said it was developing a program to facilitate testing.
We asked the White House for more specifics on the policy rollout for its staff — and what percentage of its workers has so far attested to being fully vaccinated — but it didn’t provide us with answers.
On Aug. 23 — following the Food and Drug Administration’s full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those 16 and older — Biden urged business leaders and others to implement a similar policy.
“If you’re a business leader, a non-profit leader, a state or local leader who has been waiting for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I call on you now to do that — require it,” Biden said. “Do what I did last month and require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.”
A reporter asked Psaki the same day whether a more strict mandate would be implemented for federal employees.
“I think you’re looking more at agency to agency or different factions of the government at this point, but expect there will be more on that front,” Psaki said.
In terms of the attestation policy, the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force instructs agencies to “ask employees to complete the Certification of Vaccination form” to “provide information about their vaccination status and attest to the truthfulness of that information. Individuals who do not complete the form will be treated as not fully vaccinated for purposes of agency safety protocols.”
Employees who make a false statement on the form risk being fired and are also committing a federal crime, according to the task force.
The task force also directs agencies to “establish a screening testing program for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to test Federal employees and contractor employees who work onsite and who are not fully vaccinated or who have declined to provide their vaccination information. Enrollment in this testing program is mandatory for those individuals and they must be tested at least once a week.”
Employees who refuse to take a test may face “disciplinary measures,” it adds, and could be barred from “the agency workplace for the safety of others pending resolution of any disciplinary or other action the agency may pursue.”",Angelo Fichera,2021-08-24 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Should we be worried because they know something we don’t?”

112,"Nuremberg Code Addresses Experimentation, Not Vaccines",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/nuremberg-code-addresses-experimentation-not-vaccines/,,"Quick Take
A bogus claim that “[v]accines are in direct violation of The Nuremberg Code” has been circulating on social media. Actually, the Nuremberg Code addresses the treatment of human subjects in medical experiments and says nothing about the use of tested and authorized vaccines on patients.
Full Story
The code of medical ethics created in response to Nazi experiments during the Holocaust has been misrepresented by those pushing an anti-vaccine message during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This is just the latest example of a falsehood aimed at discrediting vaccines during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. Since April, we’ve debunked at least three other claims aimed at the same thing.
Now, Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories and the anti-vaccine movement are posting claims that say, in part: “Vaccines are in direct violation of The Nuremberg Code.”
That’s not true.
The Nuremberg Code was written in 1947 during the trial in Nuremberg, Germany, of doctors who conducted medical experiments on more than 7,000 concentration camp prisoners during World War II. They tested ways to improve the chances of survival for Nazi soldiers in the field. They tested medical procedures and drugs. They conducted experiments to support their ideological view of racial superiority.
All of these experiments were done without the consent of the subjects.
That’s what the Nuremberg Code addressed — the treatment of human subjects in medical experiments.
“It’s about human experiments,” Jonathan Moreno, a medical ethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said of the Nuremberg Code in an email to FactCheck.org, emphasizing that the claim is false.
The code says nothing about the use of tested and authorized vaccines or treatments on patients.
“The purpose of the code was to say that what the Nazi doctors did would never happen again,” George Annas, director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at Boston University School of Public Health, said in an interview with FactCheck.org.
Both Moreno and Annas said that the code could not be interpreted to bar vaccination.
The basis for this claim goes back much further than the pandemic, though. As is often the case with false claims like this, it appears to have evolved from a more vague suggestion made years ago.
In the 1990s, a prominent vaccine critic, Barbara Loe Fisher, cited one of the core principles stated in the Nuremberg Code — informed consent — to support her argument that parents should have more freedom to choose whether or not to vaccinate their children. All 50 states require children to be vaccinated in order to start school, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. All 50 states also have medical exemptions, while 45 states and the District of Columbia offer religious exemptions.
But Loe Fisher appears to have mixed up two different lineages of informed consent — the one that applies to subjects of medical experimentation (as in the case of the Nuremberg Code) and the one that applies to patients in a regular health care setting (as in the case of vaccines).
In a television appearance in 1997, Loe Fisher said: “Informed consent has been the gold standard in medical practice ever since the Nuremberg Codes were passed after World War II. There should be no exception for vaccination.”
The website for her organization — the National Vaccine Information Center, which we’ve written about before — has a post that acknowledges that the code “speaks most specifically to the use of human beings in medical research.” But it goes on to claim that the code “has been viewed by bioethicists and U.S. courts as the basis for the right to informed consent to medical procedures carrying a risk of injury or death.”
That’s not true.
The Nuremberg Code has “only been used by courts in the human experimentation context,” Annas told us. And the principle of informed consent in the regular doctor-patient relationship, outside of medical experimentation, doesn’t come from the Nuremberg Code, he said. That developed separately.
The concept of informed consent in medical research grew largely out of unethical research projects conducted in the early 20th century, including the experiments during the Holocaust and the syphilis study done on black men without their consent in Tuskegee, Alabama, according to a paper from the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, which distinguishes between the idea of informed consent for medical research and regular treatment.
The concept of informed consent in the health care setting, however, “developed from the intentional tort of battery, which protects individuals from an unwanted physical touching of the body by others having neither express nor implied consent of the person touched,” according to a paper published in the Mayo Clinic’s peer-reviewed journal.
In support of the bogus claim that the Nuremberg Code would apply to the use of vaccines, the National Vaccine Information Center’s post includes out-of-context quotes from two bioethicists.
One of them, Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at New York University, told us in an email that the use of a quote from his 1992 article is “[c]ompletely erroneous” and is a “[f]lat out Reflection of both ignorance of history and ethics.”
It is “a gross disservice to the victims of brutal Nazi experiments to distort my words for lame anti-science that will kill people if this bilge is taken seriously,” Caplan said.
Jay Katz, the other professor whose work was cited by the National Vaccine Information Center, died in 2008. But his article was about the informed consent of human subjects in medical research. It had nothing to do with vaccines or informed consent among ordinary patients.
We asked the National Vaccine Information Center about the claims in its post, but it responded with the same information given on its website.
Despite the dubious claims it makes, the National Vaccine Information Center’s post is still being shared on social media and has been used to support other, related falsehoods about vaccines over the years.
As we’ve explained, the Nuremberg Code says nothing about the use of already tested and authorized medicine or prevention, like vaccines. The full text is below:
1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.
The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.
2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.
3. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.
4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.
5. No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.
6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.
7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.
8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.
9. During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.
10. During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.
Update, May 17: After this story was written, the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to three COVID-19 vaccines – a review process that is typically less stringent than full licensure. We changed the wording in this story to refer to vaccines as authorized, not approved, to avoid confusion. We thank the reader who brought this to our attention.

113,Trump Misrepresents Google Coronavirus Website,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-misrepresents-google-coronavirus-website/,,"President Donald Trump and other officials misleadingly suggested that tech behemoth Google was working on a screening website that large numbers of Americans could soon use to see if they should be tested for the new coronavirus. The website, however, is actually a project of Google’s sister company Verily and is initially limited to the San Francisco Bay Area.
Trump first mentioned the project in a March 13 press conference in the Rose Garden.
Trump, March 13: I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.
We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the — this country in large part. So the world, by the way — we’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country. Stores in virtually every location.
Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this.
Trump never explicitly said the website would soon be available to all Americans, but he strongly implied as much by touting the speed of development, noting the numerous testing locations covering “this country in large part,” and by mentioning Google’s engineers and the “overriding goal” to “help all Americans” in the same breath.
A bit later in the press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx also indicated that the website was part of a larger effort when she unveiled a flow chart and spoke about a “new approach to testing” involving the alleged Google website. 
Birx, March 13: So we want to also announce this new approach to testing, which will start in the screening website up here, facilitated by Google, where clients and patients and people that have interest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire — move down for symptoms or risk factors, yes. They would move down this and be told where the drive-thru options would be for them to receive this test. The labs will then move to the high-throughput automated machines to be able to provide results in 24 to 36 hours.
Less than an hour after the press conference, Google tweeted a clarifying statement from Verily, the Google-adjacent company responsible for the screening website.
“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing,” the company said, referring to the name of the disease caused by the new virus. “Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.”
It should be noted that while Verily is linked to Google, it is not the same entity. Verily is a life sciences and health care subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Reuters reported that some Google employees are assisting Verily, but the company did not share any numbers. The 1,700 engineers Trump cited is likely incorrect, as per the New York Times, that figure is the number of employees who said the day before that they would be willing to volunteer for the project.
In a series of tweets the next day, Google said it was “fully aligned” with the U.S. government on limiting the spread of the coronavirus, and announced that it was partnering with the government to develop a nationwide website “that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information.” 
But such a site bears no resemblance to what Trump and Birx previously announced. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai gave more details in a March 15 blog post, saying the website would be “dedicated to COVID-19 education, prevention, and local resources nationwide” and would include “best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses.”
And indeed, the Verily project “to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area” was described separately.
Trump, however, pointed to those tweets as vindication. In an evening press briefing on March 15, Trump held up a printout of those tweets and let it drop to the ground while criticizing the press and claiming he was supported by Google’s statements.
Trump, March 15: I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, said — called us and he apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know — this is from Google — they put out a release. And you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out — and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.
A few hours earlier, Trump had retweeted the Google thread and falsely said the news media “never called Google.”
Contrary to Trump’s claims, none of Google’s statements support anything other than the idea that Verily was working on a screening survey that would at first be limited to the Bay Area — a fact that Trump never acknowledged in any of the briefings, although Vice President Mike Pence allowed as much in a March 14 briefing. 
In a March 15 blog post, Verily said it would have a Bay Area rollout for its triage tool on March 16, but didn’t mention plans to expand outside of California. “Ultimately, our goal is to help local authorities expand testing access in California as the need continues to increase,” the post reads. “The program is in its early stages, and we will take the time to assess operations at pilot sites in the Bay Area before rolling out to additional sites.”
That’s not to say that a national rollout isn’t possible — in statements to other journalists, Verily spokespeople have vaguely said that the company hopes to broaden the effort. But the company has remained noncommittal and has not released a timetable. 
We reached out to Google, Verily and Verily’s Project Baseline, which is in charge of the project, and did not receive replies.
As of March 16, the online screener is available to Californians in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties only.
Trump is also wrong to say that journalists “never called Google.” Many, in fact, did, which is why numerous news articles include statements and other comments from Verily. 
The New York Times said that Google officials directed its questions about the project to Verily, “where a spokeswoman said the company was merely ‘in the early stages of development.’” TechCrunch said that it contacted Google “a few minutes” after Trump’s comments, and it took Verily nearly two hours to respond. Reuters quoted two Verily spokeswomen. And the Verge reported that the communications lead for Verily said the triage website was initially meant for health care workers, not the general public. “Now that it has been announced the way it was, however,” the Verge article notes, “anybody will be able to visit it, she said.”",Jessica McDonald,2020-03-16 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai gave more details in a March 15 blog post, saying the website would be “dedicated to COVID-19 education, prevention, and local resources nationwide” and would include “best practices on prevention, links to authoritative information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and helpful tips and tools from Google for individuals, teachers and businesses.”

114,Doctors in Video Falsely Equate COVID-19 With a ‘Normal Flu Virus’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/doctors-in-video-falsely-equate-covid-19-with-a-normal-flu-virus/,,"Quick Take
A video posted by a European-based group called World Doctors Alliance falsely claims the novel coronavirus is “a normal flu virus” and there is no COVID-19 pandemic. Actually, COVID-19 is deadlier than the seasonal flu, and some European nations are combatting a second wave of cases.

Full Story
According to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we remain in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, with an uptick in case numbers and hospitalizations straining the ability of medical centers in some areas to cope. Some European governments have imposed more restrictions to fight another wave of cases.
Yet on Oct. 10, Heiko Schöning, a German physician and head of a group known by the German acronym ACU2020, announced formation of an organization called World Doctors Alliance to challenge the veracity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alliance website claims it is “abundantly clear that the ‘pandemic’ is basically over and has been since June 2020.”
An 18-minute video announcing the group’s formation was posted on the ACU2020 website but has since been taken down by YouTube for violating its terms of service. Still, portions of the video featuring two doctors challenging the science behind the pandemic are circulating on Facebook with false assertions and statistics.
Staking out the group’s position, Elke De Klerk, a Dutch general practitioner, says on the video, “We do not have a pandemic” and calls COVID-19 a “normal flu virus” – claims flatly rejected by the WHO, CDC, and other experts.
De Klerk claims the pandemic designation was based on poor testing, with the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, molecular test returning false positive results in “89 to 94%” of the cases. That’s not true.
While the false positive rate remains an area of continued examination, preliminary studies show the test’s false positive rate is far less than De Klerk claims. A recent article in the British medical publication The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, said estimates in the U.K. place the false positive rate in the 0.8 to 4% range, while false negatives could run as high as 33%.
As for the virus that causes COVID-19, scientists universally agree it is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, not a strain of influenza.
While the death rate for COVID-19 remains uncertain, as we have reported, evidence suggests it is higher than for seasonal influenza.
In De Klerk’s own country, the Netherlands, there have been more than 6,800 deaths attributed to COVID-19 so far this year, compared to 2,900 due to flu and pneumonia in 2018-19.
In the U.S., where COVID-19 has caused more than 220,000 deaths, the worst flu season in the past decade killed an estimated 61,000 people in 2017-18, as we’ve reported. In fact, COVID-19 so far has killed more people in the U.S. than the past five flu seasons combined, and hundreds more die each day.  
In addition, a CDC study released Oct. 20 found hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration had a five times higher risk of death than patients with the flu.
The other speaker in the video circulating on Facebook is Dolores Cahill, a professor at the medical school at the University College Dublin in Ireland. Cahill, who has become something of a lightning rod as a COVID-19 denier, claims on the video that there have only been 98 deaths in Ireland due to the coronavirus since April.
But according to Ireland’s Central Statistics Office, more than 1,800 people have died of COVID-19 in the country, all but 200 since April.
And with cases on an upswing, the Irish government announced Oct. 19 that it was imposing tough new restrictions to slow the spread of the disease. The measures, which will last until at least Dec. 1, require all non-essential retail businesses, barbers, hairdressers, and salons to close and ban gatherings in homes. Restaurants and pubs will be limited to takeout and delivery service.
Cahill has found herself under fire from both her university, which issued a statement disassociating itself from her views, and the European Union, which asked her to resign from an EU medical panel.

115,Video: Understanding COVID-19 Antibody Tests,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/video-understanding-covid-19-antibody-tests/,,"In this video, we take a look at COVID-19 antibody tests, which can reveal whether someone was previously infected with the novel coronavirus — and explain why a positive or negative result may not always be so easy to interpret.

Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins the body generates as part of an immune response to a specific pathogen. Because the proteins are highly specific, tests that can check for the presence of antibodies in a person’s blood have the potential to identify people who have already encountered the virus.
Such information is critical to figuring out how widely the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, has spread, and could also be used to identify people who are immune.
But the tests are only beginning to be rolled out, and many are not accurate enough to use.
Further complicating any use of the tests in the clinic is that scientists don’t know whether antibodies can protect someone from becoming infected again with COVID-19. While experts strongly suspect that will be the case, it’s not known for certain yet, nor it is clear how long any potential immunity would last.

116,Video: Trump’s Exaggerated COVID-19 Drug Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/video-trumps-exaggerated-covid-19-drug-claims/,,"In this video, we look at President Donald Trump’s misleading claim that there’s “very strong evidence” to support his hope that a malaria drug can treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Trump has touted two malaria drugs — chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine — that also are approved for use to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But there is only limited evidence at this time to suggest the drugs are safe and effective against the new coronavirus.

A few lab studies show the drugs have antiviral effects against the new coronavirus in cells grown in culture. But that’s only in cells.
In the past, for example, chloroquine has been found to inhibit a variety of viruses in cells, including influenza and chikungunya. But when tested in animals or people, those results didn’t hold.
China has reportedly used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in some COVID-19 clinical trials, but most of those studies haven’t been published yet. One that has been published found “no significant reduction in time to clinical improvement or viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the conventional therapy control group,” according to a World Health Organization report.
The authors of the trial concluded that the drug needed to be tested in a larger group of patients. 
Despite the president’s enthusiasm for the potential of hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has cautioned that the evidence supporting the drug is anecdotal — and that it would take a large, well-done clinical trial to prove its effectiveness.

117,Trump Campaign Takes Pelosi’s Words Out of Context,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-campaign-takes-pelosis-words-out-of-context/,,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an April 14 interview that the Paycheck Protection Program was “very important,” and with a second round of funding, she wanted to “open this up to many more people,” specifically the “underbanked.” But that context is missing from a Trump campaign video.
The video, posted on Twitter by Brad Parscale, campaign manager for President Donald Trump’s reelection effort, leaves the false impression that Pelosi opposes replenishing funding for the small business loan program — a $349 billion coronavirus relief initiative that ran out of funding on April 16.
The video uses select quotes from Pelosi that appear to show her dismissing $250 billion in additional funding proposed by Republicans. But that’s not the whole story.

In the campaign video, Pelosi says: “They asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours. I said, well, I don’t think so.” In the April 14 interview on MSNBC, however, Pelosi prefaced that remark by asking, “Well, what happens to our underbanked folks?” Her next sentence after the quote in the video: “Let’s see how we can open this up to many more people.”
The video then shows on screen the words, “Americans Are Losing Their Jobs,” and Pelosi is heard saying, “they objected and I congratulate the Senate Democrats.” In the interview, those comments aren’t made in succession. Instead, Pelosi said, “I congratulate the Senate Democrats, they went to the floor when Mitch McConnell went in for his 250, and they said they objected.” Pelosi then said, “And then they said, we have another proposal which opens the door to the underbanked.”
In the interview, Pelosi was asked by host Chris Hayes about Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s desire to pass a clean $250 billion bill that just provided additional funds for the Paycheck Protection Program.
Here are Pelosi’s remarks in context:
Hayes, MSNBC interview, April 14: Why do you not want to just do that? What is — what are your priorities for this next piece of legislation?
Pelosi: Well, let me say that CARES One — we’re getting ready for CARES Two, but CARES One was a bill that had many good features. We were successful working together House and Senate Democrats in changing it from the corporate trickle down bill to a worker’s first pull up bill. Part of it is a Paycheck Protection Program, which is very important.
However, I will not allow anything to perpetuate the disparity and access to capital that exists in our country. And so what they said, first come first serve, ‘Oh we’re just serving the customers that we know at the bank.’ Well, what happens to our underbanked folks? So last week, when they came, they asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours. I said, well, I don’t think so. Let’s see how we can open this up to many more people.
So Chuck Schumer and I, and this all happened on the Senate side, and I congratulate the Senate Democrats, they went to the floor when Mitch McConnell went in for his 250, and they said they objected. And then they said, we have another proposal which opens the door to the underbanked. There’s $60 billion, 10% of what they were asking for to be used for community development, financial institutions [that] know the neighborhood, know the language, know the culture, know the people, know the businesses to enable them to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program.
In addition to that, we still gave them half the money, $125 billion, but we use some other for this initiative, and also for the grant and other loan programs that benefited everyone. OK, so then we also said, while we’re at it what we desperately need is support for state and local government as well as for hospital. This is urgent. And they just said no. They only were going for the 250. We said, let’s negotiate. Let’s see how we can come to some conclusion that will benefit all of the needs, the underbanked, the hospitals, the state and local governments who are carrying enormous burdens.
And also the hospitals still talking about testing with the imperative for us to have the data, the racial data that is in there so that we see how this is affecting everyone in our community. So we were not going to let all this money that is spent because of the coronavirus crisis which is heartbreaking, the number of people who have died or others have lost their loved ones and the rest. But we could not allow the big money that was put to fight it to perpetuate disparity and access to capital and access to care.
The original $349 billion for the small business loan program was part of the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES, which Trump signed into law on March 27 and included other measures such as increased unemployment benefits, refundable tax credits and grants to states. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office explained that the paycheck protection loan program was designed to help businesses maintain their payrolls for eight weeks.
“The full principal amount and any accrued interest on a PPP loan may be forgiven, although that forgiveness will be diminished if a borrower either decreases the number of employees on its payroll or reduces employees’ compensation. Amounts that are not forgiven must be paid back to lenders within two years at an interest rate of 1 percent,” CBO said in its analysis of the legislation.
The loan program proved so popular that it ran out of funding. A “small business” is defined as one with fewer than 500 employees, and restaurants with fewer than 500 workers per location met that definition. Some publicly traded companies secured millions in those loans, leading to criticism that it didn’t benefit the very small businesses that needed the money.
Shake Shack, which employs 8,000 in 189 restaurants, ended up returning the $10 million it had received, “so that those restaurants who need it most can get it now,” the founder and CEO said in a statement, explaining that the company was “able to access the additional capital we needed to ensure our long term stability through an equity transaction in the public markets.”
Democrats and Republicans have disagreed over the need to include additional measures — more funding for states and hospitals, sought by Democrats — in new legislation that would add funds for the Paycheck Protection Program. In her weekly press conference on April 16, Pelosi reiterated what she had said in that April 14 MSNBC interview.
“We want to make sure that these people have access – everybody in the small business arena has access to credit,” she said in the press conference. “We do not want the billions of dollars spent in the CARES 1 Act, which we fully support, but we do not want it to perpetuate the disparity of access to credit for some of our businesses.”
Plus, she spoke of “the need for us to have more funding for the hospitals and for the health – the state and local governments, whether talking about health care workers, police and fire, EMS, food delivery – all of that.”
The Trump campaign told us the video didn’t suggest that Pelosi had opposed the program overall, but that she supported delaying the funding in order to negotiate, a move Republicans clearly oppose. The campaign pointed to comments by Karen G. Mills, head of the Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013, during the Obama administration, who said in an April 16 interview with Roll Call, “Congress has to act as soon as possible.”
“Complexity is not our friend here,” Roll Call quoted Mills as saying. “Things that have to be implemented quickly can’t have a lot of bells and whistles, or else there will be too many unintended consequences — one of which is delay. And we don’t have time to delay.”
Zach Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told us: “It’s undeniable that Nancy Pelosi was proud of Democrats blocking more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program when American small businesses and workers desperately need a lifeline. While the Trump Administration successfully processed the equivalent of 14 years’ worth of paycheck loans in just 14 days, Pelosi’s opposition resulted in good, decent Americans getting hung out to dry.”
It’s a matter of opinion whether Democrats should have pushed to negotiate rather than agree to a $250 billion funding increase. But the video doesn’t make clear that Pelosi supported the Paycheck Protection Program overall. In fact, she said in the MSNBC interview that the Democrats “fully support” it.
The campaign video goes on to juxtapose clips of Pelosi on “The Late Late Show with James Corden” showing off her stockpile of candy and ice cream with clips about Americans being out of work and having trouble affording food.
At one point, Pelosi is shown laughing and eating ice cream after a TV news anchor says, “there are 22 million people out of work.” The president, and others, have criticized Pelosi for the optics of the ice cream segment at a time of economic hardship for many Americans. We leave it to readers to form their own opinions on that. But the editing of the video makes Pelosi appear indifferent to those out of work, contrary to her support for legislation to help those same people. 
On April 21, lawmakers and the White House reached a deal for $484 billion in funding, including $310  billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, with $60 billion of that specifically for community-based lenders and small- and medium-sized banks. A statement by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the legislation included $50 billion more for SBA emergency disaster lending and also funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing.
The Senate passed the bill, and the president said on Twitter that he would sign it.
A day earlier, while negotiations were still ongoing, Trump touted the fact that the bipartisan compromise would include more than the $250 billion that the Republicans originally sought.
“Look, we’re getting the paycheck plan. It’s — already $350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously. And we have another 250, which I think you’re going to find out is going to be a higher number than that. Okay? I won’t say it now, because I don’t know if they’ve released it or not, but it’s going to end up being more than $250 billion,” Trump said. “And this is going to small businesses and it’s going to workers. And these are really bipartisan plans. It’s a great thing that’s happening. So I think the fact that we’re able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great.”

118,Democratic Convention Night 2,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/democratic-convention-night-2/,,"Summary
It was another unconventional night for fact-checkers at the truncated Democratic National Convention that has been forced to go virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.
But we found a few statements to write about, including a misleading claim about the U.S. unemployment rate and auto industry bailout claims that don’t tell the whole story.
Analysis
On the night the Democratic Party formally nominated former Vice President Joe Biden as the party’s 2020 presidential nominee, two former U.S. presidents spoke — Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.
Clinton’s Misleading and Meaningless Unemployment Claim
Clinton, who uncharacteristically spoke for less than five minutes, made a misleading claim when he said that the U.S. is “the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple” because of President Donald Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s true that the unemployment rates listed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.S. jobless rate nearly tripling between January and the most recent month on record. The next-largest increase was a near-doubling of the rate in Canada.
But his comparison is meaningless — rather like comparing apples to kumquats. That’s because the U.S. counts a laid-off worker as “unemployed” even if the layoff is expected to be temporary — while many others do not. In July, those on “temporary layoff” accounted for 56% of all those counted as “unemployed” in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Clinton referred specifically to one of the countries that doesn’t include those temporarily laid off in their count of the jobless, saying the U.S. rate is “two and a half times the United Kingdom’s.”
It’s true that the U.K. Office for National Statistics currently lists its unemployment rate as only 3.9% compared with the U.S. rate of 10.2%. But, unlike the U.S., the U.K. doesn’t count those on temporary layoff as unemployed.
U.K. Office for National Statistics, August: Workers furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme … have a reasonable expectation of returning to their jobs after a temporary period of absence. Therefore they are classified as employed.
And that’s not the only factor making Clinton’s comparison misleading. Other countries — such as Germany — have met the COVID-19 crisis by subsidizing employers to keep workers on the payroll even when there is less work to do. In the U.S., the main approach has been to increase benefits paid to laid-off workers through unemployment insurance.
The OECD Employment Outlook 2020, which was released in July, notes that the U.S. has had a far higher unemployment rate during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with other OECD countries, saying the difference in rates “reflects fundamental differences in countries’ policy mix to cushion the economic and social effects of the crisis.”
“The United States are strongly relying on unemployment insurance benefits to secure the income of workers who lose their jobs, even in the case of a temporary crisis,” the report said. “Meanwhile, other OECD countries, not just in Europe, are making heavy use of job retention schemes, which allow companies to cut hours of work, or even halt work entirely, while keeping their workers attached.”
Auto Bailout
Michigan lawmakers praised Biden for his role in helping to rescue the auto industry after the Great Recession. It’s worth noting that while this remains a signature accomplishment of the Obama administration, the effort began under former President George W. Bush.
In a keynote address featuring several young Democratic politicians, Michigan state Rep. Mari Manoogian said: “When the auto industry was going under, Joe stuck his neck out to protect it and helped save 1.5 million auto jobs.” Later, during the roll call of the states, Michigan U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said, “Michigan auto workers are the best in the world. But we’d be nowhere without Joe Biden. And a lot of folks wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt. But Joe Biden believed in us, and together we fought to save our auto industry.”
As we’ve explained before, the auto industry effort began on Dec. 19, 2008, when then-President Bush announced that his administration would provide General Motors and Chrysler with $13.4 billion in loans under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, with another $4 billion to GM to come once Congress approved releasing the second half of the TARP money. The money came with strings, most notably the requirement that the automakers come up with a long-term viability plan by March 31, 2009.
Fast-forward to March 30, 2009, when then-President Barack Obama rejected the companies’ viability plans, but then announced a bankruptcy plan for Chrysler on April 30 and a GM bankruptcy plan on June 1. Those plans allowed the automakers to restructure and get more federal aid.
In the end, the Treasury Department invested about $80 billion in the industry and recouped most of it. Treasury says the rescue of the industry ended up costing the government $9.3 billion.
As for Manoogian’s claim that Biden “helped save 1.5 million auto jobs,” that’s backed up by an estimate from the Center for Automotive Research. The group’s 2013 report said the auto bailout saved 1.5 million jobs in 2010, including those at GM, Chrysler, auto suppliers and “spin-off employment losses” due to “reduced spending in the U.S. economy.”
The report credited both the Bush and Obama administrations.
“Two consecutive executive administrations in Washington decided in late 2008 and early 2009 that the consequences of the potential losses and outcomes to the U.S. economy and people described above were worth avoiding through a federal intervention,” the report said. “CAR is confident that in the years ahead, this peacetime intervention in the private sector by the U.S. government will be seen as one of the most successful in U.S. economic history.”
Trump and the New Hoax
In welcoming viewers to the second night of the convention, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said of the Democrats, “Unlike the president, we’ve never called COVID-19 a hoax.” As we have written, it is true that Trump said the novel coronavirus was the Democrats’ “new hoax.” But the president has said he was talking about the Democrats’ criticism of how he had handled the pandemic, not the disease itself.
At a political rally on Feb. 28 in South Carolina, Trump said, “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue.”
Then the president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as a hoax, made his “new hoax” remark.
Trump, Feb. 28: One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. 
Democrats quickly seized on the remark. Joe Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, described the president’s comments as “absolutely bizarre.”
“Look, this is a serious, serious problem,” Biden told MSNBC on Feb. 29. “It’s able to be solved, but it requires us to be absolutely level-headed and let the scientists have the lead in all of this. But for him to start talking about it being a hoax is absolutely dangerous. It’s just not a decent way to act.”
In the wake of the criticism, Trump said at a press conference on Feb. 29 that he used the term “hoax” to refer not to the coronavirus itself but to Democrats’ criticism of how his administration had responded to it.
Asked if he regretted using that particular word, he replied: “No, no, no. ‘Hoax’ referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here; I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.”

A Food and Drug Administration presentation on monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines listed possible adverse events the agency might track. But an Instagram post misrepresents the document, falsely claiming it shows the vaccines are known to cause harmful side effects — including death.

A popular Instagram post cites a government document to falsely claim that federal officials know that the COVID-19 vaccines cause death and other dangerous side effects — “yet will not publicly warn” citizens.

The image — shared on Instagram accounts such as “awaken_the_mind,” “the_truth_hunters” and “the_truth_hunters_2” — claims: “FDA DOCUMENTS: mRNA VACCINE CAUSES DEATH + 21 SIDE EFFECTS.” It goes on to allege that an “internal FDA document revealed a shocking revilation” about the purported side effects — such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, stroke, autoimmune disease and “pregnancy & birth outcomes.”
But the post is wrong. The Food and Drug Administration presentation cited, which is actually publicly available, doesn’t say that. And as we’ve previously reported, there is no evidence that vaccines have caused any deaths. As of March 15, the CDC reported that it has found “no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.”
The “mRNA” refers to one of the ways that COVID-19 vaccines are designed. The first two vaccines approved in the U.S. — one from Pfizer/BioNTech and the other from Moderna — both use modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins. That triggers an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. (For more, see our SciCheck stories, “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine“ and “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
The third vaccine approved in the U.S., a one-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, is designed differently and does not use mRNA.

The link cited at the bottom of the Instagram post goes to a presentation by Steve Anderson, who directs the Office of Biostatistics & Epidemiology at the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. That presentation was given at an Oct. 30 meeting by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a committee that provides vaccine-related guidance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Anderson’s report outlined a variety of ways that CBER would monitor vaccine safety upon rollout. The government uses several monitoring systems to that end.
One slide in Anderson’s presentation showed a “[w]orking list of possible adverse event outcomes” that the FDA planned to monitor — the list now cited in the Instagram post. It wasn’t addressing mRNA vaccines in particular, as the Instagram post claims.
And the presentation didn’t say the vaccines actually are known to cause those health issues, let alone kill people. The same misrepresentation was made by a dubious website in December and debunked by our fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact and the Associated Press.
An FDA spokesperson told us that “the document cited is a slide deck on how FDA would plan to conduct safety surveillance on a potential COVID-19 vaccine once authorized” and noted the same deck was also presented at an earlier FDA advisory committee meeting in October.
“No specific COVID-19 vaccine was discussed at that meeting, but rather that meeting was held to discuss — in general — the criteria FDA may take into account when making a decision about emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine,” the spokesperson said. “The list of adverse events on slide 16 is a list of possible outcomes that the FDA could potentially monitor for when conducting safety surveillance once a vaccine was authorized.”
Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University, told us in a phone interview that it’s “unfortunate” that the list — part of a precautionary safety process — is being misconstrued to wrongly suggest that the vaccines are dangerous.

There’s a difference between a report of an adverse event following immunization and an adverse event caused by the vaccine, he said. Officials develop a list of adverse events following immunization to monitor in order to proactively ensure the vaccine rollout is safe. The list is compiled by experts using a variety of factors; for example, officials may want to track outcomes associated with the disease from which the vaccines are designed to protect.
By tracking specific adverse events that are reported through its various surveillance systems, the government can conduct rapid analyses to determine whether any observed events following vaccination are more common than expected, Salmon said. In other words, experts can assess whether any health outcomes that are observed are consistent with what would be expected in a given population.


“The message here should be: government’s being careful, being cautious, being prudent,” he said.

According to the CDC, the ongoing monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccines is “the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.” And in the months since the distortion first spread, tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been safely administered in the country.
With more than 109 million doses administered in the U.S. as of March 15, the CDC says, it received 1,913 reports through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System of deaths that took place after someone received a vaccine. As we’ve explained before, reports of deaths through VAERS do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event, since anyone can submit reports — regardless of whether an immunization is thought to have contributed to the event.
CDC and FDA physicians review the facts surrounding each death reported through VAERS. And the CDC reported on March 15: “A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.”
Many people who get the vaccines experience mild side effects — such as pain at the injection site, a headache, chills or fever — the CDC notes. A “small number of people have had a severe allergic reaction (called ‘anaphylaxis’) after vaccination, but this is extremely rare. If this occurs, vaccination providers have medicines available to effectively and immediately treat the reaction.”
Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says “women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.” As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered.

120,Trump’s False Coronavirus Claim About Lupus Patients,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-false-coronavirus-claim-about-lupus-patients/,,"President Donald Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. This time, the president falsely claimed that “people with lupus” who take hydroxychloroquine “aren’t catching this horrible virus.”
While it’s too early to say whether or not hydroxychloroquine has any protective effects, it’s not true that no lupus patients have developed the disease. In fact, the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance’s registry of COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic disease had 110 validated patients, as of April 2, and 17% of them have lupus.
“We can say that this drug is likely not 100% effective in preventing or treating COVID, and that SLE [systemic lupus erythematosus] patients should not let their guard down,” Dr. Jean Liew, administrative lead for the alliance, told us in an email.
Trump made his remarks at a coronavirus press briefing on April 4. The president has said he is a “big fan” of using hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment — even though, as we have reported, there is limited evidence yet that it works.
Trump, April 4: We’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data. But I’ll just speak for myself: It’s been out for a long time. It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for lupus. And there’s a — there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus. They’re not — they’re not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that’s correct; maybe it’s false. You’re going to have to check it out.
We did check it out.
The White House did not offer any support for the president’s claim that “people with lupus aren’t catching” the coronavirus. However, there is evidence from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance that he is wrong.
The international alliance was formed to “help guide rheumatology clinicians in assessing and treating patients with rheumatologic disease.” The alliance — which is supported by the Lupus Foundation of America, Lupus Research Alliance and the American College of Rheumatology — has called on clinicians to report “all cases of COVID-19 in rheumatology patients, including those with mild or no symptoms.” 
As of April 2, the group had information on 110 validated patients: 36% with rheumatoid arthritis, 17% with psoriatic arthritis and 17% with systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, an autoimmune disease. 
“One frequently asked question: over 25% of patients who developed a COVID-19 were on HCQ at the time of diagnosis,” the group said in a tweet thread on April 2, referring to hydroxychloroquine.
“Based on early data currently available in our registry, we are not able to report any evidence of a protective effect from hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19,” the group said in an April 4 tweet. To be clear, that doesn’t mean there isn’t one — but there aren’t signs so far, and ultimately, the question will have to be answered in a randomized controlled trial.
Although the data does show that lupus patients get COVID-19, Liew cautioned us that “there are many caveats to making further inference from registry data,” especially since “this is a voluntary registry and will not capture all patients living with rheumatic disease, such as lupus, who test positive for COVID-19.”
Liew also said that Trump may have been referring to an unpublished study out of China on the effects of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.
That study, which was posted to medRxiv on March 30, said: “Interestingly, through a follow-up survey, we found that none of our 80 SLE patients who took long-term oral HCQ had been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection or appeared to have related symptoms.” SARS-CoV-2 is the official name of the virus that causes COVID-19.
“The authors do not provide details about the survey, such as whether there was a larger number of lupus patients surveyed (the denominator), out of which 80 were able to respond and say they did not have COVID-19,” Liew pointed out. “We cannot draw any causal conclusions from those data, either.”
In the April 4 press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked “what you’re seeing as far as lupus patients, in regards to coronavirus.” Fauci said, “We don’t have any definitive information to be able to make any comment that that — it’s an obvious good question, because it might be a way for us to get some interesting and potentially important data as to the role of those medications. But that’s something that is now being looked at, but we don’t have any data to be able to say anything definitively.”
That has been a consistent message from the experts: It’s still unknown whether hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. More study is needed.
Several clinical trials are planned in the U.S. to test hydroxychloroquine’s ability to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such study — a multi-site clinical trial that is being led by the University of Washington School of Medicine — will seek to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results won’t be known until, at best, this summer. 
Until more is known, the Lupus Foundation of America urges lupus patients — and there are about 1.5 million Americans with the disease — to protect themselves as best they can from the highly transmissible coronavirus.
On the day that Trump made his false claim about lupus patients, the Lupus Foundation of America put out a statement that said, “There is no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is effective in preventing a person from contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19). People with lupus should follow the guidance of their doctor and the safety guidelines being issued by the CDC.”",Eugene Kiely,2020-04-06 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“We cannot draw any causal conclusions from those data, either.”

121,No Evidence That Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/no-evidence-that-flu-shot-increases-risk-of-covid-19/,,"Quick Take
A claim being pushed on social media and by an organization skeptical of vaccines is using a military study to falsely suggest that the flu vaccine increases someone’s risk of contracting COVID-19. The study does not say that, and the Military Health System advises people to get the flu shot.

Full Story 
Federal health officials are warning that the novel coronavirus outbreak could resurge in the fall, presenting a significant public health quandary: fighting both COVID-19 and the flu at the same time.
Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted the importance of the flu vaccine in controlling the spread of influenza in a recent interview with the Washington Post. He said the flu shot “may allow there to be a hospital bed available for your mother or grandmother that may get coronavirus.”
But social media posts are singing a different tune, cautioning against the flu shot by falsely suggesting that the vaccine increases the chances of getting COVID-19 by “36%.”
The argument is being pushed in a post by Children’s Health Defense — an organization founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism — headlined “Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36% (and Other Supporting Studies).” The post, republished elsewhere, pointed to “peer-reviewed, published studies” to “prove” that advice offered by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper in March for people to get the flu shot “may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.”
That’s wrong.
First of all, experts say there has been no study connecting the flu shot with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
The central study cited by the Children’s Health Defense is a 2019 Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch study that probed the theory that “influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses” — a concept known as “virus interference.”
Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told us that the theory rests on the idea that “if you get a flu infection, for example, maybe for some period of time your immune response to that flu infection reduces your risk of getting infected by some other virus.” 
Belongia said virus interference has been the subject of speculation and some studies with mixed results, but there is ultimately little data to support it. A 2013 study he worked on, cited in the AFHSB study, found that “influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.”
In fact, the AFHSB study concluded that its “overall results … showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination.”
The erroneous claim that the study shows a heightened risk for COVID-19 for those vaccinated for the flu hinges on the study’s suggestion that vaccinated individuals appeared more likely to get “coronavirus.”
But the study looked at four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.
What’s more, Belongia said, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person has an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone’s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they’ve been vaccinated for the flu.
Different viruses affect different age groups and circulate at different times, he said. “It can be easily explained just by random variation and the fact that they didn’t adjust for confounding variables.”
The Military Health System, of which the AFHSB is a part, noted in a statement to FactCheck.org that the study used data collected two years before the emergence of COVID-19 and looked at the seasonal coronaviruses — “impacting children and adults with no serious complications” — which “do not have the potential for epidemic or pandemic spread.”
“The study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19,” the MHS said.
Furthermore, the statement said, “it’s also important to note the study found evidence of significant protection by influenza vaccination against not only multiple forms of the flu, but other, very serious non-influenza viruses, such as parainfluenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and non-influenza virus coinfections. It remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.”
There have been some results suggestive of virus interference, which the Children’s Health Defense cites in its post. But none of the studies referenced assessed risks of the flu shot when it comes to COVID-19.
For example, Sharon Rikin, an assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, said in an email that a 2018 study she worked on “showed an association with flu vaccination and a slightly higher risk of non-flu acute respiratory infections (such as the common cold) in children. However, this association was not seen in adults.”
“In medicine, we are always weighing the risks and benefits of treatments. In this case, we know that the flu vaccine is safe and effective to reduce illness and death among children and adults every year,” Rikin added. “We have not studied the association between flu vaccination and risk of COVID-19. Fortunately, COVID-19 is typically not causing significant illness in children. However, preventing illness and death from flu still remains extremely important for children.”
Rikin said “just because we found an association between flu vaccines and acute respiratory infections does not mean that the flu vaccine actually caused there to be a higher risk of infections.” She said the group struggled to find a “biologically plausible explanation” and that while “there is a small body of literature that hypothesizes that the phenomenon of shifts in viral prevalence could be caused by viral interference,” there is not “strong empirical evidence of this occurring.”
Belongia told us that, ultimately, the evidence of virus interference through such studies “is weak and inconclusive.”
“Overall, we do not see evidence of virus interference that is sufficient to raise concerns about flu vaccination and COVID-19 risk,” he said. “Serious COVID-19 disease occurs primarily in adults, and we do not have evidence of flu vaccine causing virus interference in adult age groups.”
He said that getting the flu shot, if anything, is especially important because of potential problems posed by the combination of the flu and COVID-19, both for the health care system and individuals.
Likewise, Richard Ellison, a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and hospital epidemiologist at UMass Memorial Medical Center, told us in an email that “getting the flu itself carries very significant morbidity and potentially mortality — so we don’t want someone to get the flu in the first place.”
“In addition, while having the flu may boost the immune system, it can significantly weaken someone’s overall health status, and make them more susceptible to complications should they be unfortunate enough to have both influenza and COVID-19 in the same year.”
Update, April 27: We removed a reference to a 2017 study, which was cited by the Children’s Health Defense, and a quote from one of its authors, because the study’s methodology and veracity have been disputed.

122,Navarro Doesn’t Give Full Picture On Hydroxychloroquine,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/navarro-doesnt-give-full-picture-on-hydroxychloroquine/,,"White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has promoted the “astonishing” results of an observational study that found hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality for patients hospitalized for COVID-19. But the study has limitations, and multiple randomized controlled trials have found the drug is not beneficial to hospitalized patients.
In a July 7 press conference, Navarro highlighted the results of a study from the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan, saying it “showed an astonishing 50% reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine,” and that “importantly, the study was based on what’s called early treatment.”
Minutes earlier in a CNN interview, Navarro, who is an assistant to the president and director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, also referenced the study, saying of hydroxychloroquine: “It appears to work … in a very significant way,” adding, “It will save lives.”
Outside experts, however, dispute the notion that the Henry Ford study treated its patients much earlier than other studies, and are skeptical of its findings, as they clash with every other rigorously performed study testing the drug against the coronavirus.
“All the evidence points to [hydroxychloroquine] not being effective for improving mortality outcomes in the hospital,” said Eli Rosenberg, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the State University of New York’s University at Albany, who has conducted a hydroxychloroquine study. “So this definitely stands quite at odds with where all the science currently is.”
Navarro also announced that based on the new findings, physicians from Henry Ford were petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine for early hospitalized COVID-19 patients, outpatients and for prophylaxis, or prevention.
The health system confirmed in a statement to FactCheck.org that it had “formally asked the FDA for reconsideration of their Emergency Use Authorization of the drug for a clearly defined list of clinical uses, including use in clinical trials,” but did not answer additional questions about the request.
Because hydroxychloroquine is approved for other uses, physicians can legally prescribe the drug for any reason, but without the EUA, the drug cannot be obtained from the Strategic National Stockpile.
The FDA previously revoked its hydroxychloroquine EUA for hospitalized patients on June 15, citing the findings of a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K., among other evidence. The agency determined that the drug was unlikely to be effective and the potential benefits of its use no longer outweighed the risks, given the possibility of serious cardiac side effects.
Navarro, notably, did not mention that three randomized controlled trials — considered the highest level of evidence in science — all failed to find that hydroxychloroquine benefits patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
The Henry Ford study, which was published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases on July 1, looked back at the outcomes of 2,541 patients who were admitted to the hospital system and were given hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin, both drugs or neither. It was observational and did not randomize patients to treatment groups, nor did it blind patients or physicians to the medications that were given.
In touting the new study, Navarro also gave the misleading impression that the bulk of the evidence favors hydroxychloroquine, which is an antimalarial that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
“There’s over 60 studies that we’ve looked at on a spreadsheet. Fifty of them support the therapeutic or prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine,” he said. “The 11 that don’t, a good number of those are discredited studies.”
We asked the White House for the spreadsheet or its contents, but did not receive a reply. There is one retracted study, published in the Lancet on May 22, that claimed hydroxychloroquine did not benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients and may have increased mortality. Those conclusions, however, were based on registry data from the company Surgisphere, which other scientists found highly suspicious and did not match up with government reports. Three of the authors retracted the paper about two weeks later when the underlying data could not be verified.
But as we’ve written, numerous other investigations — including the strongest studies — have consistently found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Although the results are not yet published, the RECOVERY trial in the U.K., which included 1,542 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 3,132 patients receiving usual care, found no difference in survival nor improvement in hospital stay or other outcomes.
“These data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19,” the investigators said in a June 5 press release that also announced the end of the hydroxychloroquine part of the trial.
“Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs,” said Dr. Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford and the trial’s lead investigator.
The National Institutes of Health announced on June 20 that it, too, was halting its hydroxychloroquine trial in hospitalized patients, known as ORCHID, after a data and safety monitoring board reviewed interim data. 
While hydroxychloroquine was not harmful, the board concluded the drug was “very unlikely to be beneficial” to hospitalized patients, according to the agency’s news release. The trial was a blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, and at the time of closure, included more than 470 enrollees who were currently hospitalized or expected to be hospitalized for COVID-19.
The NIH told us by email that investigators were continuing to follow participants and were working toward publication, although given follow-up and time to analyze data, this might take a couple months.
On June 17, the World Health Organization also suspended the hydroxychloroquine arm of its randomized controlled trial, known as Solidarity, given lack of efficacy in hospitalized patients.
On July 4, the WHO officially accepted the trial’s steering committee’s decision to discontinue the hydroxychloroquine arm based on the interim results and other trials, noting that the interim findings show that hydroxychloroquine produces “little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care.” 
The agency said the findings were being “readied” for peer-reviewed publication and that its decision does not apply to hydroxychloroquine trials in non-hospitalized patients or those testing the drug for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.
Indeed, other trials are still in the works regarding outpatient treatment and prevention, including a very large prevention trial among front-line workers at Henry Ford. The first two randomized controlled trials to announce results on hydroxychloroquine as a preventive, however, have not shown any benefit, including one trial from the University of Minnesota and another in Barcelona, Spain.
In addition to Navarro, President Donald Trump, who has long backed hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 despite a lack of evidence — and even claimed to take the drug — cheered the Henry Ford findings. On July 6, he shared snippets of the study’s press release in tweets, and later suggested that he had been vindicated.
“The highly respected Henry Ford Health System just reported, based on a large sampling, that HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE cut the death rate in certain sick patients very significantly,” he said in a tweet. “The Dems disparaged it for political reasons (me!). Disgraceful. Act now,” he added, tagging the FDA.
We’ll review the Henry Ford findings and put them in context with the other results to give a more complete picture of where hydroxychloroquine really stands.
Observational Study With Some Oddities
In the Henry Ford study, 18.1% of all patients died in the hospital, compared with 13.5% who received hydroxychloroquine, 22.4% who received azithromycin, 20.1% who received both drugs and 26.4% who received neither. 
After controlling for demographics, various risk factors and some markers of disease severity, the authors found that getting hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced risk of death. 
In another similar analysis, in which the authors matched 190 patients who received hydroxychloroquine with 190 corresponding patients who did not get the drug, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a 51% reduction in the risk of death.
Experts, however, said that because the study was not a randomized trial, it’s difficult to know whether the effect the study’s authors identified is real.
“The concern with any retrospective observational cohort,” explained Dr. David Boulware, a professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota Medical School, “is selection bias.” 
“The question is, the people who got the medicine, are they the same as the people who didn’t get the medicine,” he said. “They try to control for that, they do multivariable adjustments and things like that, but there’s still things you can’t totally control statistically to try to compensate for how physicians act.”
In particular, several scientists suspect that the patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine may have been more likely to be sicker or more frail and less likely to get as much treatment.
The first clue comes from the fact that while the hospital system seemed to give most patients hydroxychloroquine according to its standardized protocol, a sizable chunk did not receive it.
“When you have a protocol in your hospital and many patients aren’t following the protocol, it makes you think that there’s something different about those patients,” said Dr. Neil Schluger, chair of the department of medicine at New York Medical College, and senior author of another observational study of hydroxychloroquine. “So the comparison right away becomes a little bit problematic.”
Some patients with cardiac issues were excluded from receiving hydroxychloroquine, given safety concerns of the drug. While that’s a reasonable clinical decision, University at Albany’s Rosenberg said, it’s unclear if that meant those patients ended up in the no treatment group in the study.
“They took those people out who have these elevated risks of mortality,” he said. “That will alter the analysis in a fundamental way.”
Another hint: Hydroxychloroquine patients were more likely to be ventilated and enter the ICU, but were less likely to die than those who didn’t get the drug — even though being ventilated and admitted to the ICU are risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes.
“That’s very curious,” Rosenberg said, adding that it suggests that many patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine might have been in a “low medical intervention situation,” such as having end-of-life orders.
“Why did more patients who got hydroxychloroquine go to the ICU?” Schluger asked. “It makes you think those patients were treated more aggressively than patients who didn’t get hydroxychloroquine.”
A commentary published with the Henry Ford article also hit upon this counterintuitive result. “Were the decision to withhold treatment related to poor prognosis (e.g. palliative intent), it stands to reason that patients receiving neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin would have the highest mortality,” the authors wrote. “Indeed, the non-treated group had an overall mortality that was higher than the rate of admission to the ICU (26.4% vs. 15.2%), suggesting that many patients were not considered appropriate for critical care.”
Along similar lines, the commentary authors, who were physicians and researchers in Canada and Australia, noted that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine were more than twice as likely to be prescribed steroid medications.
“This is relevant considering the recent RECOVERY trial that showed a mortality benefit with [the steroid] dexamethasone among individuals requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation,” the authors wrote, “potentially biasing this study’s results in favor of hydroxychloroquine.”
The study also did not provide information about how patients fared at different time points, which could have influenced outcomes.
“As the Henry Ford Health System became more experienced in treating patients with COVID-19, survival may have improved, regardless of the use of specific therapies,” the commentary said. 
Schluger also noticed that when the Henry Ford authors matched the hydroxychloroquine patients to those who did not receive the drug, the analysis included only a small fraction — 190 — of the more than 2,500 patients. 
“That to me seems quite unusual and really indicates that the patients just weren’t the same,” Schluger said. When he used the technique in his observational study, he included 1,085 patients out of a total of 1,446.
But rather than comparing the observational studies, Schluger said the larger point is that there are randomized controlled trials now.
“The vast majority of evidence by now — I mean, really, an overwhelming amount of evidence — suggests that hydroxychloroquine has no effect,” he said. “And now we have randomized controlled trials, so in a sense the whole issue of observational studies is a little bit moot.”
Unsubstantiated Claim About Earlier Treatment
A central claim, both by Navarro, and the authors of the study, is that early treatment is a key reason why the results were positive for hydroxychloroquine this time, whereas in the past they have been negative.
“We attribute our findings that differ from other studies to early treatment, and part of a combination of interventions that were done in supportive care of patients, including careful cardiac monitoring,” said Dr. Marcus Zervos, the division head of infectious disease for Henry Ford Health System, and a co-author of the study.
But other experts say there’s little to back that claim.
“I don’t believe that at all,” said Boulware, “because they don’t have data to support that.” The Henry Ford study, he said, specifically said that it did not catalog when patients’ symptoms began, making it impossible to know whether the hospital treated patients any sooner or not.
The health system did treat patients soon upon admission — 82% within a day, and 91% within two. But, as Boulware said, “in the other studies they were also being treated early, so it wasn’t like that was unique.”
In Rosenberg’s observational study, which the Henry Ford paper explicitly cited in its discussion as having included patients who received hydroxychloroquine at any time during hospitalization, the median time to the first hydroxychloroquine dose was one day. (The Henry Ford authors also claimed mortality was “significantly higher” in this study, but the overall mortality was 20.3% — just a few percentage points above its own.)
“This idea that somehow these folks were treated earlier in Michigan,” Rosenberg said, “that’s not consistent with the data.”
In Schluger’s observational study, 46% were treated within 24 hours after arriving at the emergency room, and 86% were treated within 48 hours.
How the Henry Ford study compares with the large clinical trials is unknown, since those details have not yet been published. The NIH, however, told us that in its trial, patients needed to test positive for the coronavirus within the past 10 days to be eligible, and that patients were excluded if it had been more than 10 days from the beginning of any acute respiratory symptoms.
It’s possible that hydroxychloroquine does need to be given early to show any effect, Boulware said, even if the Henry Ford study cannot make that claim. 
But that answer best comes from a randomized controlled trial. Boulware said he was aware of nine randomized controlled trials testing hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 outpatients; two have results but are not yet published, while the others are struggling with enrollment. One from the NIH closed on June 20 when it had enrolled only 20 people.
Giving hydroxychloroquine very early — before or after exposure to the coronavirus, for prevention — is also still a possibility, although Boulware’s post-exposure study did not find the drug to be effective, and another unpublished trial also turned up negative.
Navarro can say hydroxychloroquine is still worth studying, but it’s misleading to classify the vast majority of evidence as positive, and to fail to mention several randomized controlled trials that found no benefit in hospitalized patients when playing up a study that was also conducted in hospitalized patients.
“It’s very interesting that of all the administration people, the only person that they can get to come out and promote hydroxychloroquine is not a physician,” said Boulware. “That should probably be a big red flag.”

123,"One Photo, Two Stories — But No Deceit by News Websites",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/one-photo-two-stories-but-no-deceit-by-news-websites/,,"Quick Take
A viral post compares side-by-side screenshots from two news websites to falsely claim that using the same image of people at the beach during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of media deception. The location of the scene in Jacksonville, Florida, is identified accurately in each news report.
Full Story
Just over a month after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, the White House issued guidance for states to start lifting business restrictions implemented to slow the spread of the disease.
A day after that announcement, some beaches in Florida reopened on a limited basis. A picture of crowds on one such beach was used recently by two different news websites.
The New York Post used it to illustrate a story about beaches opening on a limited basis near Jacksonville, Florida, which is where the photo was taken.
The other site used it in a Facebook post that linked to a regularly updated blog about the pandemic, which, at the time, included an entry about beaches opening in Florida. That blog also included an entry on the COVID-19 death toll in Los Angeles, which provided the headline that showed up on Facebook underneath the picture. That juxtaposition could have confused readers, but anyone who clicked through on the link would have seen that the blog covered multiple issues.
The site that posted the link on Facebook is called News Break, a news aggregating company. A spokesman for News Break, Greg Vederman, explained in a phone interview that the site’s algorithm handles social media posts. In this case, it pulled a picture from the blog showing the beach in Florida and a headline about the death toll in Los Angeles.
Side-by-side screenshots of the same photo being used under different headlines are now circulating in a viral social media post suggesting that they prove the media is deceitful. Above the two screenshots is text that says: “That’s weird the exact same people who visited the beach in Florida are now at the beaches in California? Lol… awake yet?”
But there’s nothing amiss in how the photo was used in either case.
When it was used in the Post story, it illustrated the central topic. When it was used in News Break’s Facebook post, it illustrated one of several topics addressed in the linked blog post. By simply clicking through on the link, readers could see that the blog featured an entry on the beaches in Florida as well as an entry on the death toll in one California city.

124,Trump’s Confusing Claim on Italy and Travel Restrictions,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-confusing-claim-on-italy-and-travel-restrictions/,,"We could find no evidence to support President Donald Trump’s claim that Italy was “hit hard” by the coronavirus pandemic because “a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy” when the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on China.
In fact, Italy cut off air travel to and from China two days before the U.S. enacted its travel restrictions.
Trump’s claim came at the end of his daily coronavirus press conference on April 19, when he was asked about countries that did not respond appropriately and were subsequently hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump, April 19: When I closed up our border, when I did the ban on China, they say a lot of the people that didn’t come in here went to Italy. You’ve heard that. That’s why Italy was hit so hard.
I don’t think it was because of government. I will say Italy is locked down probably more than any other country right now. It’s just absolutely locked solid down. But they got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come, because I closed the country in January, and they went to Italy. They say it had to do with trade. It had to do with the purchase of certain materials, and Italy was another alternative. And so many, many people went to Italy instead of coming here. And Italy has suffered greatly.
It is a perplexing claim because, as we have reported before, Italy stopped all flights to and from China on Jan. 31. Although the White House announced its travel restrictions on China the same day, they did not go into effect until Feb. 2.
Trump was wrong to say he “closed the country in January.” As we have written, the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. There were exceptions to that halt on travel, including for Americans and their family members.
According to a New York Times report on April 4, nearly 40,000 people had arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China since Trump imposed his travel restrictions. Moreover, the Times found, “screening procedures have been uneven” for those arriving on flights from China.
By contrast, Italy’s policy banned all flights between the countries, and unlike the U.S. policy, it did not carve out exceptions for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
We reached out to the White House for clarification or evidence to back up the president’s claim, but we got no response.
“I honestly cannot make heads or tails of what the President is claiming here,” Ron Klain, who served as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator, told us via email. Klain once served as former Vice President Joe Biden’s chief of staff and is now an adviser to the Biden campaign. “It really makes no sense at all. The facts are, as you know, that Italy did restrict travel from China before the U.S. did, so his first assertion is based on a lie. And the second thing is, if people really were going to Italy in late Jan/Feb, why did the President wait until March … to impose a limit on travel from Italy to the U.S.?”
Italy was hit early and particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic. In mid-March, Italy had the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths outside China, and far more than any other country in Europe (and vastly higher than the number of cases and deaths in the U.S. at that time). Since then, the U.S. has far surpassed the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Italy, though the number of per capita deaths in Italy remains among the highest in the world — and higher than in the U.S.
But the timeline of reported cases and responses by Italy and the U.S. does not support Trump’s claim that Italy “got hit very hard because people that were coming to the United States couldn’t come, because I closed the country in January, and they went to Italy.”
The first two cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were disclosed on Jan. 30, when the government reported that two Chinese tourists who had arrived in Milan on Jan. 23 had been hospitalized. A day later, Italy immediately banned all air travel between Italy and China, without exceptions. (By contrast, Trump announced his travel restrictions on China 10 days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first travel-related case of COVID-19 in the U.S.) A cluster of cases emerged in early March in northern Italy, triggering tight quarantine restrictions in 15 northern and central provinces. The restrictions were quickly expanded nationwide.
It is possible that people came into Italy from China via indirect routes, but it seems unlikely that would have included Chinese tourists barred from entering the U.S. As the Washington Post noted, China canceled all domestic and international tour groups on Jan. 26, although those already underway were permitted to continue to their completion. That predates the U.S. travel restrictions.
Trump said, “They say it had to do with trade. It had to do with the purchase of certain materials, and Italy was another alternative.” But the U.S. travel restrictions did not impact cargo shipments between the countries (either by air or sea), according to a Department of Homeland Security fact sheet on the travel restrictions.
We couldn’t find any news reports about U.S. travel restrictions on China contributing to an influx of people to Italy, and worsening its coronavirus situation. Rather, experts have cited a number of reasons why the coronavirus resulted in an explosion of deaths in Italy, including the country’s relatively aged population, the density of the population, ineffective public health intervention in some areas of the country, and a shortage of intensive care hospital beds.
In an article published in the Journal of Global Health, Igor Rudan, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, wrote that “it is possible that Chinese tourists from Wuhan were visiting Northern Italy in January and February 2020” and that infected tourists who were asymptomatic were allowed to enter the country even with proper checks.
Rudan also noted that “[s]ome investigative journalists hypothesized, although this has not been confirmed, that it may be possible that the phenomenon of the mass immigration of Chinese workers to northern Italy [mainly for work in the textile and fashion industries] may have contributed to the early introduction and spread of the virus. … Whether through Chinese tourists, textile workers, or through some other route, the novel coronavirus has triggered an epidemic behind the back of the Italian ‘first line of defence’ which remained unrecognized in the first few weeks.”
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is currently in Italy with his wife, backed that theory, telling Fox News that the direct flights between Wuhan and Milan may have triggered the coronavirus outbreak in Italy.
“None of us, at least I didn’t know that there were 100,000 Chinese [people] living in northern Italy and that many of them come from Wuhan and that there was a flight between Milan and Wuhan,” Gingrich said. “We think that’s how the virus got Italy early. Initially, the government didn’t realize how dangerous it was going to be. It dealt with it initially as sort of a small town, local regional problem, and then boom, it exploded.”
Even if that were the case, that mass migration from China to Italy predated the U.S. travel restrictions. And it is unclear why or how, as Trump alleged, “many, many people went to Italy instead of coming here” after the U.S. imposed travel restrictions on China. As we explained, Italy had already banned all flights from China before the U.S. implemented restrictions. We will update this story if further information emerges.

125,"Atlas, Paul Mislead on Preexisting COVID-19 ‘Immunity’",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/atlas-paul-mislead-on-preexisting-covid-19-immunity/,,"Coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas and Sen. Rand Paul have misleadingly suggested that much of the U.S. population has immunity to the coronavirus due to previous exposure to similar viruses. But scientists say any possible protection is theoretical — and can’t be relied upon to control the pandemic.
Paul, who is a Republican from Kentucky, broached the idea of preexisting immunity to the coronavirus during a Senate hearing on Sept. 23. 
In a heated exchange with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Paul argued that the reason why New York’s outbreak is now largely under control is because of community, or herd, immunity — and not because the population followed public health guidelines.
Fauci, Sept. 23: Right now, if you look at what’s going on right now, the things that are going on in New York to get their test positivity 1% or less is because they are looking at the guidelines that we have put together from the task force of the four or five things of masks, social distancing, outdoors more than indoors, avoiding crowds and washing hands.
Paul: Or they’ve developed enough community immunity that they’re no longer having the pandemic because they have enough immunity in New York City to actually stop it.
Fauci: I challenge that, senator. … You were not listening to what the director of the CDC said, that in New York, it’s about 22%. If you believe 22% is herd immunity, I believe you’re alone in that.
Paul: There’s also the preexisting immunity of those who have cross-reactivity, which is about a third of the public in many estimates … which would actually get you to about two-thirds.
Fauci: I’d like to talk to you about that also because there was a study that recently came out that preexisting immunity to coronaviruses that are common cold do not cross-react with the COVID-19.
It’s unclear which study Fauci was thinking of — NIAID’s press office did not respond to our inquiry — but Paul’s office told us he was referencing research on immune cells known as T cells from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.
As we’ll explain, there are studies showing that some people have T cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2, or the novel coronavirus. But there’s no reason to think those cells would contribute to herd immunity, which occurs when enough of the population is immune to prevent spread of the disease.


Scientists have generally found that people do not harbor cross-reactive antibodies that can actually prevent infection with the coronavirus and that would be meaningful for herd immunity.
Although scientists are still debating what the herd immunity threshold is, most epidemiologists estimate that between 40% to 70% of a population would need to be vaccinated or have prior exposure to the virus for an outbreak to begin to die out.
Later that day, Atlas, the newest member of the coronavirus task force and a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, also brought up preexisting immunity in a press briefing at the White House.
When asked about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield’s testimony, in which he said preliminary CDC antibody testing results showed that “more than 90% of the population remains susceptible” to COVID-19, Atlas said Redfield had “misstated” the findings.
Atlas, Sept. 23: The data on the susceptible that he was talking about was his surveillance data that showed that roughly 9% of the country has antibodies. But when you look at the CDC data state by state, much of that data is old. Some of it goes back to March or April, before many of these states had the cases. That’s point number one.
Point number two is that the immunity to the infection is not solely determined by the percent of people who have antibodies. If you look at the research — and there’s been about 24 papers at least on the immunity from T-cells — that’s a different type of immunity than antibodies. And without being boring, the reality is that — according to the papers from Sweden, Singapore and elsewhere — there is cross-immunity, highly likely from other infections, and there is also T-cell immunity. And the combination of those makes the antibodies a small fraction of the people that have immunity.
So the answer is no, it is not 90% of people that are susceptible to the infection.
A neuroradiologist who researches health policy, Atlas wasn’t trained as an immunologist, infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist. He has reportedly backed a “herd immunity” approach to the pandemic, although he denies embracing such a strategy.
Both Redfield and Fauci have expressed concerns about Atlas and the accuracy of the information he imparts to the president and the public, although Atlas maintains that he is following the science.
In a phone call on a commercial airline, Redfield was overheard saying, “Everything he says is false,” according to an NBC News report. A federal official similarly told CNN that the CDC head was worried that Atlas was providing Trump with misleading information.
When asked in a Sept. 28 CNN interview whether Atlas was misleading the president, Fauci replied, “Well, yeah, I’m concerned that sometimes things are said that are really taken either out of context or actually incorrect.”
Cross-Reactive T Cells
Paul and Atlas reference studies that suggest a good chunk of people have T cells in their bodies that “cross-react” with SARS-CoV-2, even though they’ve never been exposed to the virus before.
These studies do indeed exist — but both men inaccurately conclude that people with cross-reactive T cells will be protected from becoming infected with the virus, when that’s almost certainly not the case.
A paper published in May by researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in the journal Cell, for example, found that about half of the 11 tested blood samples from unexposed donors contained T cells that could recognize SARS-CoV-2.
All of the control volunteers had donated blood between 2015 and 2018, so it wasn’t possible for them to have developed those T cells as a result of an infection with the novel coronavirus. But all of them did have antibodies to at least one of two human common cold coronaviruses, suggesting that these were so-called memory T cells generated as a result of past cold infections.
A follow-up study published in the journal Science by many of the same scientists further supported the idea that the responding T cells were primarily memory cells, present in the body because of past human cold coronavirus infections.
Other studies have found similar results, typically finding between 20% and 50% of the samples from people who were never exposed to the coronavirus nevertheless have T cells that can recognize the pathogen.
But immunologists don’t yet know what it means for a person to have these preexisting T cells. 
Shane Crotty, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and an author of the Cell and Science papers, explained in an Aug. 11 Twitter thread that T cells might be helpful to some people but are unlikely to contribute to herd immunity.
“We SPECULATE that it is conceivable that these T cells may potentially reduce COVID-19 disease severity, based on things we know about flu and T cells,” he said, emphasizing that there was no data to support this, as it is only a hypothesis, but it was important to keep investigating to find out.
“[E]ven if our most optimistic speculations about crossreactive T cell memory were found to be correct, it would mean that just as many people would get infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fewer would become severely ill and die from COVID-19,” he added. “T cells generally don’t completely prevent infections, they limit disease (make it shorter and/or less serious).”
Crotty also responded on Twitter to Atlas’ Sept. 23 comments at the White House, noting that “several major aspects” of what he said “are wrong.”
“There is no direct evidence that pre-existing T cell immunity affects COVID-19 infections,” he said, noting that he and other researchers “have proven that such T cells exist, but neither we nor anyone else have shown that the pre-existing T cells make COVID-19 better, worse, or no difference.”
“[W]e only SPECULATE that they may impact COVID-19 disease,” he added. “Even IF such a pre-existing T cell immunity exists, it would almost certainly not affect herd immunity.”
Previously, Crotty’s institution also batted down claims about being close to COVID-19 herd immunity. “While many people have T cells that can recognize #SARSCOV2,” the La Jolla Institute wrote in a tweet, “this does not mean they are immune or can’t pass on the disease.”
Other experts agree. 
“There is evidence that people vary in the amount of T cell immunity that they have to SARS-CoV-2 and that this plausibly reflects exposure to other betacoronaviruses over the life course,” said Harvard epidemiologist Bill Hanage in a press call, referring to the sub-group of coronaviruses to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs.
“However, the nature of the immune system is such that it’s by no means obvious what this actually means,” he said. “It could lead to more severe illness, it can lead to milder illness, and so on and so forth.”
Indeed, while the preliminary evidence does not suggest that the cross-reactive T cells are harmful in this case, it is a possibility. Crotty and his La Jolla colleague Alessandro Sette explained in a scientific review that preexisting immunity can sometimes be detrimental, either by making the immune response weaker than it otherwise would have been, or by having the immune system enhance disease.
“Any appeal to existing immunity,” Hanage added, “has to handle the fact that even in places … where we’re still doing relatively large amounts of physical distancing and mask use, infection proceeds at a sort of steady pace, which does indicate that if you’d provide the opportunity for it to transmit more, it will.”
“Any reliance upon existing immunity from other betacoronaviruses, unfortunately, is wishful thinking,” he said.
Crotty and Sette also teamed up with public health scientists from Harvard to think through the ramifications of preexisting T cell immunity for the COVID-19 pandemic. Writing in Nature Reviews Immunology on Oct. 6, the group outlined several scenarios for how cross-reactive T cells might function in individuals and at a population level.
In the most plausible scenarios, the T cells help reduce severity of COVID-19, and in some cases might reduce the spread of the virus, although there is also a chance of increasing spread if the reduced symptoms made the infection harder to identify. But, as the authors write, potential for reduced transmission is already accounted for in models of disease spread since it’s based on real-world data. And again, and because this type of immunity doesn’t prevent infection, it is “not expected to ‘supplement’ herd immunity.”
The researchers did examine a scenario in which herd immunity would be affected, but explain that it is “highly unlikely” and would be immunologically “unprecedented.” In this scenario, the preexisting T cells in the upper respiratory tract would have to quickly block viral replication of the virus, eliminating all the infected cells within a day. This is the closest T cell immunity could get to the “sterilizing immunity” of neutralizing antibodies, which can intervene before any cells are infected.
All the evidence, however, indicates not only that this has never happened before in humans, but also that it doesn’t appear to be happening with COVID-19. This kind of T cell “blitz” has been reported only in animal models with other diseases and with a different type of T cell than what most people have from past coronavirus infections. 
Such a T cell response also has not been observed in past experiments with the cold coronaviruses, the authors write, “making it implausible” that cross-reactive T cells alone could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, the epidemiology also fails to fit with such a scenario, as outbreaks on ships report high levels of viral spread.
“In sum,” the authors write of the plausible scenarios, “the discovery of cross-reactive T cells should not substantially change projections of disease dynamics in populations or, specifically, of the proportion of the population who will become infected before transmission wanes.”
Understanding Seroprevalence
Atlas’ other claim was that Redfield was wrong when he said 90% of the American public remains susceptible to the coronavirus. While there are always caveats to the data, there is no reason to think that Redfield’s estimate, which stems from a CDC seroprevalence study, is wildly off. Such studies estimate how much of the population has developed antibodies using antibody tests.
In fact, another study published in the journal The Lancet two days after Redfield’s testimony also backs a similar figure. That study, performed by researchers at Stanford, found that 9% of people from a nationwide survey of dialysis patients had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Atlas said that one reason the estimate of susceptible people was so high is that the data was old — from March or April. But other CDC data, which are derived from commercial lab surveys, indicate that about 6% of the American population has antibodies to the coronavirus as of early August. And the Stanford study also used more recent data, from July.
As the Stanford authors explain in their article, their estimate based on dialysis patients might overestimate the number of people in the general population exposed to the virus, since many dialysis patients are minorities. Or, it could underestimate the total, perhaps because the dialysis patients are less likely to be working and may be more protected than others. But it’s in line with other seroprevalence surveys, which have concluded that the vast majority of people have not been infected and are unlikely to be immune. 
“In fact, even if the seroprevalence estimates derived from the US dialysis population overestimated true seroprevalence in the overall US adult population, our data nonetheless support that fewer than 10% of the US population has seroconverted as of July, 2020, and herd immunity remains out of reach,” the authors wrote.
Although Atlas argues the percentage of susceptible people should be much lower because of T cell immunity, as we’ve already established, T cell immunity is unlikely to contribute to herd immunity and should not be counted toward the total unless new evidence arises suggesting that it does play a role.
Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an infectious disease specialist and co-author of the Stanford antibody study, told us that the overall consensus is that 9%, with or without T cells contributing, is “very unlikely” to represent herd immunity.
She emphasized that the virus can be brought under control without reaching herd immunity, but that involves using the public health strategies that have been shown to work. “They didn’t need T cells in New Zealand or Taiwan,” she said.
Former CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden also objected to the idea that far more Americans are already immune. “Only at most 1 in 7 Americans have been infected with Covid. That means 6 in 7 are likely still vulnerable,” he said in a Sept. 30 tweet. “The US is nowhere close to herd immunity and anyone suggesting otherwise doesn’t know enough about epidemiology and public health.”

Crotty also responded on Twitter to Atlas’ Sept. 23 comments at the White House, noting that “several major aspects” of what he said “are wrong.”
“There is no direct evidence that pre-existing T cell immunity affects COVID-19 infections,” he said, noting that he and other researchers “have proven that such T cells exist, but neither we nor anyone else have shown that the pre-existing T cells make COVID-19 better, worse, or no difference.”
“[W e only SPECULATE that they may impact COVID-19 disease,” he added. “Any appeal to existing immunity,” Hanage added, “has to handle the fact that even in places … where we’re still doing relatively large amounts of physical distancing and mask use, infection proceeds at a sort of steady pace, which does indicate that if you’d provide the opportunity for it to transmit more, it will.”
“Any reliance upon existing immunity from other betacoronaviruses, unfortunately, is wishful thinking,” he said. And again, and because this type of immunity doesn’t prevent infection, it is “not expected to ‘supplement’ herd immunity.”
The researchers did examine a scenario in which herd immunity would be affected, but explain that it is “highly unlikely” and would be immunologically “unprecedented.” In this scenario, the preexisting T cells in the upper respiratory tract would have to quickly block viral replication of the virus, eliminating all the infected cells within a day. When asked in a Sept. 28 CNN interview whether Atlas was misleading the president, Fauci replied, “Well, yeah, I’m concerned that sometimes things are said that are really taken either out of context or actually incorrect.”
Cross-Reactive T Cells
Paul and Atlas reference studies that suggest a good chunk of people have T cells in their bodies that “cross-react” with SARS-CoV-2, even though they’ve never been exposed to the virus before. Fauci, Sept. 23: Right now, if you look at what’s going on right now, the things that are going on in New York to get their test positivity 1% or less is because they are looking at the guidelines that we have put together from the task force of the four or five things of masks, social distancing, outdoors more than indoors, avoiding crowds and washing hands."
126,"Trump Touts Strong Jobs Report, Flubs Some Facts",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/trump-touts-strong-jobs-report-flubs-some-facts/,,"In a Rose Garden address to comment on a surprisingly strong May jobs report, President Donald Trump continued to repeat false, misleading and exaggerated claims about the economy, the administration’s response to COVID-19, the border wall, veterans programs and trade with China.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on June 5 that the economy had added 2.5 million jobs in May and the unemployment rate had declined 1.4 percentage points to 13.3%. Shortly after the announcement, the president held a press conference, calling it a “very big day for our country” as it seeks to recover from the novel coronavirus that shut down large segments of the U.S. economy.
Below we briefly recount some of his misstatements about the economy and other topics in his remarks.
Economy
Not the “greatest economy”: The president said that prior to the coronavirus pandemic, “We were very strong.” And it’s true that stocks were high (the Dow Jones Industrial Average had a record close at 29,551.42 on Feb. 12), and unemployment was at a 50-year low of 3.5%, as we have written.  
But then the president exaggerated the strength of the U.S. economy by falsely claiming, “We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.”
As we also have reported, the economy has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. The real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product, or GDP, grew 2.3% last year — down from 2.9% in 2018, according to data released on Feb. 27. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times, including under then-President Barack Obama in 2015. 
Manufacturing jobs: Trump also slightly exaggerated the number of manufacturing jobs when he said that “we had up to 600,000 jobs prior to the plague.” At the peak under Trump, the economy added 499,000 manufacturing jobs, as of November 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the number of jobs had plateaued and began to slip even prior to the pandemic.
 As of February, a month before the stay-at-home orders, the U.S. economy had added 483,000 manufacturing jobs — not 600,000 — under Trump. 
“Most people working”: Trump also repeated a meaningless boast that prior to the pandemic, “[w]e had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million. We were never even close to that.” But, as we’ve written, that’s to be expected as the population rises.
There are notable exceptions, such as recessions and now a pandemic, but the number of employed Americans steadily rises with the population. (See the chart below from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.)

A month after the Great Recession started in December 2007, the number of Americans working peaked at 138.4 million in January 2008, before rapidly declining. It took until May 2014 to recover those lost jobs, but then the U.S. again started setting employment records through Obama’s second term and into Trump’s first — until the pandemic.
Also, Trump exaggerated when he said the U.S. prior to the pandemic had “almost 160 million” jobs. The peak occurred in February at 152.5 million jobs, according to BLS. It is currently at 132.9 million.
Employment “equality”: Trump falsely claimed that the May jobs report showed strength across the board. “What we’re announcing today is a tremendous tribute to equality,” he said.
While the unemployment rates declined from April to May for whites (14.2% to 12.4%) and Hispanics (18.9% to 17.6%), the jobless rates ticked up slightly for blacks (16.7% to 16.8%) and Asians (14.5% to 15%).
COVID-19
Coronavirus testing: Trump said the U.S. had conducted “over 20 million or very close” tests for coronavirus infections, adding the misleading boast: “more than anybody in the world.” The U.S. has conducted more tests overall — just under 20 million — but the U.S. also is one of the largest countries in the world. It hasn’t conducted more tests on a per-capita basis.
The president has made this claim numerous times. As of June 4, the U.S. had conducted 19.81 million tests, more than any other country, according to a chart from Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford. But on a per-capita basis — per 1,000 population — several countries still have conducted more testing, including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy, Australia and New Zealand. Another source, Worldometer, a data aggregation website, had the U.S. at number 33 on June 5 in terms of tests per 1 million people among other countries and territories.
Experts also have recommended looking at the number of tests per confirmed case of COVID-19. By that measure, the U.S. also lags behind several other countries.
Stockpile had ventilators: Trump again falsely claimed that his administration inherited a Strategic National Stockpile without ventilators.
“We did not have ventilators when we started,” Trump said about the breathing machines that several states requested from the federal stash in order to treat some patients with COVID-19. “The previous administration left us empty cupboards.”
In a 2017 article, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were about 9,000 ventilators in the stockpile as of at least 2010. And earlier this year, Richard Branson, a respiratory care specialist and professor emertius at the University of Cincinnati, said that, in the 20 years prior to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the government had never distributed ventilators from the U.S. stockpile. Not even during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were ventilators deployed from the stockpile, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Plus, in 2016, the year before Trump was inaugurated, reporters said they saw ventilators during a tour of at least one of the U.S. facilities where the machines and the rest of the stockpile’s massive inventory are stored in the event of a health crisis.
Travel Restrictions
Trump made a number of familiar misstatements about his administration’s travel restrictions on China.
On Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. Under the restrictions, non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks.
Trump, June 5: [W]e could actually close our country, save millions of lives, stop people very early on from China, from coming in, because we stopped early. At the end of January, very early, people coming from China who were infected, coming into our country. That was a very hard decision to make. Nobody, almost nobody wanted me to make it. I would almost say nobody wanted me to make it. But we made that decision. … We saved tens of thousands of lives with that decision.
Impact of the restrictions: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that the U.S. saved “tens of thousands of lives with that decision.” 
Trump has frequently asserted without evidence that the travel restrictions saved lives, with the total escalating over time from “a lot” to “hundreds of thousands.” But as we have reported, we have found no support for such claims, and the White House hasn’t provided any.
The few studies that have been carried out estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of disease but do little to contain them. 
Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us he hasn’t seen any evidence to support the president’s claims. Travel restrictions “can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,” Omer said. But “even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.”
The restrictions weren’t “early”: Trump has often said that he acted “early” in imposing the restrictions, saying in his June 5 remarks that he acted swiftly to “stop people very early on from China.” But, as we have written, 36 countries, including the U.S., had imposed travel restrictions by Feb. 2. 
“What this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,” Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email.
Trump didn’t act on his own: Trump also repeated the claim that “nobody” else wanted him to issue the restrictions. But according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, that isn’t true. 
“The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental,” Azar told reporters on Feb. 7. “These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.”
Immigration
Border wall: Trump touted the progress on construction of southern border fencing, which he said is now “up to 210 miles long.” But as he often does, Trump misleadingly failed to note that the vast majority of that is either secondary fencing or replacement for existing dilapidated fencing. To date, just three miles of fencing has been built where no barriers previously existed. 
“The wall, which you never hear about, is up to 210 miles long,” he said. ”And we’ll have it up to almost 500 miles very early next year. By the end of this year, we’ll be over 400 miles.” 
According to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data, as of May 22, there has been about “194 miles of new primary and secondary border wall system” constructed since Trump took office. It is plausible that between May 22 and June 5, that number has risen to 210 miles, as the president said. But the vast majority of that new construction has been to replace existing fencing. 
According to CBP, 167 of the 194 miles of “new border wall” built as of May 22 was “in place of dilapidated and/or outdated designs.” Another 24 miles was secondary wall, some of it replacing dilapidated designs and some of it where there had not previously been secondary barrier. 
The 194 miles of new fencing built under Trump includes only about “3 miles of new border wall system constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed,” CBP notes. 
But more is coming. According to CBP, funding is in place from fiscal year 2019 and 2020 budgets for construction of hundreds of miles of fencing.
Military Veterans
False Veterans Choice boast: The president repeated a favorite, and wrong, talking point about the Veterans Choice Program, which was created by bipartisan legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama on Aug. 7, 2014. In Trump’s telling, the program was created under his administration — “we got choice approved for the vets,” he claimed — and it’s something people had been “trying to get” for “almost 50 years.”
Again, the legislation was passed in 2014. It allowed veterans to receive care from non-VA health care providers if they were unable to get a timely appointment or faced long travel distances to VA medical facilities. Trump has continued the program. And he has been spreading falsehoods about its origin since 2018, when he wove a tale about how the program was “the greatest idea I think I’ve ever had.”
Misleading VA accountability claim: In Trump’s speeches, he often pairs the falsehood about “choice” with a misleading description of the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, legislation that was indeed enacted during his time in office, in June 2017. The law made it easier for the VA secretary to remove VA staffers; it shortened the firing process and the appeals process. But Trump misleadingly suggested the VA couldn’t fire “bad people” before.
“It’s called VA Accountability, where we can now fire people that don’t treat our vets good. We have sadists, we have thieves, we have a lot of bad people,” he said. As we found when Trump was more explicitly claiming “you couldn’t fire anybody in the VA” before the accountability law, the VA could and did fire people prior to this law. Before Trump took office, the VA had fired more than 2,000 employees each year dating back to 2006, according to data the agency reported to the Office of Personnel Management.
Trade Deficits
China trade: The president continues to exaggerate the trade deficit with China. In discussing trade, Trump said, “We helped rebuild China. We gave them $500 billion a year — how stupid.”
It’s true that the U.S. imported a record $559 billion in Chinese goods and services in 2018, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But the U.S. also exported $178 billion in goods and services to China — for a net trade deficit of about $381 billion, which again is a record but not close to a trade deficit of $500 billion.
Prior to Trump, the highest trade deficit with China in goods and services was nearly $334 billion in 2015, and the 10-year average, from 2007 through 2016, was close to $283 billion, according to the BEA.",Eugene Kiely,2020-06-05 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"But “even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.”
The restrictions weren’t “early”: Trump has often said that he acted “early” in imposing the restrictions, saying in his June 5 remarks that he acted swiftly to “stop people very early on from China.” But, as we have written, 36 countries, including the U.S., had imposed travel restrictions by Feb. 2.

Again, the legislation was passed in 2014."
127,Trump’s False Claim on Coronavirus Harm,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/trumps-false-claim-on-coronavirus-harm/,,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that through May 30, 14% of confirmed coronavirus cases led to hospitalizations — including 2% in intensive care units. But President Donald Trump falsely claimed “99%” of cases “are totally harmless.”
The president, according to his press secretary, was referring to the case fatality rate, and he claimed the amount of testing the U.S. has conducted showed this. The testing actually shows a case fatality rate of 4.5%, but not everyone who has contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has been tested. Some estimates say the fatality rate among those infected is likely around 1%.
Asked whether cases that don’t result in death are “harmless,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: “The president was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this.”
“Some estimates do place the mortality at about 1%,” Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us in an email, noting that we don’t have a solid figure for the total number of people who have been infected. “However, 1% mortality is not the same as ‘99% … totally harmless’. I wish that were true. ‘Totally harmless’ suggests that the infection doesn’t do any harm.”
In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, “including lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don’t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,” Morse said.
Trump made his claim in July 4 remarks at the White House.
“Likewise, testing — there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people,” he said. “By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show, because no other country has testing that we have — not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.”
The president exaggerated the number of tests a bit: 36.3 million had been conducted as of July 3, according to the CDC. The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4.
What those tests show is that 2.8 million people had tested positive for COVID-19 and 122,464 had died in the U.S., as of July 4. That puts the case-fatality rate — the percentage of confirmed cases that resulted in death — at more than 4%.
Trump is also wrong to say these are “results that no other country can show.” Several countries have lower case fatality rates than the U.S.
Among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19 now, the U.S. has the sixth highest case fatality rate — which means 14 other countries have lower rates, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.
And, as we’ve written before, the president is wrong to claim other countries don’t have the same “quality” of tests. Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us in late April there wasn’t any data to support Trump’s claims that the U.S. tests are better than those in other countries. 
Morse said: “Most of our tests for the virus are of very good quality, but quality varies, too, and many tests in other countries use the same methodology and are just as good.” 
Mortality Rates and Disease Severity
“There’s a lot of debate about the infection fatality rate,” Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said in a July 6 press call. “I think the broad consensus in the community is that the infection fatality rate is somewhere between 0.6% and 1%,” but that varies based on whether a population is older or younger.
Jha pointed to a study published in the Lancet on July 6 that used antibody tests to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain. The findings — that about 5% of the population could have been infected — suggest an infection fatality rate of 1.2%, as Jha explained in a Twitter thread.
Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% — at least for now, according to the New York Times.
Jha said he thinks the rate “should come down over time because we’re getting better at treating COVID.”
“And so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,” he said. “But let’s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it’s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.”
Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that’s “still a lot of people,” Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. “I’m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.”
As of July 6, that figure was 130,208 deaths in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins’ figures.
“Whatever the proportion, we’ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,” Morse, at Columbia University, said, “more than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don’t think war could be called ‘99% harmless’.”
McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump’s claim was a reference to “the fact that mortality in this country is very low.” And the case “fatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let’s say, France and Italy.”
The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too.
But McEnany’s explanation doesn’t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are “totally harmless.”
In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: “Overall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died.”
A study published in late February by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly found that 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. The latter category included “respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.”
The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases.
Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said.
And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. “They can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,” Morse said.
Lingering and Long-Term Effects
Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected — and is unlikely to be described as “harmless” by many who are affected.
“We don’t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,” said Harvard’s Jha. “But we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with … lingering symptoms.”
According to the WHO, it takes about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one.
Anecdotally, however, some patients — even those with mild cases — report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches, brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult.
These so-called “long-haulers,” as some call themselves, have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists. One patient in the U.K. told The Atlantic that her case might be “mild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.”
Without more data, it’s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have been reported in the wake of other viral infections, including SARS.
One hypothesis is that the lingering symptoms are the result of the immune system still reacting to the virus, even if infectious virus is long gone from the body.
Experts also have concerns that some proportion of those who survive severe COVID-19 infections may be left with organ damage.
“The amount of lung damage that we’re seeing in a lot of CAT scans make me very worried about functional capacity and long-term lung function in a lot of these people who survive,” Jha said. “And so my best guess — and it is just a guess — is a sizable minority of people who end up getting infected, I don’t know, 10, 20% of people will end up having meaningful long-term clinical effects of this virus.”
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched an observational study in June to investigate the long-term health effects of having been hospitalized with COVID-19, with a special focus on the heart and lungs.
Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about Trump’s “totally harmless” claim on CNN’s “State of the Union” on July 5. Hahn wouldn’t say whether the president was wrong.
“I’m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,” he said. “[W]hat I will say is that we have data in the White House task force. Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.”",Lori Robertson,2020-07-06 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Morse said: “Most of our tests for the virus are of very good quality, but quality varies, too, and many tests in other countries use the same methodology and are just as good.”

Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that’s “still a lot of people,” Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. ‘Totally harmless’ suggests that the infection doesn’t do any harm.”
In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, “including lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don’t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,” Morse said."
128,Aaron Rodgers’ Inaccurate COVID-19 Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-aaron-rodgers-inaccurate-covid-19-claims/,,"Aaron Rodgers, the star quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, made headlines when he contracted COVID-19 and then defended his decision not to get vaccinated with a string of false and misleading claims that fact-checkers have frequently debunked.
The public learned on Nov. 3 that not only did Rodgers have COVID-19, but he also was unvaccinated — despite telling reporters in August that he was “immunized” against COVID-19. When asked if he was vaccinated at a press availability on Aug. 26, Rodgers said, “Yeah, I’ve been immunized. … There’s guys on the team that haven’t been vaccinated. I think it’s a personal decision. I’m not going to judge those guys.”
Because Rodgers had COVID-19 and had not been vaccinated, the three-time NFL MVP had to self-isolate for 10 days before he could play — leaving his team without its star QB in Sunday’s loss to Kansas City.
In a Nov. 5 interview on “The Pat McAfee Show,” Rodgers criticized the NFL protocols and launched a fusillade of inaccurate statements about COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
During the interview, Rodgers drew a distinction between vaccination and immunization, saying that he had not lied about being vaccinated because he had been “immunized” via a homeopathy protocol.
He did not provide details of the protocol, but there is no way to have immunity to the coronavirus without either being previously infected or being vaccinated. Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine for which there is little evidence of effectiveness for any health condition, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.
Four days later, he returned to the show and acknowledged that he “misled some people about my [vaccination] status” — but added, “I stand behind the things that I said.”
“Look, I shared an opinion that is polarizing, I get it, and I misled some people about my status, which I take full responsibility of, those comments,” Rodgers said Nov. 9 on McAfee’s show. “But in the end, I have to stay true to who I am and what I’m about, and I stand behind the things that I said.”
Here we review his statements and what we have written about such claims before.
Unvaccinated More Likely to Contract COVID-19, Have Severe Cases
In the month of August, during which the delta variant accounted for nearly all infections, unvaccinated people were 6.1 times more likely to test positive for infection with the coronavirus and 11.3 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than the fully vaccinated, according to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures. Yet Rodgers falsely claimed: “This idea that it’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated, it’s just a total lie.”
Some data also suggest that vaccinated people who do get breakthrough infections are less likely to transmit the coronavirus than those who are unvaccinated. And having more unvaccinated people in a population leads to more virus transmission. 
“The greater the number of unvaccinated people in a community, the more opportunity germs have to spread. This means outbreaks are more difficult to stem and everyone is at greater risk of exposure — including vaccinated people,” the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia explained in a 2017 article on vaccines.
No Vaccine is 100% Effective
While studies have shown the COVID-19 vaccines in use in the United States are highly effective in preventing symptomatic disease, they are not 100% effective. Some cases, hospitalizations and even deaths are expected among vaccinated individuals. But Rodgers questioned how the vaccines could be “so great” if breakthrough infections are occurring.
“If the vaccine is so great, then how come people are still getting COVID and spreading COVID and, unfortunately, dying from COVID?” he said.
As we said, the data on COVID-19 infections in the U.S. show the risks of getting the disease and dying from it are higher among the unvaccinated. And studies show that while the effectiveness of the vaccines against infection has dropped a bit with the delta variant, the vaccines still offer robust protection. For instance, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late July by U.K. researchers found that the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease against delta.
Ivermectin Not Shown to Be Effective Against COVID-19
Rodgers said he was taking the antiparasitic drug ivermectin, touting a medicine that hasn’t been shown to benefit patients with COVID-19. He wrongly said medicines being tested by Merck and Pfizer were “expensive versions of ivermectin,” suggesting pharmaceutical companies were against using ivermectin because they couldn’t make much profit from it.
“Merck’s coming out with a pill. You know, Pfizer’s coming out with a pill that’s going to help. You know, it’s basically the expensive versions of ivermectin. Why do people hate ivermectin? Not just because [former President Donald] Trump championed it, because it’s a cheap generic. You can’t make any money off of it,” Rodgers said.
As we’ve written, the National Institutes of Health counts over 70 studies on the safety and effectiveness of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 in humans, but the data on the drug hasn’t been conclusive. Multiple large trials are continuing to assess it. Health officials have warned people not to self-medicate and not to ingest ivermectin intended for livestock, which comes in doses that can be toxic for humans. Ivermectin for humans has been approved only to treat some conditions caused by parasites, such as intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, head lice, and skin conditions.
One large, randomized trial didn’t find a benefit to using ivermectin for high-risk nonhospitalized adults, but it did find benefits in the use of another inexpensive drug, the antidepressant fluvoxamine, undercutting Rodgers’ suggestion that profit motives doom cheap medications for COVID-19.
Pfizer and Merck have announced positive trial results for easy-to-take pills to combat the disease, but the antiviral medications are very different from ivermectin, contrary to Rodgers’ false claim, which has been circulating on social media.
And More Unproven Treatments
As we’ve explained, there is no cure for COVID-19, and only a few, evidence-based treatments are available. 
Rodgers said he was taking several medications or vitamins, only one of which is an FDA-authorized treatment for COVID-19. “I’ve been taking monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, zinc, vitamin C and D, HCQ, and I feel pretty incredible,” he said.
Based on the findings of randomized controlled trials, the FDA has authorized the use of several monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 for patients with mild to moderate disease who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19. 
“HCQ” — the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine — hasn’t been found to benefit COVID-19 patients in randomized controlled trials. Studies are ongoing to see if the drug can prevent COVID-19.
There’s no direct evidence that vitamin D can help COVID-19 cases, but scientists are continuing to study it. Experts do advise getting the recommended dietary amount through foods or supplements, whether or not someone is battling the disease. 
There’s insufficient evidence for the National Institutes of Health to recommend either for or against using zinc or vitamin C to treat COVID-19. Long-term use of zinc can be harmful, and the agency advises not to take amounts above the daily dietary allowance outside of a clinical trial.
No Basis For Fertility Worry
Rodgers baselessly cited concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines and fertility as one reason why he remained unvaccinated.
“The next great chapter of my life, I believe, is being a father,” he said. “And to my knowledge, there’s been zero long-term studies around sterility or fertility issues around the vaccines. So that was definitely something I was worried about.”
While it’s true that there haven’t been long-term studies, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines have a negative impact on fertility. Social media has been awash with claims of harm, but there is nothing to support them.
As we wrote after some bogus posts claimed that the vaccines could cause “mass male infertility,” there is no data to back that idea, and in fact, studies to date show that COVID-19 vaccination does not have an effect on sperm.
A June 17 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, found “no significant decreases in any sperm parameter” in healthy men after they received their second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
It’s possible that sperm counts might fall temporarily if a vaccinated person experienced a fever, but that’s not specific to the COVID-19 shots. That could also occur — and to a worse degree — if someone fell ill with the coronavirus.
The CDC has also noted that there is no evidence that any vaccine has a detrimental effect on male or female fertility. Thus, even though a reproductive effect of the vaccines can’t be ruled out, it would be entirely unprecedented and contrary to the existing evidence. The agency recommends that all eligible individuals, including those who are trying to conceive or who want to have a baby in the future, get vaccinated.
‘Best’ Immunity is ‘Hybrid’ Immunity
Twice in his interview with McAfee, Rodgers also made dubious claims about natural immunity.
“I’m gonna have the best immunity possible now, based on the 2.5 million person study from Israel, that the people who get COVID and recover have the most robust immunity,” he said.
Later, he repeated the claim. “There’s a lot to natural immunity. And natural immunity has not been a part of the conversation. But the latest studies — and I have 30 of them that I can go through — talk about how important natural immunity is,” he said. “And actually, if you’ve gotten COVID, and recovered from it, that that’s the best boost to immunity you can have.”
Numerous studies have now demonstrated that immunity following infection is quite strong and appears to be fairly durable for most people (although it’s not a “boost” unless your body has encountered it before). Whether vaccination immunity is inferior or not is still being debated — the evidence is mixed — but it’s clear that natural immunity is not the “best” form of immunity to the coronavirus.
That superlative, as we’ve written, goes to people who’ve been infected and who also have been vaccinated, or what’s sometimes called “hybrid” immunity. The CDC recommends that people who have previously had COVID-19 get vaccinated because it’s not known how long natural immunity lasts and because they can still benefit from vaccination. 
It’s not entirely clear which Israeli study Rodgers was citing, but it could be one that we’ve written about before, since it, too, has been the subject of similar spin on social media. The study, which was posted to a preprint server on Aug. 25 and has not yet been peer-reviewed, looked back in time and found that infections with the highly transmissible delta variant were more likely in people vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than in unvaccinated people who had previously contracted the coronavirus. But importantly, it also found that one dose of the vaccine enhanced protection for infection survivors — a finding that Rodgers ignores.
The study drew on medical records from a health care organization in Israel that includes 2.5 million people, but did not include that many people in the actual analysis.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz also debunked Rodgers’ comments, quoting several Israeli experts who emphasized the importance of getting at least one dose of the vaccine following infection.
Even if natural immunity does turn out to be superior to vaccine-induced immunity, that doesn’t mean people shouldn’t get vaccinated, as the entire point of vaccination is to get immunity without having to get sick. 
As one of the Israeli experts told Haaretz, “It is true that recovering from Covid creates a strong immune response, although it doesn’t last forever, it wanes with time. But the more important thing is that in order to have it, you first need to get sick and survive with no harm.”

129,Trump Ad’s Misleading Use of CNN Interview,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-ads-misleading-use-of-cnn-interview/,,"A Trump campaign ad misleadingly edits a CNN interview to suggest 2 million people would have died from the novel coronavirus were it not for President Donald Trump’s China travel restrictions.
In the one-minute ad, Wolf Blitzer, anchor of CNN’s “The Situation Room,” is heard asking chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, “Is it accurate that if these steps had not been put in place … it could’ve been 2 million people dead here in the United States?” While Blitzer speaks, the ad shows images of an Air China plane and signs saying airline flights had been canceled. “Yes,” Gupta is shown saying.
The impression is that Trump’s travel restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, were responsible for saving those lives.
But the ad edited Blitzer’s question in a misleading way. In fact, during the March 30 interview, Blitzer asked, “Well, is it accurate that if these steps had not been put in place, the stay at home orders, the social distancing orders, as the president said yesterday, it could have been 2 million people dead here in the United States?” The ad gives no hint that the question was about social distancing, not travel restrictions.
And while Gupta ultimately gave a positive response to Blitzer’s question, it is much more nuanced than the ad suggests. Gupta answered, “I mean, you know, these are all models, Wolf. It’s a little tough to say, but, you know, if you talk about something that is spreading, you know, very robustly throughout a community. You know, two to three times more contagious than flu, and up to 10 times, perhaps even more than that, more deadly than flu, then yes. I mean, that’s when you start to get those sorts of numbers. I mean, you know, this is a pathogen that obviously is, can cause a lot of disease and death.”

A lawyer for WarnerMedia, CNN’s parent company, wrote a letter to the Trump campaign asking it to “cease and desist” from airing the ad.
“The advertisement purposely and deceptively edits the clip to imply that Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were crediting the President’s travel ban policy issued in January for saving millions of American lives, when in fact Mr. Blitzer and Dr. Gupta were discussing recently implemented social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders issued by state and local governments,” said the letter written by WarnerMedia Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel Rick McMurtry. “Such misuse of CNN content is false, misleading and deceptive.”
The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh has defended the ad. He told CNN, “No discussion of efforts to prevent American deaths from the coronavirus can be had without the understanding that President Trump restricted travel from China in January. Based on that alone, the ad is accurate.”
The novel coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan, China, late last year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the China travel restrictions on Jan. 31. Trump has frequently referred to the action as a “travel ban,” but as we have written, that is a misnomer.
The policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S. But the rules don’t apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members. And they don’t bar importing goods from China.
A New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect.
Without evidence, in at least two briefings, the president claimed that his travel restrictions “saved tens of thousands” and even “hundreds of thousands of lives.” We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done suggest that travel restrictions several countries enacted slowed the initial spread outside of China but did not contain the virus. Past studies also have found travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
The ad, titled “American Comeback,” also repeats an inaccurate claim on the U.S. economy that Trump has made many times before.
In the ad, Trump says, “We built the greatest economy the world has ever seen, and we’re going to do it again.” This echoes a line Trump used at least 11 times at coronavirus briefings in April: that America had “the greatest economy in the history of the world” before the coronavirus pandemic.  
The economy was in good shape before the coronavirus outbreak, with stocks soaring and unemployment low. But it was by no means the greatest economy in history. As we have written, the economy has gone through many periods of more robust growth than it has under the Trump administration. Over the last 39 years — dating to Ronald Reagan’s presidency — the nation’s real economic growth has reached or exceeded Trump’s peak year of 2.9% 19 times. 
The ad features two Democratic governors praising federal efforts to help the states during the coronavirus pandemic.
In one clip, the ad shows New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying, “What the federal government did was a phenomenal accomplishment.” The clip was edited from the original statement, which came during an April 19 press conference: “Look, what the federal government did working with states, as I just said, was a phenomenal accomplishment.” Cuomo did praise the federal government, along with others, in working to help flatten the curve.
“The federal government stepped up and was a great partner and I’m the first one to say it. We needed help and they were there,” Cuomo went on to say. “State and local governments were fantastic. The hospital system was fantastic. New Yorkers were fantastic. And that is an undeniable fact.”
In another, California Gov. Gavin Newsom says, “Promise made, promise kept.” Newsom made that comment in connection with a shipment the federal government had sent California of 90,000 testing swabs, which Trump had promised in a conversation with Newsom.
Cuomo and Trump, who both come from Queens, have had an up and down relationship during the pandemic. Newsom, formerly a Trump critic, has said many positive things about the president of late. Trump has stressed the importance to him of governors expressing appreciation for his help.
CNN said it learned about the ad on May 1 when it was submitted as part of a campaign ad buy. Television networks routinely review ads to make sure there is no problematic content. The Trump campaign said it is spending “mid-seven figures” on the ad, which is running nationally this week on broadcast and cable outlets. It debuted May 3 before Trump’s Fox News virtual town hall. So far, the campaign has spent nearly $500,000 on the ad, according to Advertising Analytics.
McMurtry’s letter said the cable news outlet contacted the Trump campaign’s ad agency, Harris Sikes Media, asking that the ad be corrected. “CNN was willing to accept the advertisement if the misuse had been corrected,” McMurtry wrote. “Despite this notice, you refused to correct the advertisement and knowingly proceeded with distributing the advertisement as is with the misleading claim.”
To sum up, there is no doubt that the ad edited the exchange between Blitzer and Gupta in a way that was misleading.

130,"Tucker Carlson Misleads on COVID-19 Vaccines, Masks",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-tucker-carlson-misleads-on-covid-19-vaccines-masks/,,"SciCheck Digest
All of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease. Yet Fox News host Tucker Carlson baselessly casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines, because federal officials urge fully vaccinated people to wear masks in public settings. 

Full Story
All of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease. 
In phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are fully vaccinated. In real-world conditions, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in March found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective in preventing infections — not just symptomatic cases.
Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial reported an efficacy of 72% in preventing moderate to severe disease in the U.S. and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease.
The CDC, however, recommends that for now fully vaccinated people should wear masks in public for several reasons, including a stubbornly high rate of infection, concern about variants and the need for more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make unvaccinated people sick.
Notwithstanding the data, Fox News host Tucker Carlson baselessly casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines by claiming “people in charge are acting like it doesn’t work,” citing the fact that President Joe Biden wears a mask even though he has been vaccinated.
Carlson made his remarks April 14 on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” A four-minute segment from that show — which included a chyron that said “Fauci Should Be Able to Answer Simple Questions” — was posted to the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” Facebook page.
Carlson, April 14: Why, for example, does Tony Fauci say you have to wear a mask after you get the vaccine? If we’re following the science, and we sincerely hope to, we’re wondering, is Fauci telling Americans who have been vaccinated or who have been recovered from the coronavirus itself, that they aren’t protected against future infections? Is that why he is saying they can’t eat in restaurants or go to bars? These are not trick questions. They’re the most basic of all questions.
Carlson repeated several versions of the same question over and over, even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has answered this “most basic of all questions.”
As we have written, it is important not to confuse the virus, SARS-CoV-2, with the disease that it causes, COVID-19. The vaccines protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccinated person may not experience symptoms. 
Fauci explained this in a Dec. 10 interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo before the arrival in the U.S. of the first case a SARS-CoV-2 variant. He did so again more recently at a White House briefing on April 12 and at a House oversight committee hearing on April 15.
At the hearing, Fauci said vaccinated people are not expected to show any symptoms and science needs to conduct more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make other unvaccinated people sick.
Fauci, April 15: The vaccine trials that were done that showed the high degree 94%, 95% efficacy, the primary endpoint of the vaccine efficacy was to prevent clinically relevant disease, clinically recognizable disease. What we don’t know right now, but we will know as we gather more information, that you can get infected even though you have been vaccinated and because you are vaccinated have no symptoms and therefore you could have virus in your nasopharynx and you could then transmit it inadvertently to somebody else. You are vaccinated, you are protected, you are not getting sick.
So the wearing of the mask is predominantly, predominantly to prevent you inadvertently infecting someone else even though you are protected from disease by the vaccine. As we learn more and more, which we will, and the evidence gets better and better that a vaccinated person has a much lesser chance of getting infected asymptomatically and even if they do, the virus is very likely very low in the nasopharynx. When those data become clear, the CDC being a science-based organization, will use that scientific data to say, “Now a vaccinated person can actually walk around without a mask.”
Fauci said there is another issue to be concerned about and that is the circulation of coronavirus variants — the first of which was discovered in the U.S. on Jan. 25 in a traveler returning to Minnesota from Brazil.
“We want to make sure that if you have full protection against one type of a virus that a variant might come along that might escape the protection. So if you want full protection and you are out in the community where there’s a lot of virus out there, that’s why we still recommend wearing a mask,” he said. “And in answer to question before, when you get the level of virus really low, all of that is going to go away and you are not going to have any–very, very little risk therefore people will not have to wear a mask.”
This is why both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris wear masks even though they’ve been vaccinated.
As Biden explained in a Dec. 3 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, they’re setting an example for the public. “It is important that we, in fact, the president and the vice president, we set the pattern by wearing masks,” Biden said.
Also before he took office, Biden announced his plan for a “100-day challenge” aimed at slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. It included an appeal for all Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration as well as administering 100 million shots in the same timeframe.
Two weeks ahead of that deadline, more than 200 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S., about 190 million of which were given since Biden took office.
As for the call to wear masks, the first executive order that Biden signed required those on federal property to wear masks. On his second day in office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on public transportation.
We’re still in Biden’s first 100 days, which ends on April 30.
In guidance issued on April 2, the CDC said fully vaccinated people can meet indoors without masks or social distancing with other fully vaccinated people and can have such visits with unvaccinated people who are at low-risk of contracting severe COVID-19 (if the unvaccinated people are from a single household). But the fully vaccinated should wear masks and remain physically distanced from when visiting unvaccinated people from more than one household or in public settings. 
“When you are in the home — you are vaccinated people — or you have a child, and a grandmother, grandfather, whoever it is — as long as they’re in good shape, you don’t have to wear a mask,” Fauci said at the April 12 White House briefing. “But once you go out into that big bad world out there, where there are a lot of infections going on — 80,000 new infections in one day — that there is an issue there that you’ve got to be careful with.”
At the hearing, Fauci directly responded to Carlson’s false implication that vaccines don’t work. “The implication was since you’re asking us to wear masks, the vaccine might not be working,” he said. “My comment to that is that the vaccines were shown, the mRNA vaccines, to be between 94 and 95 percent effective. So my answer to him is merely one of data. Look at the data. The vaccines are highly efficacious and have been shown in the field to be highly effective.”

131,Sanders Twists Trump’s Words on Coronavirus/Work,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/sanders-twists-trumps-words-on-coronavirus-work/,,"Sen. Bernie Sanders wrongly claimed President Donald Trump said if people have symptoms of the new coronavirus infection, “doesn’t matter, go to work.” That’s not what the president said.
Trump was making the point that infections are likely to go unreported by many who may experience only mild symptoms, opt not to go to a doctor and then get better — including some who may continue to go to work. As a result, Trump said, the rate of deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, may appear to be higher because of the unreported cases.
Some may fault Trump for not immediately noting — as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has — that people who experience symptoms are encouraged not to go to work. But Trump was not recommending that people with coronavirus infections go to work.
Sanders’ comments came during a Fox News town hall on March 9 when he was asked to assess Trump’s handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Sanders said the fast-spreading virus — which has now been declared a pandemic — demonstrates why Medicare for All is a good idea.
“You have got millions of people in this country today who may feel that they have a symptom, but you know what? They cannot afford to go to a doctor. And then they are going to go to work,” Sanders said. “We have a president of the United States, you know, ‘Doesn’t matter, go to work.’ We have a president who says absurd things. So, what we need to do is, right now make it clear that all Americans, if you are feeling sick, go to a doctor. It will be paid for. Don’t hesitate to go to the doctor.” (See the 4:05 mark of the video.)
About a minute later, Sanders mocked the president for saying he has a “natural ability” to understand the problem.
“You don’t say stupid things,” Sanders said. “You don’t suggest to people that you can go to work. That’s not what the scientists and what the doctors are saying.”
Sanders isn’t the only one who has characterized Trump’s words this way. For example, Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth tweeted: “As a general rule, you shouldn’t trust what President Trump says. With the coronavirus, it could be dangerous to your health. Don’t go to work if you are sick.”
But Trump never said that sick people should go to work.
Trump made the comments in question in a telephone interview on March 4 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, when the president called the World Health Organization estimate that 3.4% of reported COVID-19 patients worldwide have died “a false number.” As we wrote, that’s not a false number, although experts say Trump has a point that the fatality rate may ultimately be quite a bit less than 3.4%, because the WHO’s rate does not take into account unreported cases. Trump’s point was that there are likely a lot of unreported cases.
Trump, March 4: Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people. So, you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and — or virus. So you just can’t do that. So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California — I believe you had one in New York — you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to — as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don’t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don’t go to the hospital.
Trump did not say that people experiencing symptoms of the virus should go to work. Rather, he was saying that cases will go unreported because many people will not go to a doctor; they will simply allow the illness to take its course and get better.
After some TV commentators criticized the president’s comment, Trump tweeted that he “NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”
To be clear, the CDC has recommended that employers “actively encourage sick employees to stay home.”
According to the CDC, “Employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are recommended to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever (100.4° F [37.8° C] or greater using an oral thermometer), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines (e.g. cough suppressants).”

132,Social Media Posts Misrepresent Old Biden Tweet on Travel Ban,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/12/social-media-posts-misrepresent-old-biden-tweet-on-travel-ban/,,"SciCheck Digest
President Joe Biden restricted travel from eight African nations on Nov. 26 to slow the spread of the omicron variant. Conservative commentators have misleadingly cited a Biden tweet from last year to claim he was critical of “the same travel ban” implemented by then-President Donald Trump. But that tweet was about a Trump immigration order directed at predominantly Muslim countries.

The World Health Organization designated the omicron variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 as a variant of concern on Nov. 26.
On the same day, President Joe Biden issued a policy restricting travel from southern Africa, where scientists first identified the variant. The eight countries affected are Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
Biden called the move, which was intended to slow the spread of the variant to the U.S., a “precautionary measure until we have more information.” However, travel restrictions are most effective if they are implemented before a virus, or variant, has begun to spread. The omicron variant has already started to spread and has now been detected in more than a dozen countries, including the U.S.
Within a day of Biden’s announcement, conservative social media pages had taken aim at the president, but they leveled a criticism that was based on a misrepresentation of a past position Biden had taken on Trump’s immigration policies.
They called Biden a “hypocrite,” highlighting a tweet from Feb. 1, 2020. For example, the Republican Party of Portage County, Ohio, posted the tweet on Facebook with this misleading claim, “And yet he imposes the same travel ban. What a hypocrite!”
The Biden tweet from last year (below) was posted the day after then-President Donald Trump had signed a policy restricting travel from China in an effort to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. But the policy Biden was addressing had nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or public health measures.

Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban. This new “African Ban,” is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed. https://t.co/oePD5eSAWY
— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 2, 2020

In his tweet, Biden was objecting to an expansion of Trump’s controversial ban on certain foreign nationals from largely Muslim countries.
As a candidate, Trump had proposed “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” That 2015 campaign promise, and the resulting policy initiatives aimed at barring Muslims from entering the country that followed, came to be known as the “Muslim ban.”
On Jan. 31, 2020, Trump had added six more countries — Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania — to the existing list of those affected by the travel restrictions, four of them in Africa. Hence, Biden’s reference to a “new ‘African Ban.'”
On the same day that Trump had signed that policy, he had also signed an unrelated measure restricting travelers from China due to the pandemic.
They were two separate and distinct policies. It’s clear which one Biden was referring to because his tweet also included a link to his full statement opposing the restrictions on those coming from Muslim majority countries. It said nothing about China or the pandemic.
This isn’t the first time that the two Trump-era policies signed on the same day have been confused. We wrote in April 2020 about a similar claim misrepresenting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s opposition to the restrictions on those coming from Muslim majority countries as criticism of the pandemic-related travel restriction.
We could find no evidence in the public record at the time of Pelosi’s position on Trump’s pandemic-related restriction.
As for Biden’s position, we’ve written before about a comment he made about “xenophobia” while campaigning in Iowa on Jan. 31, 2020. At that time, he said that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.” He added, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.”
The following day, he wrote on Twitter, “We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fearmongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.”
Trump repeatedly claimed that Biden’s remarks were about the travel restrictions on China.
But Biden did not reference the travel restrictions on China in his remarks, and his campaign said he wasn’t talking about that.
Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfeld, told CNN on April 3, 2020, that his “reference to xenophobia was about Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China.”
She also said that Biden supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.
Biden himself addressed the issue in the final presidential debate: “I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn’t about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.”
Despite this evidence, some high-profile conservative figures still highlighted Biden’s tweet about restrictions on travelers from Muslim majority countries as though it were about pandemic-related travel restrictions. Among those who did so were Rep. Dan Crenshaw, former Arkansas governor and current Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee, commentator Glenn Beck and Trump’s former aide Dan Scavino.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-12-03 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"As a candidate, Trump had proposed “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” That 2015 campaign promise, and the resulting policy initiatives aimed at barring Muslims from entering the country that followed, came to be known as the “Muslim ban.”

133,Biden on the Stump,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/biden-on-the-stump/,,"After months of doing mostly virtual events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden returned to in-person events with small, socially distanced crowds in September. He’s kept up his travel in October.
We reviewed Biden’s speeches on the stump between Oct. 12 and 16. He held six events over three days in swing states: two in Ohio,  two in Florida and two more in Michigan. All combined, he spoke for almost two hours and 46 minutes, or less than 30 minutes per speech. His shortest speech (in Detroit) was about 19 minutes, and his longest (in Cincinnati) was more than 34 minutes.


Here, we’ve compiled his false, misleading or exaggerated claims from those speeches.


(We published a similar story looking at statements made by President Donald Trump during his stump speeches over the same period.) 

Social Security 
In two of his speeches, Biden misleadingly focused on only part of past comments Trump has made about the payroll tax that funds Social Security, as well as only part of a government analysis of hypothetical legislation eliminating that tax.


“We’ve seen his pledge, quote, ‘to terminate the tax dedicated to financing Social Security,’” Biden said in Toledo, Ohio. “You know what the actuary at the Social Security department said? If it goes through … it will actually bankrupt, bankrupt Social Security by the middle of 2023.”

In an Aug. 24 letter, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary said eliminating the Social Security payroll tax without providing an alternative source of funding would deplete the trust fund for retirement benefits by 2023, “with no ability to pay” benefits after that year. But that’s not what Trump has proposed, as we’ve written before.
On multiple occasions in August, the president said if he wins reelection he would look at “ending” or “terminating the payroll tax.” However, White House and Trump campaign officials said the president only wants Congress to forgive a four-month Social Security payroll tax holiday for employees that he authorized that month. Congress could transfer money from the government’s general fund to make up the lost tax revenue, Trump said.
Even when Trump said he was “going to terminate the payroll tax,” as he did in an Aug. 12 press conference, he said the money to pay benefits would instead come from general revenues. In the Aug. 24 letter, the chief actuary said a law with that stipulation would leave the Social Security program “essentially unaffected.” 

One of Biden’s most frequent claims was that if Trump gets his way, and the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act in an upcoming case, protections for more than 100 million people with preexisting health conditions would be jeopardized.

“[I]t’s all about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, which has been an obsession for this president since he became president,” Biden said in Cincinnati. “That’s going to take away preexisting conditions coverage for a hundred-plus million Americans.”

The 100 million figure is an estimate of how many Americans not on Medicare or Medicaid have preexisting conditions. The ACA instituted sweeping protections for those with preexisting conditions, prohibiting insurers in all markets from denying coverage or charging more based on health status. But only those seeking coverage on the individual or nongroup market would immediately be at risk of being denied insurance.


Even without the ACA, employer plans couldn’t deny issuing a policy — and could only decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.

As of 2018, nearly 20 million people, or about 6% of the U.S. population, got coverage on the individual market, where those without employer or public insurance buy plans. 
Health Insurance
Also in Cincinnati, Biden blamed Trump for millions already losing health insurance during the pandemic. “Because of his mishandling the economy and COVID … 10 million people have already lost their employer-based health insurance, 10 million,” Biden said.
As we’ve written, the Urban Institute did estimate that 10.1 million people were expected to lose their employer-based health insurance during the COVID-19 recession. But Biden neglected to mention that study also said that most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million uninsured.

In his Southfield, Michigan, speech, while stressing the need to wear face coverings during the pandemic, Biden said of Trump: “It’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this [mask] will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would.”

As we’ve noted before, 100,000-plus preventable deaths was a projection from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — not the Trump administration. On Sept. 3, IHME said increased face mask use in the U.S. could save 122,000 lives between early September and Jan. 1, 2021. As of Oct. 15, IHME said with almost universal face mask use, 74,000 lives could be saved from then until Feb. 1, 2021.
Also, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield did tell senators in congressional testimony in mid-September that face masks currently “are the most important, powerful public health tool we have” against COVID-19.
“I will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings,” Redfield said. “I have said it, if we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks we would bring this pandemic under control. … We have clear scientific evidence they work and they are our best defense.”
As far as comparing face masks and a vaccine, Redfield didn’t definitively say the former would save more lives — although he said masks may offer more protection. “I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine,” Redfield told the Senate panel.
He later clarified his remarks on Twitter. “I 100% believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a #COVID19 vaccine. A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life,” he wrote. “The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds. #COVID19.”
Misquoting McConnell
As he frequently does, Biden misquoted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s response to Democratic attempts to help cities and states that have lost revenue as a result of the pandemic.
“But you know what Mitch McConnell said recently about helping the states and cities. He said, quote, ‘Let them go bankrupt,’” Biden claimed in his Toledo speech. But, as we’ve written, McConnell said bankruptcy should be a legal option for states facing money woes unrelated to the coronavirus, such as debt due to pension programs.
In an April 22 radio interview, McConnell said: “I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,” when asked about states with budgetary woes predating the pandemic. The Republican senator made clear in subsequent interviews that he was saying bankruptcy should be “an option” to “fix age-old problems” in states “wholly unrelated” to the coronavirus pandemic. “I wasn’t saying they had to take bankruptcy,” he said in an April 27 Fox News Radio interview. “I think it’s just an option to be looked at, that unfortunately states don’t have that option now, cities do.”
Ivy League Presidents
Biden, who graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School, sometimes tells the story that, if elected, he would be the first non-Ivy League president in U.S. history or, as he said more recently, at least the first in 80 or 90 years. But it’s not true.
In Toledo, Biden said he has a “little bit of a chip on my shoulder about guys like him,” referring to Trump, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance. “I read some stories after I got the nomination that quote, ‘If Biden gets elected, he’ll be the first non-Ivy League school graduate to get elected in … 80 or 90 years,’” Biden said. “But folks, since when can someone who went to a state university not be qualified to be president?”
It’s true that the last five presidents earned degrees from Ivy League schools. But Ronald Reagan went to Eureka College. Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy. Richard Nixon graduated from Whittier College and Duke University Law School. If Biden would win, he would be the first non-Ivy League president in 32 years.
Auto Bailout
The Obama administration can claim credit for helping to resuscitate the auto industry after the 2008 economic crisis. However, as we’ve explained, the rescue effort began on Dec. 19, 2008, when then-President George W. Bush announced his administration would provide General Motors and Chrysler with $13.4 billion in loans under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, plus an additional $4 billion to GM after Congress approved releasing the second half of TARP funds. As part of the deal, the automakers were required to come up with a long-term viability plan by March 31, 2009.
The companies’ viability plans were ultimately rejected on March 30, 2009, by Obama, who later announced an agreement on a restructuring plan for Chrysler and GM on April 30 and June 1, respectively. As a result, the automakers filed for bankruptcy, restructured their companies and got more federal assistance. In total, the Treasury Department invested about $80 billion in the auto industry and ended up getting back all but $9.3 billion of that amount.
Beau Biden
In nearly all of his stump speeches, Biden mentioned his late son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015. But in his remarks in Pembroke Pines, Florida, Biden falsely suggested that Beau was the only “foreigner” to have his own monument and highway in Kosovo. 
“My son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year,” Biden said of Beau, who served in the Delaware Army National Guard. “Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system.”
In 2016, the Kosovo government did unveil a statue dedicated to Beau, “who worked in Kosovo after the 1998-99 war ended, helping train local prosecutors and judges for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,” according to Reuters. The country also renamed a highway leading to an American military base after him as well. But he’s not the only American to receive such an honor.
As Time magazine wrote: “The ethnically Albanian and predominantly Muslim statelet at the southern-most tip of what was once Yugoslavia is perhaps the most pro-American country in the world. Its capital, Pristina, has boulevards named for presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (spelled Xhorxh Bush) and a street named for Bob Dole. It also features an 11-foot tall statue of Clinton.” The statue of Clinton was revealed in 2009.
Reuters said: “Clinton, as leader of the NATO alliance, is seen as the man who decided to bomb Serbia to force the late strongman Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, effectively handing victory to the Kosovo Liberation Army.”",D'Angelo Gore,2020-10-22 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“I think it’s just an option to be looked at, that unfortunately states don’t have that option now, cities do.”

134,"Azar, Trump Mislead on FDA’s Hydroxychloroquine Decision",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/azar-trump-mislead-on-fdas-hydroxychloroquine-decision/,,"In a meeting at the White House, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar left the misleading impression that the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to revoke its emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 “removes a potential barrier” and makes it easier to access the drugs. The FDA’s action does the opposite.
Following Azar’s lead, President Donald Trump also falsely accused a journalist of asking a “very inaccurately stated question” about the FDA’s emergency use authorization, or EUA, and continued to point to unscientific anecdotal evidence to insist that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, despite growing evidence to the contrary.
The FDA announced on June 15 that it had revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine because the drugs are “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA,” and that the “known and potential benefits” of the drugs “no longer outweigh” the risks — which can include “serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.”
The FDA had issued the EUA back in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile “when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.”
But accumulating evidence, including a large randomized controlled trial that the agency cited in its decision, has found that hydroxychloroquine does not help hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other trials also indicate that the drug does not prevent the disease if given shortly after exposure to the coronavirus.
The political spin began at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House when a journalist asked Trump to respond to news of the FDA’s revocation. The reporter paraphrased the agency as saying the drugs were “no longer considered reasonable as a useful treatment for COVID.” 
Trump has misleadingly promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential “game changer,” despite its health risks and unproven use as a COVID-19 treatment.
Azar said that the reporter’s question was not “quite accurate” because the FDA’s finding only applied to hospitalized patients. He then proceeded to suggest that revoking the EUA was a good thing because it removes a “significant misunderstanding” that the drug could only be used in a hospital setting.
The secretary stressed that the drug can still be prescribed for off-label use to treat COVID-19, saying the FDA’s decision “actually removes a potential barrier to that.”
Azar, June 15: At this point, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are just like any other approved drug in the United States. They may be used in hospital, they may be used in out-patient, they may be used at home — all subject to a doctor’s prescription. In fact, the FDA’s removal of the emergency use authorization takes away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made people think that somehow it could only be used in a hospital setting. And we’ve tried to make that clear throughout.
It’s a drug. It’s approved in the United States. Has been for decades. If a doctor wishes to prescribe it, working with a patient, they may prescribe it for any purpose that they wish to do so.  And this actually removes a potential barrier to that.
Trump: So it actually un-complicates it —
Azar: It does.
Trump: — in a way. And I think that’s probably — your question was a very inaccurately stated question.
Reporter: No, I didn’t mean to — I didn’t mean to pose it inaccurately. I believe what it said specifically was that it’s no longer reasonable to consider it an appropriate treatment.
Azar: Only in the hospital. It said the data in the hospital setting was not supported. We continue to study in outpatient settings, as well as preventive. That data is not yet in.
While it’s true that the FDA’s decision only pertains to hospitalized patients, the reporter’s phrasing is very similar to that used in the agency’s own revocation letter.
“FDA has concluded that, based on this new information and other information discussed in the attached memorandum, it is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,” wrote FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton.
Rachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor, told us in a phone interview that the “reasonable” language, which both the reporter and the FDA used, is part of the statute governing how the FDA can issue EUAs. 
“One of the things that the FDA has to find when it grants an EUA is that it’s reasonable to believe that the drug in question is effective for the treatment of the condition,” she said. “And so what the FDA is saying now is that based on the weight of the evidence, it’s no longer reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment of COVID.”
In the letter, the agency toggles between statements that are specific to hospitalized patients and others that are more general. For instance, the FDA says that upon a second review of the in vitro studies that first suggested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have an ability to combat the coronavirus, it now believes the suggested doses “are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.”
It also notes that the earlier studies that found the drugs might decrease the amount of virus patients shed “have not been consistently replicated,” and that a randomized controlled trial that more rigorously tested the idea found no difference between the proportion of those taking hydroxychloroquine and those getting the standard of care in testing negative for the virus.
That’s in addition to national guidelines that now do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial, including the National Institutes of Health guidelines, which recommend against the use of the drugs outside of a trial.
Several experts expressed bafflement that Azar — and then Trump — would object to the reporter’s question.
“That’s exactly what the FDA said,” said Dr. Neil Schluger, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Columbia University who has studied hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. “Azar’s being very misleading in that statement.”
“I thought the reporter’s question was perfect,” said Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania with expertise in FDA regulation. “If Azar was doing his job as a public health official, he wouldn’t have chided the reporter for how he asked the question.”
FDA Decision Doesn’t Remove ‘Potential Barrier’
Perhaps more critically, experts balked at Azar’s suggestion that removing the EUA was lifting a “potential barrier” on hydroxychloroquine’s use, when in fact, the move reduces access to the drug by eliminating the option of getting it from the national stockpile.
“He’s somehow implying that the EUA made people think you could only use this to treat COVID-19 for hospitalized patients, and now that they’ve removed the EUA, you could use it to treat COVID patients anywhere,” Schluger said of hydroxychloroquine in a phone interview. “It’s exactly the opposite of that.”
Azar is correct to say that because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are FDA-approved to treat other conditions, including malaria — and in the case of hydroxychloroquine, rheumatoid diseases — they can be prescribed to COVID-19 patients in what’s called off-label prescribing. 
But that has always been true. The EUA never changed that, and the revocation also does not change that.
“The EUA had no impact on whether physicians could prescribe the drug off-label, whether patients could receive it off-label,” said Sachs. “It just made it easier for hospital-based providers to obtain the drug from the stockpile and to administer it to their patients.”
It’s useful to consider exactly what the initial EUA did in the first place. As Fernandez Lynch explained, the goal was to provide a supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile, based on the limited evidence at the time that the drugs might work against the coronavirus.
While chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that can be prescribed off-label, the specific chloroquine tablets donated to the stockpile were not actually FDA-approved for any use. On top of that, interstate commerce laws prevent distribution of drugs for unapproved uses, which meant that both drugs could not be legally dispensed from the national stockpile for COVID-19.
To make that distribution legal, the FDA needed to issue an EUA, which the agency decided to limit to hospitalized patients outside of clinical trials.
Azar’s argument appears to be that that specification confused people, leading some to think that the drug more broadly could only be prescribed to hospitalized patients — and that by revoking the entire EUA, that restriction was lifted.
But Sachs said that line of thinking doesn’t hold water. 
“I certainly have no evidence to support the claim that people believed hydroxychloroquine was only available in the hospital setting, and that now a barrier to its use was removed,” she said. “Sec. Azar’s framing sounds like what the FDA is doing is opening up hydroxychloroquine for broader use. But that’s actually not what’s going on — they’re actually restricting one avenue for its use by withdrawing the EUA.”
Fernandez Lynch agreed, saying it was misleading for Azar to characterize the EUA revocation as a kind of easing on hydroxychloroquine.
“What they did was take away the EUA because the evidence no longer supported the EUA,” she said in a phone interview, adding that it was irresponsible as a public health official not to relay the information that led the FDA to change its mind. “Instead he went ahead and emphasized, do whatever you want under off-label prescribing — we’re going to leave this up to you.”
Contrary to Azar’s suggestion that the FDA was making it easier to get chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outpatients, the agency already came forward in late April to caution against the use of both drugs outside of hospitals or a clinical trial.
Misleading Research Summaries 
During the roundtable, Azar and Trump also gave misleading or incomplete descriptions of the evidence to date about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19.
As he has done in the past, the president — who has claimed to have taken hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 — said he has heard “some great reports” about the drugs and suggested without evidence that the hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine were going to die anyway. 
Trump, June 15: The only place we don’t get necessarily reports are coming out of Alex’s agency or wherever they come from. I don’t understand that, Alex. What is it exactly? Because I have heard — I’ve had so many people that were so thrilled with the results from hydroxy. So, what is that exactly?
Azar: Well, at your direction, we continue to study, especially in earlier phase — so a lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital.
Trump: People that were, like, seriously ill. Like, they weren’t going to make it. “Let’s give them a little hydroxy.” And then they don’t make it. And they say, “Oh, wow, maybe the president was wrong.” All I know is that we’ve had some tremendous reports. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that they think it saved their lives.
As Schluger previously told us, the majority of patients in several hydroxychloroquine studies survived, so it’s not the case that hydroxychloroquine has only been given to deathly ill patients.
It is true, however, that nearly all of the studies have been done in hospitalized patients. 
This includes a large randomized controlled trial in the U.K. called RECOVERY that the FDA cited in its EUA revocation decision. Although the full results have not been published, the trial reported on June 5 that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce the risk of death and also did not shorten the hospital stay or offer beneficial effects on other outcomes.
According to a June 5 press release, 25.7% of the 1,542 hospitalized patients who received hydroxychloroquine died after 28 days, whereas 23.5% of the 3,132 patients who were given usual care died — a difference that was not statistically significant.
The press release concluded that the results “convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.”
From that data, plus other smaller randomized controlled trials and other rigorously performed observational studies, which we have previously reviewed, it does not appear hydroxychloroquine offers any benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
“The science is pretty straightforward on this,” said Schluger. “The data tell a pretty consistent story.”
On June 17, the World Health Organization announced that given the initial findings from its own trial, the results of the RECOVERY trial and a review of the evidence, it was suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity trial, which also was evaluating the drug in hospitalized patients.
What is less clear — and where Trump and Azar may have a point — is that these results don’t necessarily rule out that hydroxychloroquine might still have some effect in milder cases or for COVID-19 prevention.
Some scientists do think it’s plausible that hydroxychloroquine could still work in these instances — even if there isn’t yet any evidence that it does. 
As Nicholas White, a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health and Mahidol University in Thailand, told us in an email, it’s “[m]uch easier to prevent infections growing in the body” than to get “rid of them once they have grown.”
He is helping to run a multinational randomized controlled trial with upwards of 40,000 participants to test whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19 — and is concerned that some governmental decisions, including the FDA’s memo, might make it harder to complete the trials that are necessary to definitively say whether the drugs work or not.
The WHO, notably, also cautioned that its suspension decision should not apply to trials testing hydroxychloroquine’s ability to prevent COVID-19 either before or after exposure, or what is called pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.
Still, Azar didn’t give the whole story when he said that the “data is not yet in” regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat people outside of the hospital or for COVID-19 prevention. While many of these trials are in the works, at least one has reported results — and it, too, failed to identify an effect.
The University of Minnesota published the first post-exposure prophylaxis randomized controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3. In the double-blind trial, more than 800 volunteers were randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within four days of exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly 12% of hydroxychloroquine participants developed a COVID-19-like illness compared with 14.3% of those getting the placebo — a difference that was not significant.
Some scientists argue that more data is needed. They have critiqued the study because it did not confirm COVID-19 infection in the vast majority of people who were exposed and went on to develop the disease — an unavoidable problem, given the lack of testing availability at the time. Others, meanwhile, have found the results largely convincing. 
Schluger called it a “pretty good study,” adding, “it’s a pretty big study — 821 patients — a randomized trial, so that’s a very high standard of evidence.”
Science magazine reported on June 9 that another post-exposure prevention trial, run out of Barcelona, Spain, did not pick up a protective effect of hydroxychloroquine. The trial included more than 2,300 people who were exposed to the coronavirus and found there was no significant difference among those who received hydroxychloroquine versus the standard care in developing COVID-19. The study’s lead investigator told Science that the results had been submitted for publication.
University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware, who led the first published prophylaxis trial, said no studies have reported results yet for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Those studies typically involve high-risk health care workers and have been slower to enroll volunteers.
But he said the results of his university’s trial of hydroxychloroquine in outpatients had been reported to the FDA.
“Investigators from the University of Minnesota conducted a nationwide randomized clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine for early outpatient treatment of COVID-19,” he said in an email, adding that the drug was given within four days of the start of COVID-19 symptoms. “The trial’s final results were shared with FDA on June 11, 2020 as well as with NIH, and the manuscript is presently undergoing scientific peer-review.”
“There are no positive data supporting hydroxychloroquine having a clinical benefit in humans with coronavirus,” said Boulware in response to Azar’s claim that a lot of the “more negative” data was in very ill hospitalized patients. “The FDA is fully aware of what data do exist for earlier phase treatment.”

FDA Decision Doesn’t Remove ‘Potential Barrier’
Perhaps more critically, experts balked at Azar’s suggestion that removing the EUA was lifting a “potential barrier” on hydroxychloroquine’s use, when in fact, the move reduces access to the drug by eliminating the option of getting it from the national stockpile. “The trial’s final results were shared with FDA on June 11, 2020 as well as with NIH, and the manuscript is presently undergoing scientific peer-review.”
“There are no positive data supporting hydroxychloroquine having a clinical benefit in humans with coronavirus,” said Boulware in response to Azar’s claim that a lot of the “more negative” data was in very ill hospitalized patients. Following Azar’s lead, President Donald Trump also falsely accused a journalist of asking a “very inaccurately stated question” about the FDA’s emergency use authorization, or EUA, and continued to point to unscientific anecdotal evidence to insist that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19, despite growing evidence to the contrary. For instance, the FDA says that upon a second review of the in vitro studies that first suggested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have an ability to combat the coronavirus, it now believes the suggested doses “are unlikely to produce an antiviral effect.”
It also notes that the earlier studies that found the drugs might decrease the amount of virus patients shed “have not been consistently replicated,” and that a randomized controlled trial that more rigorously tested the idea found no difference between the proportion of those taking hydroxychloroquine and those getting the standard of care in testing negative for the virus."
135,Wearing Face Mask During Pandemic Doesn’t Affect Concealed Carry Permit,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/wearing-face-mask-during-pandemic-doesnt-affect-concealed-carry-permit/,,"Quick Take
A meme making the bogus claim that wearing a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic “REMOVES YOUR CONCEAL CARRY ability” is spreading widely online. Laws regulating concealed weapons vary by state, but sheriffs in many states have debunked the rumor.
Full Story
Wearing a face mask can curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, but their use has become political. One recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that 83% of liberal Democrats said they usually wear a face mask, while 49% of conservative Republicans said that they do.
So it may not be surprising that the issue has crossed over to another politically divisive topic — gun laws.
Facebook pages and Instagram users are sharing a meme that falsely claims: “Know what else wearing a mask does??? Anyone?? REMOVES YOUR CONCEAL CARRY ability.  That’s right!! Its in the rules. CCW licencees are NOT allowed to wear face coverings while carrying.”
But there are no blanket “rules” that apply to wearing a mask while carrying a concealed weapon. Laws vary by state, and sheriffs across the country have issued statements debunking the claim.
“Concealed carry is a state by state deal,” Warren Eller, chair of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice public administration department, told us by email. “With that said, I can tell you that none of the 8 states I have had permits in have any such rule.”
Provisions related to wearing masks or face coverings “are not necessarily in concealed carry statutes,” Anne Teigen told us by email. She covers state firearms policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those regulations are often found in separate statutes.
The NCSL compiled a list of 18 such state laws, plus one in the District of Columbia. Most of those laws address the use of a face covering during the commission of a crime or to conceal a person’s identity. None of the laws specifically reference someone carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon.
We’ll use North Carolina as an example since, as Eller pointed out, the state’s concealed carry law generated news after Gov. Roy Cooper announced on June 24 that everyone must wear face coverings while in public.
Nowhere in North Carolina’s concealed carry law does it mention the use of face masks or coverings. But an unrelated section of state law does. It’s titled, “Prohibited Secret Societies and Activities,” and when it was passed in 1953 it was referred to as the “anti-Ku Klux Klan statute.”
What’s relevant to the claim made in this meme is that the law specifies:

No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall, while wearing any mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter, be or appear upon any lane, walkway, alley, street, road, highway or other public way in this State.
No person or persons shall in this State, while wearing any mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter, or appear upon or within the public property of any municipality or county of the State, or of the State of North Carolina.
No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall, while wearing a mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, demand entrance or admission, enter or come upon or into, or be upon or in the premises, enclosure or house of any other person in any municipality or county of this State.
No person or persons at least 16 years of age shall while wearing a mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, hold any manner of meeting, or make any demonstration upon the private property of another unless such person or persons shall first obtain from the owner or occupier of the property his or her written permission to do so, which said written permission shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which said property is located before the beginning of such meeting or demonstration.
It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, while wearing a mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, to place or cause to be placed at or in any place in the State any exhibit of any kind whatsoever, with the intention of intimidating any person or persons, or of preventing them from doing any act which is lawful, or of causing them to do any act which is unlawful. For the purposes of this section, the term “exhibit” includes items such as a noose.

No part of that law applies specifically to concealed weapon permit holders. Furthermore, each provision requires that the intent be to “conceal the identity of the wearer.” So the law doesn’t apply to face coverings for medical or public health reasons.
In addition, Cooper signed a bill in May that temporarily amended that law, specifying that those who are “wearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others” are exempt.
At least three North Carolina sheriff’s offices also have publicly clarified that it’s not illegal to wear a COVID-19-related mask while carrying a legally permitted concealed weapon.
As the rumor spread widely online, sheriffs in other states have done the same.
Responding to the broad claim in the meme, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has done research in the area of concealed carry laws, told us by email, “This issue is largely the product of either the paranoid element that exists in part of the American gun community or the malicious element that also exists in part of the gun community that often seeks to divide Americans, which is particularly reprehensible at this stressful time.
“If you are lawfully carrying a concealed weapon, no one will know, so the mask will be a non-issue. If you are wearing a mask to protect your health or that of others, you cannot be prosecuted,” Donohue said. “The only problem that would occur would be if you are trying to conceal your identity to commit a crime, in which case you are a criminal and should be arrested.”
So, while laws vary by state, we were unable to find an example of a regulation that makes it illegal to carry a permitted concealed weapon while wearing a face mask for health reasons. And there is no nationwide rule that would broadly apply to all concealed carry permit holders.
Update, July 15: Readers have contacted us seeking information about the impact of wearing face masks on concealed carry laws in their states. This is what we’ve learned:
Indiana law permits its residents to carry weapons, but there is no law on concealed carry. “Under the law, a mask does not interfere with the ability to carry,” a spokesperson for Gov. Eric Holcomb told us by email on July 2.
Illinois State Police issued this statement after Gov. J. B. Pritzker signed an executive order in April mandating the use of face masks: “The Governor’s Executive Order regarding the wearing of masks or protective facial coverings in public settings during this serious global pandemic was not intended to negatively impact permit holders under the Illinois Concealed Carry Act while legally carrying firearms. The Executive Order does not require or suggest that law enforcement should arrest or criminally charge conceal carry license permit holders for wearing protective masks while in public as long as they are complying with the other provisions of the Illinois Concealed Carry Act and are not committing any other violations of Illinois law.”
Georgia has an anti-mask law similar to North Carolina’s; it was passed in 1951 in response to Ku Klux Klan harassment. Gov. Brian Kemp suspended the law in April with an executive order specifying that the law “shall not apply to any person wearing ‘a mask, hood, or device by which any portion of the face is so hidden, concealed, or covered as to conceal the identity of the wearer’ if that person is wearing such device for the purpose of complying with the guidance of any healthcare agency or to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” Kemp’s press secretary, Cody Hall, confirmed to us by email that wearing a mask due to the COVID-19 pandemic won’t affect the ability to carry a weapon.
Michigan law makes it a misdemeanor to wear “a mask or other device” that conceals a person’s face “for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a crime.” But that’s unrelated to the state’s law on concealed weapons, which says nothing about the use of masks. The sheriff in Roscommon County, Edward Stern, confirmed to FactCheck.org that there is nothing in state law that would prohibit the carrier of a permitted concealed weapon from wearing a face mask for public health reasons. Similarly, the sheriff’s office in Montcalm County posted on Facebook about the issue, saying, “Bottom line-you are not breaking the law if lawfully carrying a concealed weapon and wearing a mask.”
Tennessee has an anti-mask law geared toward stopping hate crimes, similar to the laws in North Carolina and Georgia. Tennessee makes it illegal to “wear a mask or disguise” while intimidating someone from exercising his or her civil rights. But its law on carrying handguns says nothing about wearing a mask. The executive director of the Tennessee Firearms Association confirmed in an interview with a Fox News station in Nashville that it is legal to wear a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and carry a permitted gun in Tennessee.

136,Facebook Post Spreads Bogus Claim About ‘Detox’ After Vaccination,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-facebook-post-spreads-bogus-claim-about-detox-after-vaccination/,,"SciCheck Digest
A vaccination can’t be reversed through any “detox” process, medical experts say. Yet, a social media post is spreading the false claim that a bath with borax can “get rid” of a COVID-19 vaccine. The bath may remove some water from the body, but not the molecules associated with vaccines, a toxicologist told us.
The vaccines approved or authorized for use in the U.S. against COVID-19 are safe and effective, as we’ve reported. (See SciCheck’s articles on those vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,“ “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
For years, however, vaccine opponents have promoted the unfounded claim that vaccines introduce toxins in the body, and that they can be removed through baths, dietary changes or other measures.
With people now getting COVID-19 shots sometimes in accordance with vaccine mandates, the toxicity claims have been given new life, as vaccine opponents direct their attention to ineffective ways of countering the inoculation’s effects.
One “detox bath” recipe making the rounds on Facebook is based on a TikTok video by Carrie Madej, a Georgia internist with a large online following. Although Madej’s video was taken down by TikTok in October, it was shared in the video’s duets — a TikTok resharing feature that allows users to add reactions with the original video — and received thousands of views, according to CrowdTangle analytics.
In her video, Madej offered a list of mostly harmless ingredients — baking soda, Epsom salts and bentonite clay – for detox baths to remove radiation and poisons she falsely claims are in vaccines, NBC News reported. She also recommended adding a cup of borax, a cleaning agent that can irritate skin and eyes, to remove “nanotechnologies,” an apparent reference to what she had previously called a “liquified computing system” inside vaccines.
Madej, who has made other false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, including that they change human DNA, insisted in an Instagram post on Nov. 14 that the detox bath video was not about those shots. “For the record, I have never told anyone we have a detox for the current jabs,” she wrote.


But people are taking Madej’s cocktail and promoting it as a way to counter the COVID-19 vaccine.
One of her followers, Tammy Kelley, posted a photo of the ingredients on her Facebook page and wrote: “This bath detox was shared by Dr Carrie Madej. I researched some of the benefits and these products get rid of bacteria, viruses, fungus, parasites, X-ray radiation, heavy metals and food toxins and more. Recommended for anyone who got Vax’d under pressure and wished they didn’t.” 
The Food and Drug Administration explains that while vaccines contain a variety of active ingredients and other substances, the agency “requires that vaccines undergo a rigorous and extensive development program in the laboratory, as well as in animal studies and human clinical trials, to determine their safety and effectiveness.”
Medical experts say the ingredients used in vaccines are not toxic in the minute doses administered. And, they say, after getting the shot there is nothing that will prevent the vaccine from working.
“Once you’re injected, the  lifesaving vaccination process has already begun. You can’t unring a bell. It’s just not physically possible,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and adjunct professor at the University of Saskatchewan, told NBC News.
And the track record of vaccines speaks for itself: Polio, rubella, measles, whooping cough, rotavirus, mumps, chickenpox and diphtheria, among other diseases, are no longer prevalent in the U.S. because of vaccines.
Removing Water, Not the Vaccine
Dr. Ian Musgrave, a molecular pharmacologist/toxicologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, said proposed, but ineffective, vaccine countermeasures have included drawing blood with a snake bite kit and cupping, which involves the placement of heated cups on the skin to create a partial vacuum next to the body.
“None of the proposed methods will work to remove the vaccines, and may be potentially harmful,” Musgrave said in an email to FactCheck.org. ”All are based on a complete misunderstanding of how vaccines work.”
“By the time a ‘detox’ method is applied, most of the vector particles will have already delivered their loads into the cells,” he said.
Addressing the social media claims, Musgrave said, “borax, Epsom salts, and the like ‘detoxes,’ act by being a hypertonic solution … drawing body water out as your body tries to dilute the concentrated salt solution it is immersed in.”
“But this is the issue: it will remove water, but not large molecules” like those associated with vaccines, he said. “These cannot pass the tissue barriers in your body. If anything, it will concentrate them slightly in your tissues.”
Snake bite kits, Musgrave said, “will not draw out any vaccine, just a little (if any) tissue water and possibly concentrate the vaccine. They don’t work for snakebite, either.”
As for cupping, he said: “This might draw out a little body water but will not remove the vaccine. If anything, it might increase vaccine absorption. Cupping tends to leave large bruises from bursting blood vessels.”",Joseph A.

137,Story Twists Facts on Diagnosing Breakthrough COVID-19 Cases,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-story-twists-facts-on-diagnosing-breakthrough-covid-19-cases/,,"
As part of its efforts to track breakthrough COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently offered public health departments and labs guidance for when to send the federal agency samples from such cases.
The agency defines breakthrough infections as those that occur when someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at least two weeks after they receive their final dose of a vaccine. Specimens from some of those cases are collected so that scientists can sequence the sample, which can identify specific variants of the virus.

A false claim spreading on social media distorts the facts on this issue, wrongly asserting that the CDC has changed COVID-19 testing procedures to no longer count cases among vaccinated people.
The website Zero Hedge — known for spreading misinformation — ran a May 23 story headlined, “Caught Red-Handed: CDC Changes Test Thresholds To Virtually Eliminate New COVID Cases Among Vaxx’d.” It was shared on Facebook more than 13,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
The story was actually republished from a website called off-guardian.org, whose own post garnered more than 2,000 shares on Facebook.
But the claims made in the story rest on a misrepresentation of what the CDC said.
The piece begins by accusing the agency of “altering its practices of data logging and testing for ‘Covid19’ in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy ‘vaccines’ are effective at preventing the alleged disease.”
First of all, as we’ve explained, experts say the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are not gene therapy. While some have made that claim about the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — the vaccines do not modify a person’s genes. A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson also told us in a recent email that “none of these vaccines are defined as a gene therapy.”
And the vaccines have proven to be highly effective in clinical trials — and, so far, in real-world use. For more, see our SciCheck stories on the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines.
The viral story focuses on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests — which have been used to diagnose COVID-19 — and the issue of cycle threshold values. The piece dubiously purports that high cycle threshold values have been responsible for false-positive cases that have helped to cause “an entirely created pandemic narrative.”
As we’ve outlined before, a PCR test works by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. The test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load — meaning more virus is present in the sample — will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles.
There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — “although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint” of a PCR run — Ian Mackay, a virologist in Australia, previously told us.
The central debate among scientists in regards to COVID-19 cases detected at high cycle threshold values (meaning less virus is present) isn’t whether they are false positives, but how to interpret and act on those cases. For example, a sample detected at a cycle threshold of 45 could mean the person already had COVID-19 and is no longer contagious; though, alternatively, it could also mean someone only recently became infected.
The viral story claims that “NOW, and only for fully vaccinated people, the CDC will only accept samples achieved from 28 cycles or fewer. That can only be a deliberate decision in order to decrease the number of ‘breakthrough infections’ being officially recorded.”
That’s not what the CDC has said about a cycle threshold of 28.
Instead, the CDC said samples submitted for genetic sequencing would need to be at that threshold. Scientists use sequencing to decode the genes of the virus to better understand factors such as its spread and evolution.
On its informational page for public health departments and laboratories, the CDC provides instructions for submitting samples to the agency for breakthrough infection monitoring. There, the CDC says: “For cases with a known RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, submit only specimens with Ct value ≤28 to CDC for sequencing. (Sequencing is not feasible with higher Ct values.)”
The threshold doesn’t pertain to deciding whether the test is positive or not.
“The CDC is still counting positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular results with any cycle threshold value as it pertains to case counts,” Matthew Binnicker, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, told us in an email. “However, for sequencing studies, laboratories need a certain amount of the virus’ RNA in a sample for the sequencing to be successful. In other words, if there is a low amount of the viral RNA present, the sequencing will not produce results that can be interpreted.”
CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed told us the same.
Reed said in an email that the “Ct value ≤28 is not used to define whether a specimen is positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. The Ct value cutoff of 28 is only for submitting specimens that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 to CDC for sequencing.”
“Different labs will use different cutoffs for deciding when to perform sequencing. However, the Ct value needed to perform sequencing will not vary by vaccination status,” she added. “In general, CDC uses the same Ct value cutoff for submitting other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance specimens for sequencing. That cutoff is set because at Ct values >28 it becomes increasingly difficult to successfully sequence the specimen because the RNA levels in the specimens are generally too low.”
All Positive COVID-19 Cases Are Counted
The viral story goes on to wrongly say that “being asymptomatic – or having only minor symptoms – will no longer count as a ‘Covid case'” if the person is vaccinated, even if someone tests positive.

The story cites a CDC May 1 update that says the agency “transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause.”
It’s true that the CDC has decided to no longer investigate and report on all breakthrough cases. Instead, it will actively investigate and report on hospitalized or fatal cases, Reed told us. The CDC developed a national database through which state health departments can enter and manage data for such cases.
“As of May 1, 2021 CDC has transitioned from public reporting of all vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and actively investigating hospitalized or fatal cases for clustering by patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type, and SARS-CoV-2 lineage,” Reed said. “Some health departments may continue to report all vaccine breakthrough cases; however, CDC will focus its public reporting on hospitalized and fatal cases.”
The CDC page on breakthrough infection reporting notes: “Data on patients with vaccine breakthrough infection who were hospitalized or died will be updated regularly.” It adds that studies around the country are also being conducted on breakthrough infections, regardless of clinical status, “to supplement the national surveillance.”
But the May 1 change does not mean that positive COVID-19 tests among vaccinated people will “no longer be recorded” as COVID-19 cases, as the story claims.
If someone tests positive for COVID-19, “you are going to be recorded as a case, there is no way around it,” Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer for population health at the University of Washington, told us in a phone interview. “They didn’t change the rules.”
In other words, if someone who is vaccinated tests positive for COVID-19, that case will still be reported in standard COVID-19 case counts. Jade Fulce, another CDC spokeswoman, confirmed that “breakthrough cases are captured in the regular case reporting system.”
That said, Mokdad — who previously worked at the CDC — is among some critics of the agency’s decision to focus only on breakthrough infections that result in hospitalizations or deaths.
By not more closely investigating all breakthrough infections, Mokdad argues, opportunities are missed to more closely understand trends in breakthrough infections — such as the role of specific variants, or whether the infections are occurring following a specific vaccine, in a certain time period or in certain demographics.
He argues that the CDC should conduct regular random sampling among vaccinated people — especially since most asymptomatic breakthrough infections will not be tested and identified — to observe how things change over time and in different populations.
The CDC in a May 25 report said there were 10,262 breakthrough infections reported between Jan. 1 and April 30. About 101 million people were fully vaccinated by April 30.
While that suggests such cases are rare, the agency acknowledged that “the number of reported COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases is likely a substantial undercount of all SARS-CoV-2 infections among fully vaccinated persons.” That’s in part because the data may not be complete and because people with such infections, “especially those who are asymptomatic or who experience mild illness, might not seek testing.”",Angelo Fichera,2021-05-28 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"“Some health departments may continue to report all vaccine breakthrough cases; however, CDC will focus its public reporting on hospitalized and fatal cases.”

138,Republicans Spin NIH Letter About Coronavirus Gain-of-Function Research,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-republicans-spin-nih-letter-about-coronavirus-gain-of-function-research/,,"Republicans say a letter from a National Institutes of Health official is an admission that the agency funded so-called gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses in China, with some falsely linking the work to the pandemic coronavirus. But the research, which the NIH maintains is not gain-of-function, could not have led to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
On Oct. 20, the Republican staff of the House Oversight and Reform Committee released a letter from NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence A. Tabak responding to an inquiry about a grant awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based scientific nonprofit focused on pandemic prevention and conservation.
The grant — which was awarded in 2014 and renewed in 2019 before it was canceled in April 2020 — has been the subject of much controversy. It assessed the potential for bat coronaviruses in China to spillover and infect people and included some experiments mixing and matching elements of different viruses to better understand them. It also involved a collaboration with scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
In the letter, Tabak said EcoHealth Alliance had violated the terms of its grant by not immediately reporting an unexpected experimental result in which mice became sicker when infected with a modified coronavirus.
Republicans were quick to interpret the letter as an admission that the agency had funded gain-of-function research.
In commentary accompanying the shared letter, the committee said on Twitter that the NIH “confirmed today EcoHealth and the WIV conducted GOF research on bat coronaviruses” and that NIH was “lied to” by EcoHealth.
Other conservative media outlets echoed these statements, adding that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, “lied” about the funding.
As we’ll explain, whether or not the experiments count as “gain-of-function” — research in which a virus or other pathogen is modified to become more virulent or infectious to humans — is up for debate. The NIH has said they do not qualify under its criteria and reiterated that position after the release of Tabak’s letter; other experts have expressed a range of views. There is no evidence that Fauci knowingly gave false information or misled anyone.
Some Republicans, however, went further, using the letter to falsely link the NIH-funded research to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an Oct. 21 interview on Fox’s Ingraham Angle, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the ranking member of the committee, erroneously said that the NIH letter “proves all along that this virus was started in the Wuhan lab.” 
The letter does not prove that. In fact, it goes to great lengths to explicitly state the opposite, noting that the viruses used in the experiments are “decades removed from SARS-CoV-2 evolutionarily” and that they “could not have been the source of SARS-CoV-2.”
Previously, other Republicans, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, have at times falsely insinuated that the work could have led to the creation of SARS-CoV-2. Paul got into a heated debate with Fauci in July when both men accused the other of lying.
The falsely suggestive hashtag #FauciLiedPeopleDied also started to appear on Twitter after the letter was posted on the platform.
No Connection to the Pandemic Virus
The EcoHealth Alliance experiments have nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic and did not produce SARS-CoV-2, the NIH says.
“Analysis of published genomic data and other documents from the grantee demonstrate that the naturally occurring bat coronaviruses studied under the NIH grant are genetically far distant from SARS-CoV-2 and could not possibly have caused the COVID-19 pandemic,” NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said in an Oct. 20 statement, referring to an analysis posted to the NIAID’s website. “Any claims to the contrary are demonstrably false.”
The analysis shows that the viruses used in the EcoHealth Alliance experiments share only around 80% of their genomes with SARS-CoV-2 — a huge difference when making these comparisons. 
Much more similar viruses that share 96% to 97% of their genomes with SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. These include BANAL-52, a bat coronavirus found in Laos and reported in September, and RaTG13, a virus sequence collected by the Wuhan Institute of Virology that has also been the subject of much misplaced speculation.
But even these, the analysis explains, are still much too dissimilar to have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.
Setting aside the specific experiments performed with the grant funds, there is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab, and many experts say that it’s virtually impossible for it to have been engineered.
The NIH Letter
In the letter, Tabak describes an alleged grant reporting infraction related to an experiment the agency said was conducted in 2018-2019 and related in a progress report EcoHealth submitted in August 2021.
The experiment, Tabak said, tested whether spike proteins from bat coronaviruses were capable of binding to human ACE2, the receptor that the viruses use to enter cells, in mice.
The experiment is similar to research published in PLOS Pathogens in 2017, which studied two of the same modified viruses. In that paper, researchers used the backbone of WIV1, a bat SARS-like virus reported in 2013, and swapped in the spike proteins of two newly identified bat coronaviruses to see if they, like WIV1, could use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells grown in a petri dish. They could.
This time, the researchers did a similar experiment, but tested the chimeric viruses in mice. Since mice have their own ACE2 receptor, the animals were engineered to express the human form, but were otherwise unchanged.
“In this limited experiment, laboratory mice infected with the SHC014 WIV1 bat coronavirus became sicker than those infected with the WIV1 bat coronavirus,” Tabak wrote. “As sometimes occurs in science, this was an unexpected result of the research, as opposed to something that the researchers set out to do.”
As is shown in section 3.1 of the grant progress report, which was provided to and released by the Republicans on the House committee, infection with the viruses killed some of the mice, with the one chimeric virus being especially lethal. That virus killed six of the eight mice, replicated better than WIV1 in various mouse tissues and caused more pathology in the lung.
Tabak said in his letter that the research plan had been reviewed by the agency before funding, and the agency determined that it did not meet the NIH’s definition of gain-of-function — or what the agency terms research involving enhanced pathogens of pandemic potential — “because these bat coronaviruses had not been shown to infect humans.” It therefore was not subject to review under the Department of Health and Human Services’ framework for enhanced pathogens.
But, he added, “out of an abundance of caution and as an additional layer of oversight,” the agency had outlined criteria in the terms and conditions of the grant award for a secondary review, “such as a requirement that the grantee report immediately a one log increase in growth,” meaning a 10-fold increase in viral growth, to “determine whether the research aims should be re-evaluated or new biosafety measures should be enacted.”
“EcoHealth failed to report this finding right away, as was required by the terms of the grant,” the letter reads. “EcoHealth is being notified that they have five days from today to submit to NIH any and all unpublished data from the experiments and work conducted under this award.”
Tabak then spent the bulk of the letter’s second page explaining that bat coronaviruses used in the experiments “could not have been the source of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic,” as we’ve established.
For its part, EcoHealth disputes NIH’s characterization.
“EcoHealth Alliance is working with the NIH to promptly address what we believe to be a misconception about the grant’s reporting requirements and what the data from our research showed,” said Robert Kessler, the group’s spokesperson, in a statement provided to FactCheck.org. “These data were reported as soon as we were made aware, in our year 4 report in April 2018. NIH reviewed those data and did not indicate that secondary review of our research was required, in fact year 5 funding was allowed to progress without delay.”
The progress report notes that its experiments in mice were “continued” in year 5.
In his statement, Kessler confirmed that the organization’s grant was not ongoing. Collins similarly told CNN that the grant had been suspended “since last year.”
Gain-of-Function Debate
Although Tabak does not say in his letter that the EcoHealth experiment in question was gain-of-function, numerous Republicans interpreted it to be such an admission.
As we’ve written, gain-of-function can refer to a lot of scientific experiments that aim to add a function to a virus or organism that is entirely benign, such as making a viral stock easier to grow to better increase the yield for a vaccine. What is controversial is research that could make viruses or other infectious microbes more dangerous, either by increasing their transmissibility or virulence.
Some people have argued that very little or none of this research should be allowed because it is too risky, while others say the work needs to be done to better prepare for events such as pandemics.
Recognizing the debate, the U.S. government instituted a pause in 2014 on new funding for research that “may be reasonably anticipated” to enhance the transmissibility or virulence of influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses. Three years later, the government lifted the moratorium and unveiled a new framework for making funding decisions for these types of projects on a case-by-case basis.
The framework pertains to funding decisions on “proposed research that is reasonably anticipated to create, transfer, or use” what it calls “enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” or ePPPs. A potential pandemic pathogen, or PPP, is one that is both “likely highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations” and “likely highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans.” An ePPP is a PPP “resulting from the enhancement of the transmissibility and/or virulence of a pathogen.” Even if a virus has the potential to spark a pandemic, it would not be considered “enhanced” if it is found in nature.
This formal definition differs in a few possible respects from what is described in the grant progress report — namely, that the research would need to be expected to produce an ePPP and that the virus in question would have to be “likely highly” virulent and transmissible, specifically in humans.
The NIH argues that the EcoHealth Alliance experiments, although they produced a more virulent virus in mice, did not meet that definition.
“The bat coronaviruses used in this research have not been shown to infect humans, and the experiments were not reasonably expected to increase transmissibility or virulence in humans,” an NIH spokesperson told the New York Times following the release of the letter, adding that the experiments would not have triggered a review.
The NIH says it has only ever greenlighted three projects under its ePPP framework.
It’s worth noting that, as before with their 2017 experiments, the researchers were working with WIV1, a virus that already had the ability to bind to human ACE2, so swapping in spike proteins from other viruses was aimed at replacing a function, not giving the virus a new ability, as King’s College London virologist Stuart Neil has pointed out before.
The NIH also explains on its website that WIV1 “is not known to cause infection in humans but has been shown in the laboratory to infect both human cells and ACE2 transgenic mice, making it an ideal tool to use for these studies.”
We reached out to the NIH for more information but did not receive a reply.
Other experts disagree. Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University who is a vocal critic of gain-of-function research, sided with Republicans about the interpretation of the letter. “NIH corrects untruthful assertions by NIH Director Collins and NIAID Director Fauci that NIH had not funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan,” he wrote on Twitter.
Multiple other experts told the Intercept, which published other similar documents last month after suing the NIH, that the work EcoHealth Alliance was doing would be considered gain-of-function, although one said it wasn’t problematic.
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, told the Intercept that the research clearly was not gain-of-function because it’s not possible to conclude the viruses would be harmful to humans. “You can’t predict that these viruses would be more pathogenic, or even pathogenic at all in people,” she said. “They also did not study transmissibility.”
Still other experts say regardless of the technical definition of gain-of-function, the research described in the progress report strikes them as too risky and raises concerns about the NIH review process.
Fauci has defended himself, responding in an Oct. 24 ABC News interview to claims from Sen. Paul that he “lied” by saying that neither he nor Collins “lied or misled” anyone because he was operating under the framework. “There are people who interpret it that way,” he said, referring to those who view the work as gain-of-function, “but when you look at the framework under which the guidance is, that is not the case.”
Rasmussen said that the committee’s tweet was “wrong” since the letter “clearly states that this wasn’t GOF by the P3CO definition, which for NIH-funded work is the relevant standard,” referring to gain-of-function and the policy framework for handling such research. 
But she also criticized EcoHealth, saying the “lack of transparency & failure to comply with NIH requirements is indefensible.”
Collins pinned blame on EcoHealth as well.
“They messed up here. There’s going to be some consequences for EcoHealth,” he told the Washington Post in an interview.
But he also acknowledged that this new information did not mean anything that happened was risky. Had the group reported its result earlier, he said, “it would not have been a reason to sort of hit the panic button and say my god this is dangerous stuff.”
“In this one instance, they failed to report the results of an experiment that they should have told us about immediately,” Collins also said of EcoHealth Alliance in an interview with CNN. “This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that put human lives at risk.”
Clarification, Nov. 1: We have updated this item to clarify that the 2014 grant awarded to EcoHealth Alliance was renewed in 2019.

139,Danish Study Doesn’t Prove Masks Don’t Work Against the Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/danish-study-doesnt-prove-masks-dont-work-against-the-coronavirus/,,"Q: Did a recent study in Denmark show that face masks are useless for COVID-19?
A: No. The study found that face masks did not have a large protective effect for wearers — not that masks provide no protection at all or don’t offer benefits to others. 

FULL QUESTION
Are masks proven to be useless for COVID-19?
FULL ANSWER
News of the results of a recent randomized controlled trial in Denmark testing a face mask intervention has led some to conclude that masks are ineffective against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. 
But scientists say that’s the wrong takeaway — and even the authors of the study say the results shouldn’t be interpreted to mean masks shouldn’t be worn.
The trial evaluated whether giving free surgical masks to volunteers and recommending their use safeguarded wearers from infection with the coronavirus, in addition to other public health recommendations. The study didn’t identify a statistically significant protective effect for wearers, but the trial was only designed to detect a large effect of 50% or more. And the study didn’t weigh in on the ability of masks to prevent spread of the virus from wearers to others, or what’s known as source control, which is thought to be the primary way that masks work.
As a result, the most that can be said is that this particular study, under the conditions at the time in Denmark, didn’t find that the face mask intervention had a large protective effect for wearers — not that masks provide no protection at all or don’t offer benefits to others. 
Social media posts nevertheless latched onto the study to claim that the trial “proves masks offer NO protection from COVID” or that masks “don’t work,” as several posts claimed. Another post inaccurately described the results as “conclusive,” despite the fact that the authors specifically wrote that their findings were “inconclusive.”
Other articles shared on Facebook failed to provide sufficient context for the study, with one headline from the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity reading, “Your Face Mask Is Not Protecting You.” Yet another from Sharyl Attkisson, who has previously spread misinformation about vaccines, misleadingly states that there was “no statistically significant difference when it comes to wearing a mask or not outside the home to prevent Covid-19 spread.”
Again, the study only assessed the personal protective effect of a mask intervention, not the potential for masks to hamper spread of the virus to others.
The Danish trial, known as the Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection, or DANMASK-19, was published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Nov. 18 along with two editorials to provide more context to the findings.
It’s the first randomized controlled trial involving face masks and COVID-19 to report results. Around 6,000 people who left their homes for at least three hours a day participated, with approximately half being given a box of 50 surgical masks and being told to wear a mask whenever outside of their homes, while the other half was not given masks or such a mask recommendation.
The study was conducted at a time when Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people both groups would encounter were not likely to be masked. Both groups were told to follow national public health guidance, which included physical distancing, avoiding crowds and washing hands.
After a month, 42 people in the mask group, or 1.8%, had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, as measured by at-home finger-prick antibody tests, a positive PCR test result or a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with 53 people, or 2.1%, in the control group.
While fewer people in the masked group became infected — equivalent to an 18% reduction in risk — the difference was not statistically significant, meaning the result may have come about by chance. Given the observed number of infections in each group, the plausible effect of the mask intervention ranged all the way from a 46% decrease in infection to a 23% increase.
It’s this negative result that some have interpreted to mean that masks are ineffective. But that’s not how the authors frame their findings.
Bundgaard, et al.: Our results suggest that the recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others did not reduce, at conventional levels of statistical significance, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mask wearers in a setting where social distancing and other public health measures were in effect, mask recommendations were not among those measures, and community use of masks was uncommon. Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting. It is important to emphasize that this trial did not address the effects of masks as source control or as protection in settings where social distancing and other public health measures are not in effect.
Elsewhere, the authors noted that the data were “compatible” with a less than 50% degree of self-protection and emphasized that their results “should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
University of Hong Kong infectious disease epidemiologist and mask researcher Benjamin Cowling told us he was not surprised by the findings and said it was important to distinguish between an absence of evidence and evidence of absence on the utility of masks.
“In the Danish mask study, their results are consistent with maybe 20% protection conferred by face masks, which is in line with my estimates for influenza,” he said in an email. 
“While some readers seem to conclude from the Danish study that masks are not effective, I would only conclude from the Danish study that masks are not /highly effective/, which we already suspected,” he continued, adding that it does not mean that masks are ineffective. “Even 20% protection would be very valuable when we are trying very hard to slow down COVID transmission as much as we can with a range of public health measures.”
The paper’s lead author, Dr. Henning Bundgaard of the specialty hospital Rigshospitalet and Copenhagen University Hospital, told Forbes much the same.
“Even a small degree of protection is worth using the face masks,” he said, “because you are protecting yourself against a potentially life-threatening disease.”
An accompanying editorial penned by the editor-in-chief of the journal and colleagues explained that while the study suggests that the personal protective effect of masks is “likely to be small,” the study “does not disprove the effectiveness of widespread mask wearing.”
On the contrary, the editorial argues that together with the other existing data in support of masks, the “results of this trial should motivate widespread mask wearing to protect our communities and thereby ourselves while we await more definitive evidence during this pandemic.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an updated scientific brief earlier this month that for the first time emphasized the ability of masks to protect wearers, based on lab studies that find masks can block virus particles and some observational and epidemiology studies.
The other editorial — by experts with the public health initiative Resolve to Save Lives, including former CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden — highlighted several limitations of the study.
For one, the trial was done in April and May when there was relatively little virus circulating in Denmark, which might have made it more difficult to pick up a protective effect of mask wearing.
Not everyone in the mask group followed through on the advice to wear a mask, either, with 46% of people self-reporting that they wore the masks “as recommended”; 47% “predominantly as recommended”; and 7% “not as recommended.”
Most critically, Frieden and colleagues suggested that the antibody tests used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection could have led to a fair number of false positives, especially given the low prevalence of the coronavirus at the time. Even with those false positives evenly distributed between the two groups, that would have biased the result to be negative.
Other scientists at Stanford University and George Washington University previously expressed concern with the study design, including the fact that the study was not large enough to identify protective effects less than a 50% reduction in risk, and the likelihood that any results would be misinterpreted.
The takeaway about masks, then, is still quite similar to the earlier public health advice, which is that people should wear them, but not assume that they will be protected. That means continuing to follow all public health guidelines, including washing hands and staying physically apart from other people whenever possible.

Most critically, Frieden and colleagues suggested that the antibody tests used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection could have led to a fair number of false positives, especially given the low prevalence of the coronavirus at the time. “While some readers seem to conclude from the Danish study that masks are not effective, I would only conclude from the Danish study that masks are not /highly effective/, which we already suspected,” he continued, adding that it does not mean that masks are ineffective. : Our results suggest that the recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others did not reduce, at conventional levels of statistical significance, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mask wearers in a setting where social distancing and other public health measures were in effect, mask recommendations were not among those measures, and community use of masks was uncommon.

140,"Trump, Biden Spin China Travel Restrictions",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-biden-spin-china-travel-restrictions/,,"Both President Donald Trump and leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are spinning the facts on the administration’s coronavirus travel restrictions for those who had been in China.
Trump has repeatedly boasted, as he did on April 4, that “I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country.” On April 1, Trump said that “banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people” was one of the actions his administration took that was “far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.”
On ABC’s “This Week” on April 5, Biden said “45 nations had already moved” to restrict travel from China “before the president moved.” Said Biden, “We started off awfully slow.”
The U.S. did not act “way ahead of anybody else” in imposing travel restrictions from China, as Trump alleges, nor was it late getting into the act compared with other countries around the world, as Biden says.
ThinkGlobalHealth, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, has been tracking the travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19. Its country-by-country analysis of the date and type of travel restrictions shows that in the days after the World Health Organization on Jan. 30 declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, 36 countries imposed travel restrictions, including the U.S., by Feb. 2.
“What this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,” a co-author of the tracker, Samantha Kiernan, a research associate on global health, economics, and development at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us via email.
Dueling Narratives
A day after the WHO decision, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the U.S. for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.
As we have written, Trump was wrong to call the policy a “travel ban” or to claim that he “closed up” all travel between the countries. There were exceptions, including for Americans and their family members and for trade. Trump also has repeatedly and misleadingly cast his decision to impose the travel restrictions as a “bold” move made “against the advice of almost everybody.” Azar said the decision stemmed from “the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.”
Trump has repeatedly claimed that his decision to impose the travel restrictions on China “had Biden calling me xenophobic” and “racist.”
On the day the White House announced the travel restrictions, Biden did say at a campaign event in Iowa that as the pandemic unfolds, Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it.” He added, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.”
The Biden campaign says Biden’s “reference to xenophobia was about Trump’s long record of scapegoating others at a time when the virus was emerging from China,” and that he was not talking about the travel ban.
On April 3, Biden’s campaign said Biden supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.
“Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told CNN. “Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.”
In a coronavirus task force press briefing on April 4, Trump asked if people had seen the “breaking news” that Biden “agreed that [Trump] was correct when I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country.”
On ABC’s “This Week” on April 5, Biden responded that while he agreed with the travel restrictions on China, he didn’t think the president acted with enough “urgency.”
Biden, April 5: You got to go faster than slower. And we started off awfully slow. He indicated that I complimented him on — on dealing with China. Well, you know, 45 nations had already moved to keep — block China’s personnel from being able to come to the United States before the president moved. So, it’s just — it’s about pace. It’s about — it’s about the urgency. And I don’t think there’s been enough of it, urgency.
According to Kiernan, co-creator of the ThinkGlobalHealth tracker on travel restrictions on China, 46 countries and territories (Macau and Hong Kong) imposed travel restrictions on China that came into effect before the United States’ restrictions did. (Although the U.S. announced its travel restrictions on Jan. 31, they did not go into effect until Feb. 2.) Twelve other countries’ travel restrictions against China came into effect on Feb. 2, the same day as the U.S.
Most of those countries’ decisions came in the days immediately after the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, Kiernan said.
“To be fair, the United States was one of the first Western countries to impose any kind of formal travel restriction against China,” Kiernan told us. “With the exceptions of the Czech Republic (suspended visas seven days after U.S. implemented restrictions) and Italy (suspended flights two days before U.S. implemented restrictions), the EU did not impose travel restrictions against China specifically. Australia imposed its entry ban on travelers from China, which was quite similar to the United States’, one day before the United States acted. New Zealand and Israel imposed their travel bans on the same day as the United States.”
In general, she said, the earliest countries to impose travel restrictions against China were Asian and Pacific countries.
“The Marshall Islands, for instance, imposed the earliest travel ban against China on January 24,” Kiernan said. “North Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Macau, Kazakhstan, Micronesia, Laos, Malaysia, etc. all imposed some form of travel restriction against China in January as well. A few African nations imposed travel restrictions against China in January as well, such as Mauritius and Seychelles.”
“Taking this all together, what this data shows is that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China,” Kiernan said.
The United States announced its restrictions the day after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “and those restrictions came into effect two days later. However, to say the United States was one of the first countries to impose an entry ban on travelers from China would be incorrect,” she said. “By my count, roughly twenty countries and territories (Hong Kong) imposed entry bans similar if not more stringent than the U.S. ban prior to the United States imposing its restrictions.”
That contradicts the narratives of both Trump and Biden.

141,"Warren, McEnany and Dueling COVID-19 Numbers",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/warren-mcenany-and-dueling-covid-19-numbers/,,"At a May 12 Senate committee hearing on COVID-19, while questioning National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, “We are right now at … 25,000 new infections a day and 2,000 deaths a day.”
“Right,” Fauci replied.
Later in the day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Warren for using what she called “some funny numbers.”
“Elizabeth Warren erroneously said there were 25,000 new cases today,” McEnany said at a press conference. “In fact, there were less than 20,000. Sen. Warren said there were 2,000 deaths. In fact, there have been less than 1,000.”
McEnany said she had discussed the statistics with Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus task force response coordinator, “and she helped me to correct those numbers, which I’d like to correct here. Because I think it’s unfair to the American people to give inflated case numbers and mortality numbers, because it leads to those same Americans making the decision to not get a mammogram, to not have the cancer screenings they need.”
Warren’s office declined to comment on the issue.
The disparity is largely a matter of semantics. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said “new infections a day,” suggesting totals over a period of time. She used that phrase several times at the hearing. McEnany said “today,” which is much more limited, and “today,” of course, was far from over when Warren was questioning Fauci in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing.
The argument comes as President Donald Trump has encouraged governors to reopen their states and some Democrats have questioned whether it’s too soon to do so. In fact, Warren cited the numbers as she pressed Fauci on whether or not the novel coronavirus had been “contained” and whether the U.S. had enough “robust countermeasures” in place.
As for the daily number of new cases, the rolling three-day average on May 11, the day before Warren asked her question, was 24,276, according to Our World in Data. That’s pretty close to 25,000. On May 10, it was 26,979. In fact, the rolling three-day average was over 25,000 throughout the earlier part of the month except for May 6 and 7, when it was above 23,000. The total was above 30,000 on May 2 and 3.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, there were 17,605 new cases on May 11. But the number of new cases was above 25,000 from May 7 through 9 and from April 28 through May 3, twice surpassing 30,000.

The three-day rolling average for the daily death toll was 1,286 on May 11, according to Our World in Data. But as recently as May 9, just three days before the hearing, that average was above 2,000 — 2,034 — and on May 8 it was 2,245. It was as low as 1,289 on May 5, but it was above 2,000 from April 30 through May 2.
According to the COVID Tracking Project, there were 837 deaths on May 11. There also were fewer than a thousand the day before that. The numbers fluctuated earlier in the month, twice surpassing 2,500, nearing 2,000 on another occasion and falling to 912 on May 3.

142,Posts Misrepresent Data to Falsely Claim Italy Reduced Its COVID-19 Death Count,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-posts-misrepresent-data-to-falsely-claim-italy-reduced-its-covid-19-death-count/,,"
There have been more than 130,000 COVID-19 deaths in Italy from the beginning of the pandemic through Oct. 5, according to the latest in a series of reports from the Italian National Institute of Health. The reports break down the most common comorbidities, or other medical conditions, for those who died with the disease.
A misrepresentation of that report has now filtered through several websites and was recently shared by America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that formed in the summer of 2020 and has spread falsehoods about COVID-19 treatments, public health precautions and vaccines. We’ve written about some of its claims before.
The group’s Facebook page posted a screenshot of one of the websites that misrepresented the Italian report and added this message: “Italy drastically reduced the country’s official Covid-19 death count by over 97%. This means Covid killed fewer people than … an average seasonal flu. 2020. The Year of the Fraud.”
That’s false.
Here’s how the claim evolved:
In February 2020, as Italy was becoming a COVID-19 hotspot, the Italian Ministry of Health issued a requirement that all deaths attributable to COVID-19 be certified by the Italian National Institute of Health, or ISS by its Italian initials. The ISS then created a working group, called the COVID-19 Surveillance Group, to do that. The working group regularly issues reports that examine data on COVID-19 deaths, including the most common comorbidities present in those who died.
The most recent of those reports covers data through Oct. 5. It included information on comorbidities for a sample of patients who died in the hospital, finding that 2.9% of that sample had no other medical conditions before they contracted COVID-19. That’s not surprising. The more health conditions a person has, the higher the risk for developing severe COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained.
But the Italian report was distorted by others.
The managing director for a conservative Italian publication, Il Tempo, referred to that report in an Oct. 21 article that said: “only 2.9% of the deaths registered since the end of February 2020 would be due to Covid 19. So of the 130,468 deaths registered by official statistics at the time of preparation of the new report only 3,783 would be due to the power of the virus itself.”
A British website we’ve written about before then cited that story in a post that claimed, “Turns out 97.1% of deaths hitherto attributed to Covid were not due directly to Covid. According to its latest report on Covid mortality, the Institute says COVID-19 has killed fewer people than the average bout of seasonal flu.”
That website later ran a correction noting, “The author of the piece is effectively stating his opinion that only those who died of Covid without comorbidities (2.9%) should be counted as a Covid death, and then extrapolates from there to suggest that the ‘real’ Covid death toll over the period in question was only 3,783. This is all contrary to the report itself.”
But another website, which has shared other dubious claims about the pandemic, had already cited the post, adding this headline: “Italy’s ‘From Covid’ Death Count Drastically Reduced By Over 97 Percent.”
A screenshot of that headline is what America’s Frontline Doctors shared with its more than 100,000 followers.
But Italy didn’t reduce its COVID-19 death count by “over 97 percent.” As we said, the report included comorbidity data drawn from medical records of 7,910 patients who died in hospitals, and 2.9% represented the share of those people who died with no other illnesses.
As we’ve explained before, those with certain preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, have a heightened risk for severe illness if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
“[T]he presence of chronic diseases in the elderly population is very common,” the ISS said in a statement responding to the claim. “In view of the fact that chronic diseases represent a risk factor for death from COVID-19 and that these are very common in the general population, it is not surprising the high frequency of these conditions in the SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased population.”
For example, according to the ISS report, 66% of those who died had hypertension and 29% had type 2 diabetes. Just over 97% had at least one comorbidity.
In the U.S., 19% of those who have died with COVID-19 had hypertension and 16% had diabetes, according to the CDC.
“It’s pretty rare that someone wouldn’t have at least one issue caused by coronavirus prior to their death,” epidemiologist and science writer Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz explained after a similar claim was promoted by then-President Donald Trump last year. That claim alleged that the CDC had reduced the COVID-19 death toll by 94%, but it was based on the same faulty presentation of data as the current claim about Italy.
“[A]ll it means is that in 94% of cases people who had COVID-19 also developed other issues, or had other problems at the same time,” Meyerowitz-Katz wrote.
In the U.S., the vast majority of deaths that mention COVID-19 on the death certificate list that disease as the underlying cause of death, Jeff Lancashire, spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us when we wrote about last year’s similar claim. That means it was the condition that started the chain of events that resulted in death.
Current data from the CDC show that COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death in more than 90% of cases citing the disease on death certificates, with the remaining death certificates listing it as a contributing cause.
In Italy, COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death in 89% of deaths of people who tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the ISS statement.
So, Italy hasn’t reduced the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19. The claims saying that it has are based on the same kind of misrepresentation of data that we wrote about a year ago.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-11-18 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"This is all contrary to the report itself.”

143,Video Misinterprets Fauci’s Comments on COVID-19 Vaccine,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/01/video-misinterprets-faucis-comments-on-covid-19-vaccine/,,"
A highly viewed Facebook video distorts a CNN interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci to falsely suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S doesn’t “protect you from covid.” The vaccine does protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus; Fauci was simply cautioning that it may not prevent someone from contracting the virus.

A popular video that adds a voiceover to footage from a television interview with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci inaccurately questions the efficacy of one of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S.
“So the vaccine don’t protect you from covid ???” reads the Facebook video post title. In fact, as Fauci explained in the interview, the vaccine does protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which sometimes does not make people sick.
The video, which has racked up more than 468,000 views and 14,000 shares, was posted by TAHO, a group that claims to be a non-governmental organization “to encourage the youth in farming activities.” The group’s Facebook photo includes an image of a map of Africa, and the group is managed by individuals in Ghana and the United Kingdom. Many of its posts, including the Fauci video post, end with the phrase, “African Youth Reflect.”
The video runs about two minutes long and contains a segment of an interview CNN’s Chris Cuomo did with Fauci on Dec. 10. The interview followed news that an independent advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration had voted that the benefits of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outweigh its risks — all but ensuring the agency would greenlight the vaccine. The next day, the FDA followed through and granted the vaccine an emergency use authorization, the first for any COVID-19 vaccine in America.
Another vaccine from the biotech company Moderna went through the same process a week later. That vaccine also protects against disease, but it’s not known yet if it prevents infection.
The clip begins with Cuomo asking Fauci why it will still be necessary to wear a face mask even after a person is vaccinated. Fauci explains this is because while the vaccine does an excellent job at protecting people from falling ill, it might not prevent infection — and initially there will still be a lot of virus circulating in the population.
“You could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected,” he said. “We’re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected.”
Here, a voiceover cuts in to repeat Fauci’s last sentence in a suggestive tone, before allowing him to continue: “We know for sure it’s very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease.”
At this point a voiceover interjects, “Clinically recognizable disease, but not COVID?” The question insinuates that there is something suspicious about what Fauci said, but there isn’t. He’s only making a distinction between disease and infection.
Specifically, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was tested in a phase 3 randomized trial in which people were counted as having COVID-19 if they developed at least one symptom of the disease, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus within four days.
Using this definition, which is quite inclusive, the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults.
Moderna’s vaccine, for which the general results were known at the time of the CNN interview, was similarly effective — 94.1% — based on a COVID-19 case definition of at least two systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills or headache, and one respiratory symptom, along with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.
The trials, however, did not immediately evaluate how well the vaccines were able to prevent infection. This is particularly relevant for COVID-19, because while many people develop at least some symptoms, some proportion of people do not. It therefore remains possible the two-dose shot keeps people healthy — the primary goal for the vaccines — but that vaccinated people can still become infected and unwittingly transmit the virus. Hence, Fauci’s advice, at least for now, to continue to wear a mask and follow public health precautions, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also endorsed.
As we’ve written before, there is a good chance that the authorized COVID-19 shots will help limit transmission to some degree, as that is still common with vaccines that cannot shield against infection but do defend against illness. But it nevertheless remains an open question for the COVID-19 vaccines.
The video misleads again when the voiceover repeats Fauci’s statement that the vaccine protected people against “severe disease” and then asks, “Well, then, what does he call COVID, if that’s not serious?”
That misunderstands COVID-19 and how differently it affects various people. As we’ve already noted, infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not always produce symptoms in people. For most individuals, the symptoms are relatively mild. But in some patients, particularly those who are older or who have certain health conditions, COVID-19 can be deadly — and for others, symptoms can linger.
Fauci was referring to the ability of the vaccine to prevent a severe case of COVID-19. In both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials, severe disease was defined as having confirmed COVID-19 and at least one sign of serious illness, such as a blood oxygen level below 93%, respiratory failure or admission to the intensive care unit.
In the Moderna trial, all 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group at the time of the FDA’s evaluation. One severe case was later identified in the vaccine group. Few volunteers in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial developed severe disease, making it difficult to come to firm conclusions, but as the FDA noted in its briefing, “the case split does suggest protection from severe COVID-19 disease.”",Jessica McDonald,2021-01-26 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“We’re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected.”

144,Instagram Post Distorts Facts on COVID-19 Death Reporting,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/instagram-post-distorts-facts-on-covid-19-death-reporting/,,"An Instagram post falsely claims that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting all pneumonia and influenza deaths as caused by COVID-19. That’s wrong and is based on a misreading of one type of monitoring the agency conducts.

A prominent anti-vaccine activist’s post on Instagram is misinforming users about the COVID-19 death toll by offering a misinterpretation of one way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps tabs on the pandemic.
The post, from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., wrongly claims that the “CDC has officially acknowledged that it has quietly created a new mortality category : PIC, which groups Pneumonia and Influenza and Covid together… and reports them all as Covid deaths.”
“It appears that the new classification gives official imprimatur to a gimmick that CDC adopted early in the pandemic of counting Pneumonia and Influenza deaths as COVID in order to inflate mortality numbers,” Kennedy wrote.
Paired with his claim was a screenshot of part of a CDC web page focused on COVID-19 surveillance that does look at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
But Kennedy’s post — which accrued nearly 10,000 likes before it was deleted and has been re-posted by others on Instagram and Facebook — is wrong.
“[N]owhere on the CDC or NCHS sites does it say that CDC is counting all PIC deaths as COVID-19 deaths,” Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email statement. “This is not true. Only the COVID-19 deaths are counted as COVID-19 deaths.”
He pointed out that the CDC’s provisional death count for COVID-19 distinguishes between deaths attributed to COVID-19 and a category of deaths that includes pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19.
The provisional death data runs on a lag, so the last few weeks’ worth isn’t complete. But, as of an update Dec. 16, the provisional death count reported 276,061 deaths attributed to COVID-19 between Feb. 1 and Dec. 12. That’s compared to 423,212 deaths attributed to either pneumonia, influenza or COVID-19 in that same period.
So Kennedy’s post is wrong that the CDC is simply reporting “them all as Covid deaths.” If that was true, the reported COVID-19 death count would be much higher.
The CDC’s measure at the root of the claim — one that looks at pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 together — is one that has a public health rationale and that is consistent with past practices, experts told us.
The CDC has for years monitored deaths of pneumonia and influenza together as one measure of the flu’s mortality — as archived CDC pages, such as one from January 2016, show. Influenza can cause pneumonia, and so can the novel coronavirus.
“The PIC category was created as a surveillance indicator to monitor COVID-19 mortality, in the same way that we have used combined pneumonia and influenza deaths, for many years, to monitor influenza mortality,” Anderson said. “Pneumonia tends to fluctuate in response to and along with influenza (and COVID-19). This is particularly useful where influenza (or COVID-19) mortality is underreported.”
Alex Washburne, a researcher who has studied the prevalence of the novel coronavirus by analyzing data on influenza-like illnesses, told us in an email that the “CDC’s mortality surveillance is a kind of ‘syndromic surveillance’ similar to their influenza-like illness surveillance, and it’s a way to obtain very useful glimpses of disease burden from a somewhat clunky US health system.”
It makes sense that public health officials would use this surveillance as one way to monitor the pandemic, since there are several diagnosis codes that a doctor may use for a patient with COVID-19 symptoms — especially if a test result isn’t available — said Washburne, now chief scientist and epidemiological consultant at Selva Analytics. For example, a patient might be recorded as having “pneumonia of unknown cause.”
Washburne also said the PIC category “is a useful dataset for disease burden due to respiratory pathogens, which itself is likely a useful category for understanding disease control & prevention (e.g. social distancing and mask-wearing may affect many respiratory pathogens).”
Dr. Justin Silverman, a Penn State assistant professor in the College of Information Science and Technology and assistant professor of medicine who co-authored the aforementioned study with Washburne, agreed. He told us in a phone interview that the PIC metric could be useful for multiple reasons, including “to get a sense of, are we missing COVID deaths?”
But, Silverman said, “no one’s being misled, it’s incredibly obvious” — noting that the CDC’s references to the PIC count are clearly labeled as such.",Angelo Fichera,2020-12-16 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"He told us in a phone interview that the PIC metric could be useful for multiple reasons, including “to get a sense of, are we missing COVID deaths?”
But, Silverman said, “no one’s being misled, it’s incredibly obvious” — noting that the CDC’s references to the PIC count are clearly labeled as such. The post, from Robert F.

“It appears that the new classification gives official imprimatur to a gimmick that CDC adopted early in the pandemic of counting Pneumonia and Influenza deaths as COVID in order to inflate mortality numbers,” Kennedy wrote. “The PIC category was created as a surveillance indicator to monitor COVID-19 mortality, in the same way that we have used combined pneumonia and influenza deaths, for many years, to monitor influenza mortality,” Anderson said. “[N owhere on the CDC or NCHS sites does it say that CDC is counting all PIC deaths as COVID-19 deaths,” Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email statement.

145,Irish Professor Makes Unfounded Claims About Long-Term Effects of mRNA Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-irish-professor-makes-unfounded-claims-about-long-term-effects-of-mrna-vaccines/,,"
Update, Aug. 23: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.
The mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 represent a new vaccine platform, but their development rests on years’ worth of research, including clinical trials. And while the vaccines were developed quickly in response to the pandemic, they have been proven to be safe and effective not only in standard clinical trials but in real-world conditions.
The vaccines in question use modified messenger RNA to provide instructions for cells to make spike proteins that then trigger an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The cells quickly break down the mRNA.
But as the vaccines are deployed around the country, some have weaponized their novelty to spread misinformation and unfounded claims about their safety.

In one case, a video clip circulating online shows Dolores Cahill — a professor in Ireland who until recently was the chair of the right-wing Irish Freedom Party — baselessly claiming that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines will cause widespread deaths in the coming years.
Cahill specifically alleges that “anyone who’s over 70 who gets one of these mRNA vaccines will probably be — sadly die within about two to three years.”
“And I would say anyone who gets the mRNA injection, no matter what age you are, your life expectancy will be reduced to you know die, if you’re in your 30s, within five to 10 years,” continues Cahill, a professor at the medical school at the University College Dublin who has previously come under criticism for spreading misinformation about COVID-19.
There is no medical evidence for such claims.
In phase 3 trials, the two mRNA vaccines authorized in the U.S. — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — had an efficacy of 94% or higher, which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are fully vaccinated. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in March found that, in real-world conditions, the two vaccines were 90% effective in preventing infections. (For more, see our SciCheck stories “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
The video clip of Cahill has been repeatedly posted and viewed by tens of thousands on platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and Telegram and is branded as coming from a group called the “World Freedom Alliance,” which Cahill helped found in November. In a video announcing the group’s formation, one member referred to COVID-19 as a “hoax”; Cahill said the group would “expose the truth of what’s going on” in order to protect freedoms.
The clip now spreading online is taken from a speaking event in Belfast in March. The full video shows Cahill making a host of other erroneous claims, including that the vaccines “contain nanoparticles and you can be tracked.” The nanoparticles (a unit of size) referenced are actually lipid nanoparticles, material that helps to protect and transport the mRNA to the cell; they are not part of a technology that can track people.
We’ll address some of Cahill’s unsubstantiated claims in the viral clip here.
Unfounded Claim of Future Deaths
It’s unclear what exactly is behind Cahill’s wild and baseless claim that the vaccines will cause all recipients to die within a matter of years. Our inquiries to Cahill went unanswered.
Meanwhile, Grant McFadden, director of the Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines, and Virotherapy at Arizona State University, told us in an email that “the safety record for the mRNA vaccines is excellent.”
McFadden said that while “we do not yet have long-term data in humans,” there “are no scientific reasons to predict complications in these new vaccines in the coming years.” He added that “common health practices mandate that this will be monitored carefully for years to come.”
In a different video uploaded earlier this year, Cahill also predicts widespread deaths specifically from the mRNA vaccines by misrepresenting old studies unrelated to the mRNA technology.
In one case, she cites a 2012 study dealing with vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV (the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003).
“What happened in this study is that the animal models after [they] have been challenged got very sick and that some of them died,” Cahill says.
As we noted in a previous story, those vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV were not mRNA vaccines, as Cahill implies. And while the study found that the vaccine candidates being tested caused mice to develop eosinophilia — a high count of a type of white blood cells — when exposed to the live virus, the animals didn’t die, as our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters have explained.
Moreover, that phenomenon, in which a vaccine can lead to worse disease when confronted with a live virus, was not observed in the animal or human trials for the COVID-19 vaccines that received emergency use authorizations.
Cahill in the earlier video similarly references another vaccine trial against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. That trial, from the 1960s, also did not involve an mRNA vaccine, as she suggests.
“Most of the children who were given this RSV vaccine, which had the same issue, most of the children experienced severe disease with infection that led to a high frequency of hospitalizations — and two children out of 35 died,” she says. “And the conclusion from this was that the disease was enhanced by the prior vaccination.”
“What people need to know is that with these RNA vaccines is that after you’re vaccinated, for the rest of your life, you will have much higher death as the children did with this study because you were vaccinated,” she adds.
That case actually involved a formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate. Researchers did find that the design of the vaccine candidate resulted in poorly developed antibodies and that the immunized children who still caught RSV suffered worse symptoms than usual. Two children who were part of the trial died as a result of the enhanced disease; the trial stopped and no RSV vaccine has been approved.
But again, this type of phenomenon has not been seen with the COVID-19 vaccines granted emergency use authorization in the U.S.
“Neither COVID-19 disease nor the new COVID-19 vaccines have shown evidence of causing [antibody-dependent enhancement],” the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia reports. “People infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have not been likely to develop ADE upon repeat exposure.”
Some scientists who noted the possibility of this issue occurring, as COVID-19 vaccine development was underway, have since said subsequent data helped to quell those concerns.
Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of Baylor College of Medicine’s National School of Tropical Medicine, said in an email to us that he was among the scientists who flagged the need for researchers “to be on the lookout for immune enhancement” — including in testimony before the House in March 2020 — “based on our work on SARS 1 in rodent models last decade.”
“But as we and others started doing non human primate vaccine trials for SARS 2 it never materialized,” Hotez, also co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said. “That’s why we do the science.”
Other Baseless Risk Claims
Many vaccine recipients experience pain at the site of injection, fatigue, muscle pain or headache, as we’ve explained. Data from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials also show the side effects included joint pain, chills or fever.
A small number of people in the U.S. have had serious allergic reactions following receipt of the shots. That’s why the CDC advises that anyone who has previously experienced anaphylaxis or had any kind of immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injection be monitored for a half hour after getting the shot. (The FDA also recommends against vaccination for those who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one of the ingredients of any of the authorized vaccines.)
In the video clip circulating online, though, Cahill suggests without evidence that recipients will go on to “probably have allergy, neuro-cognitive issues, and inflammation, and of course infertility is the major one.”
We’ve previously addressed the lack of evidence for the claim that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility. While clinical trials did not probe the issue, loss of fertility has not been reported among thousands of trial participants and it has not been confirmed as an adverse event among the millions who have been vaccinated.
And as for the other supposed long-term effects, Hotez said “there is zero evidence to support such claims.”
“Also there is not even a plausible mechanism, it’s just antivax gobbledygook,” he said.
While Cahill’s claims about supposed long-term effects of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines aren’t rooted in evidence, there is support for the fact that COVID-19 itself can result in long-term health effects.
Hotez pointed out that some who contract COVID-19 suffer from what’s known as long-haul COVID and continue to report health issues well after being infected. Among such issues, researchers have found that some such patients continue to experience neurological or psychiatric conditions in the months following infection.",Angelo Fichera,2021-04-21 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Cahill specifically alleges that “anyone who’s over 70 who gets one of these mRNA vaccines will probably be — sadly die within about two to three years.”

146,The Wuhan Lab and the Gain-of-Function Disagreement,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/the-wuhan-lab-and-the-gain-of-function-disagreement/,,"A disagreement between Republican Sen. Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci has put $600,000 of U.S. grant money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology back into the spotlight, while making “gain-of-function” research a household term — all amid calls for more investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2.
At issue is whether the National Institutes of Health funded research on bat coronaviruses that could have caused a pathogen to become more infectious to humans and, separately, if SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 — transferred naturally from bats to humans, possibly through an intermediate host animal, or if a virus, a naturally occurring one or a lab-enhanced one, was accidentally released from the Wuhan lab.
There are a lot of unknowns, speculation and differences of opinion on these topics. But let’s start with what we do know: In 2014, the NIH awarded a grant to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats. In 2019, the project was renewed for another five years, but it was canceled in April 2020 — three months after the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S.
EcoHealth ultimately received $3.7 million over six years from the NIH and distributed nearly $600,000 of that total to China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, a collaborator on the project, pre-approved by NIH.
The grant cancellation came at a time when then-President Donald Trump and others questioned the U.S. funding to a lab in Wuhan, while exaggerating the amount of federal money involved.
Wuhan, of course, is where the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic emerged in late 2019.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has studied bat coronaviruses for years and their potential to ultimately infect humans, under the direction of scientist Shi Zhengli, as the Scientific American explained in a June 2020 story. Such zoonotic transfer — meaning transmission of a virus from an animal to a human — of coronaviruses occurred with the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, which led to global outbreaks in 2003 and 2012. Both viruses are thought to have started in bats, and then transferred into humans through intermediate animals — civets and racoon dogs, in the case of SARS, and camels in the case of MERS.
Experts have suspected the SARS-CoV-2 virus similarly originated in bats. Researchers in China — including at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — have said the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus collected by researchers in 2013 in Yunnan Province, China. (While that’s quite similar, Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses and a pediatric infectious disease physician, told us it would be “impossible” to take such a virus and make the kind of changes required to turn it into SARS-CoV-2 in a lab. One would need a virus that’s 99.9% similar, and “in theory it might work.”) 
An article published in Nature Medicine in March 2020 said that the virus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” The researchers, who analyzed genomic data, said SARS-CoV-2 “is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” While they said an accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus can’t be ruled out, they said they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”
In an April 2020 statement, University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of SARS-CoV-2, responded to “unfounded speculation” that the bat virus with 96% similarity was the origin of SARS-CoV-2. He said: “In summary, the abundance, diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife strongly suggests that this virus is of natural origin. However, a greater sampling of animal species in nature, including bats from Hubei province, is needed to resolve the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2.”
The U.S. Intelligence Community said in an April 30, 2020, statement that it “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,” and that it “will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”
The zoonotic transfer theory hasn’t been proven; for example, no intermediate animal host, as was the case for SARS of MERS, has yet been identified. Lab-accident theories haven’t been proven either — whether a lab worker could have been infected by a naturally occurring virus and then transmitted it outside the lab, or, as Paul and others suggest, a lab-manipulated virus could be the origin.
But recently there has been renewed debate over the origin. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for “more investigation” to determine how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began. “Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,” they wrote. “Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.”
Jesse Bloom, one of the organizers of that letter, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, told us in an email: “We know that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that circulate in bats, so the deep origins of the virus are definitely from bat coronaviruses. As far as the immediate proximal origins, we simply don’t know the details.”
Bloom said zoonotic transfer either directly from a bat to a human or through an intermediate host animal is possible, as is a lab accident from research of similar viruses. “Because we don’t know the details for either of these scenarios, it’s not possible to say whether a hypothetical lab accident would have involved a virus exactly identical to that isolated in nature, or one that had been grown or somehow modestly manipulated in a lab. At this point, all of these are hypothetical scenarios, and while different scientists may have different guesses at how likely each scenario is, we need more information before anyone can be certain.”
The scientists are hardly alone in calling for more investigation.
As the letter noted, the U.S. government, along with 13 other countries, also had called for more inquiry into the origins in a March statement this year.
“It is critical for independent experts to have full access to all pertinent human, animal, and environmental data, research, and personnel involved in the early stages of the outbreak relevant to determining how this pandemic emerged,” the statement said. “With all data in hand, the international community may independently assess COVID-19 origins, learn valuable lessons from this pandemic, and prevent future devastating consequences from outbreaks of disease.”
The European Union made a similar statement. Both came in response to the release of a report by an international team convened by the World Health Organization. That report said a laboratory leak of a virus, involving “an accidental infection of staff,” was “an extremely unlikely pathway,” but the WHO director-general said that he didn’t believe the evaluation “was extensive enough.”
“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the day the report was publicly released on March 30. “Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table.”
In a May 11 Senate hearing, Paul raised the issue of the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and said some in the government weren’t interested in investigating the lab-leak theory. The Kentucky senator said that “government authorities, self-interested in continuing gain-of-function research say there’s nothing to see here.” He went on to assert a tie between U.S. researchers and the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused them of “juicing up super-viruses,” asking Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, if he still supported “the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan.”
Fauci responded that “the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”
In a subsequent interview on “Fox & Friends” on May 13, Paul said he didn’t know whether SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab. “Nobody knows,” he said. But he posited that if it did, Fauci, among others, “could be culpable for the entire pandemic,” adding, “I’m not saying that happened. I don’t know.”
Paul made the money-is-fungible argument, saying the NIH gave money to the lab, regardless of what that particular grant funded. But then asserted that NIH funding furthered risky gain-of-function research. The answer to the question of whether it did or didn’t depends on whom you ask and their definition of gain-of-function.
Hours after his May 11 exchange with Paul, Fauci said at a fact-checking conference hosted by PolitiFact.com that it would “almost be irresponsible” to not collaborate with Chinese scientists given that the 2003 SARS outbreak originated in China. “So we really had to learn a lot more about the viruses that were there, about whether or not people were getting infected with bad viruses.”
He called the EcoHealth collaboration “a very minor collaboration as part of a subcontract of a grant,” and said Paul conflated that with the claim that “therefore we were involved in creating the virus, which is the most ridiculous, majestic leap I’ve ever heard of.”
Fauci said he wasn’t convinced that the coronavirus developed naturally. “I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened.”
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson raised these issues on his show on May 11, saying: “The guy in charge of America’s response to COVID turns out to be the guy who funded the creation of COVID. We’re speaking of Tony Fauci and the gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan laboratory that the U.S. government with his approval paid for.” There’s no evidence that the Wuhan laboratory, with or without funding from an NIH grant, created SARS-CoV-2.
The night before, Carlson referred to a May 2 article on Medium by former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade. In that piece, Wade wrote about “two main theories” of SARS-Co-V-2’s origin: “One is that it jumped naturally from wildlife to people. The other is that the virus was under study in a lab, from which it escaped.” Wade asserted that the “clues point in a specific direction” — a lab-leak. But he said at the outset: “It’s important to note that so far there is no direct evidence for either theory. Each depends on a set of reasonable conjectures but so far lacks proof.”
Gain-of-Function
Gain-of-function is a term that could describe any type of virology research that results in the gain of a certain function. But the type that’s controversial, including among scientists, is research that causes a pathogen to be more infectious, particularly to humans.
In 2014, the U.S. government put a pause on new funding of gain-of-function research, which it defined this way: “With an ultimate goal of better understanding disease pathways, gain-of-function studies aim to increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by enhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility.” A 2016 paper on the ethics of gain-of-function research said: “The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures.”
The pause — intended to provide time to address concerns about the risks and benefits of these studies — applied to certain research on influenza, MERS and SARS.
“Specifically, the funding pause will apply to gain-of-function research projects that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route,” the White House said in an Oct. 17, 2014, announcement.
As a Nature article at the time explained, there had been fierce debate among scientists on exactly what research should be deemed too risky. And some confusion on where the line would be drawn for this pause.
“Viruses are always mutating,” the article said, “and [Arturo] Casadevall [then a microbiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City], says that it is difficult to determine how much mutation deliberately created by scientists might be ‘reasonably anticipated’ to make a virus more dangerous — the point at which the White House states research must stop.”
In July 2014, a group of scientists and experts called the Cambridge Working Group issued a statement calling for such a pause of “[e]xperiments involving the creation of potential pandemic pathogens … until there has been a quantitative, objective and credible assessment of the risks, potential benefits, and opportunities for risk mitigation, as well as comparison against safer experimental approaches.”
Well over 300 scientists have since signed on to the statement, which expressed concern about the risk of accidental infection in lab studies that created “highly transmissible, novel strains of dangerous viruses, especially but not limited to influenza.”
The debate over this type of research dates back to at least 2011, when research was done on flu strains made to spread in ferrets.
Paul cited the Cambridge Working Group in his May 11 and 13 remarks. But the group has not made “any statement … about work in Wuhan,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and one of the founder members of the group, said on Twitter.
Lipsitch further said that some members of the working group “may categorically oppose all GOF studies that enhance virulence, transmission, or immune escape. My personal view is that some such studies can be justified on risk-benefit grounds, while those on flu to date cannot.”
On Dec. 19, 2017, the U.S. government’s pause, or moratorium, was lifted. The Department of Health and Human Services announced a framework for evaluating whether funding should be granted for research involving “enhanced potential pandemic pathogens,” or PPPs. It said research on PPPs was “essential to protecting global health and security,” but the risks needed to be considered and mitigated.
The framework defined a “potential pandemic pathogen” as one that was both “likely highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations” and “likely highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans.” And an enhanced PPP was a PPP “resulting from the enhancement of the transmissibility and/or virulence of a pathogen.”
The framework said enhanced PPPs don’t include “naturally occurring pathogens that are circulating in or have been recovered from nature.”
EcoHealth Grant
So, did the NIH’s grant to EcoHealth fund gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab? There are differing opinions on that. As noted above, whether research is “likely” or “reasonably anticipated” to enhance transmissibility can be subjective.
EcoHealth and the NIH and NIAID say no. “EcoHealth Alliance has not nor does it plan to engage in gain-of-function research,” EcoHealth spokesman Robert Kessler told us in an email. Nor did the grant get an exception from the pause, as some have speculated, he said. “No dispensation was needed as no gain-of-function research was being conducted.”
The NIAID told the Wall Street Journal: “The research by EcoHealth Alliance, Inc. that NIH funded was for a project that aimed to characterize at the molecular level the function of newly discovered bat spike proteins and naturally occurring pathogens. Molecular characterization examines functions of an organism at the molecular level, in this case a virus and a spike protein, without affecting the environment or development or physiological state of the organism. At no time did NIAID fund gain-of-function research to be conducted at WIV.”
And in a May 19 statement, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said that “neither NIH nor NIAID have ever approved any grant that would have supported ‘gain-of-function’ research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans.”
Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University and a critic of gain-of-function research, told the Washington Post that the EcoHealth/Wuhan lab research “was — unequivocally — gain-of-function research.” He said it “met the definition for gain-of-function research of concern under the 2014 Pause.” That definition, as we said, pertained to “projects that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route.”
Alina Chan, a molecular biologist and postdoctoral researcher at the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, said in a lengthy Twitter thread that the Wuhan subgrant wouldn’t fall under the gain-of-function moratorium because the definition didn’t include testing on naturally occurring viruses “unless the tests are reasonably anticipated to increase transmissibility and/or pathogenicity.” She said the moratorium had “no teeth.” But the EcoHealth/Wuhan grant “was testing naturally occurring SARS viruses, without a reasonable expectation that the tests would increase transmissibility or pathogenicity. Therefore, it is reasonable that they would have been excluded from the moratorium.”
Chan, who has published research about the possibility of an accidental lab leak of the virus, also said: “But we need to separate this fight about whether a particular project is GOF vs whether it has risk of lab accident + causing an outbreak.”
The University of Iowa’s Perlman told us the EcoHealth research is trying to see if these viruses can infect human cells and what about the spike protein on the virus determines that. (The spike protein is what the coronavirus uses to enter cells.) The NIH, he said, wouldn’t give money to anybody to do gain-of-function research “per se … especially in China,” and he didn’t think there was anything in the EcoHealth grant description that would be gain of function. But he said there’s a lot of nuance to this discussion.
“This was not intentional gain of function,” Perlman said, adding that in this type of research “these viruses are almost always attenuated,” meaning weakened. The gain of function would be what comes out of the research “unintentionally,” but the initial goal of the project is what you would want to look at: can these viruses infect people, how likely would they be to mutate in order to do that, and “let’s get a catalog of these viruses out there.”
Perlman also said that making a virus that could infect human cells in a lab doesn’t mean the virus is more infectious for humans. Viruses adapt to the cell culture, he said, and may grow well in a cell culture but then, for instance, not actually infect mice very well.
Back in February, MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt told PolitiFact.com that a 2017 paper published with the help of the EcoHealth grant involved, as PolitiFact described it, “certain techniques that … seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research.” But Esvelt said “the work reported in this specific paper definitely did NOT lead to the creation of SARS-CoV-2,” because of differences between the virus studied and SARS-CoV-2.
In the May 11 hearing, Paul also pointed to the work of Ralph S. Baric, a professor of epidemiology and a microbiologist who studies coronaviruses at the University of North Carolina. Paul described Baric’s research as “gain of function” in collaboration with the Wuhan lab. A 2015 paper by Baric, Shi and others, published with NIH funding in the journal Nature Medicine, examined the potential of SARS-like bat coronaviruses to lead to human disease. Researchers created a “chimeric virus” with the spike protein of the bat coronavirus and a mouse-adapted SARS backbone and found viruses could replicate in human airway cells. The study said “the creation of chimeric viruses … was not expected to increase pathogenicity.”
Fauci told Paul at the hearing: “Dr. Baric does not do gain-of-function research, and if it is, it’s according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina, not in China.”
In a statement to us, Baric said: “Our work was approved by the NIH, was peer reviewed, and P3CO reviewed,” meaning reviewed under the HHS 2017 framework. “We followed all safety protocols, and our work was considered low risk because of the strain of coronaviruses being studied. It is because of our early work that the United States was in a position to quickly find the first successful treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and an effective COVID-19 vaccine.”
Kelsey Cooper, Paul’s communications director, told us “there is ample evidence that the NIH and the NIAID, under his direction, funded gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” citing Ebright’s statements. “In light of those facts, the question Dr. Paul asked was whether the government has fully investigated the origin of the disease, which it clearly has not. This research and the lab should be thoroughly investigated and opened to public scrutiny.”
Perlman told us that he thought Fauci’s response in the May 11 exchange was correct — that no money was given for gain-of-function research. But, he added, there’s a scientific discussion to be had on the benefits and risks of research making recombinant viruses, which involves rearranging or combining genetic material. The politicization of the issue, Perlman said, “doesn’t do anybody good.”
Update, July 1: Please see our June 25 story “The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus” for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic. ",Lori Robertson,2021-05-21 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"That report said a laboratory leak of a virus, involving “an accidental infection of staff,” was “an extremely unlikely pathway,” but the WHO director-general said that he didn’t believe the evaluation “was extensive enough.”
“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the day the report was publicly released on March 30. Baric does not do gain-of-function research, and if it is, it’s according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina, not in China.”
In a statement to us, Baric said: “Our work was approved by the NIH, was peer reviewed, and P3CO reviewed,” meaning reviewed under the HHS 2017 framework. “So we really had to learn a lot more about the viruses that were there, about whether or not people were getting infected with bad viruses.”
He called the EcoHealth collaboration “a very minor collaboration as part of a subcontract of a grant,” and said Paul conflated that with the claim that “therefore we were involved in creating the virus, which is the most ridiculous, majestic leap I’ve ever heard of.”
Fauci said he wasn’t convinced that the coronavirus developed naturally. “Specifically, the funding pause will apply to gain-of-function research projects that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route,” the White House said in an Oct. 17, 2014, announcement. At issue is whether the National Institutes of Health funded research on bat coronaviruses that could have caused a pathogen to become more infectious to humans and, separately, if SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 — transferred naturally from bats to humans, possibly through an intermediate host animal, or if a virus, a naturally occurring one or a lab-enhanced one, was accidentally released from the Wuhan lab."
147,"Researcher Distorts Facts on COVID-19 Vaccine Approval, Liability",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-researcher-distorts-facts-on-covid-19-vaccine-approval-liability/,,"The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration, though an emergency use authorization also remains in place. Dr. Robert Malone misleadingly said Americans are being offered the shot only under the latter and that it carried different liability ramifications. The liability protections, afforded under a public health law, are the same for the two.

The Food and Drug Administration issued the first full approval for a COVID-19 vaccine on Aug. 23. The full licensure for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine, called Comirnaty — specifically for those 16 and older — arrived some eight months after the vaccine first rolled out in the U.S. under an emergency use authorization.
An EUA is typically less stringent than the full licensure, which is called a biologics license application. But for the COVID-19 vaccine EUA, the FDA included some more rigorous requirements. The full licensure was based on more data from the phase 3 clinical trials, which monitored more than half of participants for at least four months after their second shots.
Online, the news of the FDA approval was in some circles met by claims trying to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the licensure. Some dubiously asserted federal officials had pulled a “bait and switch” on the public.
“FDA ‘playing bait and switch’ with Americans, tricking them into believing shots currently being offered have been granted full approval when they have not,” declared the headline on LeoHohmann.com, shared on Facebook more than 5,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.

The story cited an interview with Dr. Robert Malone, a scientist who claims he invented mRNA technology and who has cast doubt on the COVID-19 vaccines in recent months.
In an interview with political strategist Steve Bannon on Aug. 24, Malone misleadingly said that the fully licensed product is not yet available — even though federal officials say the licensed vaccine is the same formulation as, and interchangeable with, the vaccine authorized for emergency use. He then falsely claimed that the vaccine that is available carries with it different liability implications.


Malone, “Bannon’s War Room,” Aug. 24: It’s absolutely not available. … The Pfizer vaccine, which is what is currently available, is still under emergency use authorization and it still has the liability shield. … The product that’s licensed is the BioNTech product which is substantially similar but not necessarily identical. It’s called Comirnaty … and it’s not yet available. They haven’t started manufacturing it or labeling it. And that’s the one that the liability waiver will no longer apply to. So the one that’s actually licensed is not yet available and when it does become available, it will no longer have the liability shield.


The interview — in which Malone also claimed that “once again, the mainstream media has lied to you” — also appeared on the website Rumble and has been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
While the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are largely shielded from liability, as we’ll explain, Malone is wrong that the fully licensed Pfizer/BioNTech product falls outside those protections.
David Bowman, a spokesperson for the Health Resources and Services Administration — the federal agency that oversees compensation programs for those who allege injuries following vaccination — told us in an email that there “are no liability or compensation differences between a countermeasure approved under an EUA or one that has received full FDA approval.”
Malone did not respond to our request for comment, but acknowledged in an Aug. 30 tweet that he was “wrong” about the purported differences in liability. Malone told the Washington Post‘s Fact Checker: “On this particular legal liability issue I did not hunt down the details myself, and relied on comments from a third party lawyer which were not fully correct.”
Vaccine Under EUA & Full Approval Use Same Formula
It’s true that an emergency use authorization still exists for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It authorizes the two-dose vaccine for those age 12 and older — and a third dose for those who are immunocompromised — while the FDA’s full approval pertains to those 16 and older.
In an Aug. 23 letter to Pfizer, the FDA said “the EUA will remain in place for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for the previously-authorized indication and uses, and to authorize use of COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) under this EUA for certain uses that are not included in the approved [biologics license application].”
The letter noted that, although Comirnaty is approved, “there is not sufficient approved vaccine available for distribution to this population in its entirety at the time of reissuance of this EUA. Additionally, there are no products that are approved to prevent COVID-19 in individuals age 12 through 15, or that are approved to provide an additional dose to the immunocompromised population described in this EUA.”
So, in short, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine authorized for emergency use continues to be available both to meet demand and because it can be used for individuals — those 12 to 15, for example — for whom the full licensure of the vaccine isn’t yet applicable.
But the FDA said that “the licensed vaccine has the same formulation as the EUA-authorized vaccine and the products can be used interchangeably to provide the vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. The products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.”
Pfizer’s representative told us the “legally distinct” reference relates to differences in manufacturing — for example, the licensed product may be made at different sites or use materials from different approved suppliers.
Liability Protections
The liability protections at the heart of Malone’s claim stem from a federal law that in part affords broad protections to vaccine manufacturers and administrators in the event of a public health emergency. The Department of Health and Human Services invoked that law, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, in early 2020 as the U.S. began to grapple with COVID-19.
As the Congressional Research Service explains, “covered persons are generally immune from legal liability (i.e., they cannot be sued for money damages in court) for losses relating to the administration or use of covered countermeasures against COVID-19.”
“The sole exception to PREP Act immunity is for death or serious physical injury caused by ‘willful misconduct,'” the CRS report says.
The report explains: “In the PREP Act, Congress made the judgment that, in the context of a public health emergency, immunizing certain persons and entities from liability was necessary to ensure that potentially life-saving countermeasures will be efficiently developed, deployed, and administered.”
The initial 2020 Department of Health and Human Services declaration invoking the PREP Act defined “Covered Countermeasures” as “any antiviral, any other drug, any biologic, any diagnostic, any other device, or any vaccine, used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID-19, or the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or a virus mutating therefrom, or any device used in the administration of any such product, and all components and constituent materials of any such product.”
Subsequent amendments have expanded that definition. For example, it also now applies to products that “limit the harm COVID-19 might otherwise cause.” 
Like HRSA, the Pfizer representative told us that the liability protections pursuant to the public health emergency extend to both the vaccine under emergency use authorization and to the fully licensed Comirnaty.
While the companies are protected from liability, the CRS notes, “individuals who die or suffer serious injuries directly caused by the administration of covered countermeasures may be eligible to receive compensation through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program,” or CICP — a federal system.
And Bowman, the HRSA spokesperson, also told us that both “FDA authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines, including Comirnaty, are covered countermeasures under” CICP.
Outside of a public health emergency, manufacturers of routine vaccines are also largely shielded from claims. As we’ve explained before, that protection dates back to the 1970s, when vaccine makers and health care providers were facing costly lawsuits that put their operations in question — leading Congress to pass the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986.


That act, while giving manufacturers protections from lawsuits, created a compensation program known as the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, or VICP. It also requires health care providers to report side effects that occur after immunization to the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System.
While the COVID-19 vaccines fall under CICP, at some point the COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be added to VICP, said Renée Gentry, director of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at George Washington University.
“Once it’s no longer in emergency use and it’s recommended for children, it should go into the VICP,” Gentry told us in a phone interview.
There is bipartisan legislation in Congress to expedite the addition of new vaccines to VICP, which normally can take upward of two years, Gentry noted.
The transition of a vaccine from CICP (an administrative process) to VICP (a legal process) does raise some questions and concerns — including whether those who file under CICP (which has a one-year statute of limitations) will be able to pursue a claim under VICP, Gentry said. There are key differences, including that the latter comes with the right to an attorney and to appeal.
There have been 686 claims for allegations of deaths or injuries filed with CICP in relation to the COVID-19 vaccines, as of Aug. 2, though almost all are still being adjudicated. One claim — for “Swelling of the Tongue and Throat, Difficulty Speaking and Swallowing and Dizziness” — is listed as being resolved and was denied because “the standard of proof for causation was not met and/or a covered injury was not sustained.”
As we’ve explained before, hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the U.S., with most recipients reporting minor, temporary side effects such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache or muscle pain. There have been some rare, more serious side effects observed with the vaccines — though health officials say the benefits continue to outweigh the risks.

148,"Trump, Biden and the Defense Production Act",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-biden-and-the-defense-production-act/,,"Leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden repeatedly has criticized President Donald Trump for failing to make timely use of his powers under the Defense Production Act to compel companies to manufacture medical supplies that are expected to be needed to treat those infected with the novel coronavirus.
Biden claims he was one of the first to call for the need to use the Defense Production Act. The Trump campaign says Biden only began calling for that on the same day — March 18 — that Trump said he was invoking the act. There’s a bit of spin coming from both sides on this.
We couldn’t find evidence that Biden has been calling for use of the law for as long as he suggests, and Trump did not invoke the full force of the act back on March 18.
With the use of the Defense Production Act becoming a frequent point of contention between Trump and his critics, we thought it would be helpful to explain what the act is and how Trump has (and has not) applied it to date.
What Is the Defense Production Act?
First enacted in 1950 in response to the Korean War and last amended in 2018, the Defense Production Act provides the president broad authority to “influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense,” as a Congressional Research Service report put it in 2020.
“The authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense,” the CRS report states.
The law authorizes the president to identify businesses “capable” of producing “scarce and critical material” to “require acceptance and performance” of contracts to meet those needs. The act also allows the president to incentivize U.S. companies to expand production of critical materials with such things as “loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities,” the CRS report says.
As the New York Times reported, the law has been used hundreds of thousands of times during the Trump administration, “especially by the military to give its contract priority ratings to jump ahead of a vendor’s other clients.” The Times noted that in recent years, the administration has also used the powers contained in the act to restore power grids and to supply emergency food and water in areas devastated by hurricanes in 2017.
On Feb. 28, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar first signaled that the administration might use the Defense Production Act for the coronavirus to expedite contracts for medical supplies, such as face masks and gloves.
“I don’t have any procurements I need it for now, but if I need it, we’ll use it,” Azar said at a White House briefing.
“We’ll use it if we need to, but we, obviously, if we can work cooperatively with any vendor, we’d rather do that,” Azar said in a March 1 interview on “Fox News Sunday.”
On March 13, 57 House Democrats wrote a letter urging the president to “use the powers afforded by the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq.) to begin the mass production of supplies needed to address the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.”
The letter highlighted the likelihood of shortages of N95 respirators and face masks, testing equipment, and medical supplies like ventilators, and warned that “failure to act now” could “endanger American lives.”
“These authorities could be used to direct the domestic production of equipment currently in short supply, like personal protective equipment and ventilators,” the letter states. “This would ensure we have the materials we need at the ready, rather than wait for disruptions in the global supply chain to subside.
“During World War II, our country adapted to the demands of the time to produce mass quantities of bombers, tanks, and many small items needed to save democracy and freedom in the world,” the letter stated. “We know what the demands of this time are, and we must act now to meet these demands. We urge you to invoke the Defense Production Act without delay.”
Trump Invokes the Defense Production Act
Five days later, on March 18, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act “just in case we need it.” But Trump stopped short of implementing the act to force production of certain goods. Later that day, Trump tweeted, “I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need.”
Via Twitter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the move as “an important step,” but added, “so much more is needed NOW.”
That same day, Biden released a statement on “immediate actions” he believed the Trump administration should take to address the pandemic. It called for Trump to “Prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis — such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate — by invoking the Defense Production Act, delegating authority to HHS and FEMA. This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios.”
In the following days, Trump said that he was reluctant to use the Defense Production Act to force corporations to make products, likening such a move to “nationalizing our businesses.”
Trump, March 22: We’re a country not based on nationalizing our business. Call a person over in Venezuela; ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out. Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept.
Besides, he said, companies were voluntarily stepping up with offers to produce masks, ventilators and other needed medical supplies and equipment.
Trump, March 26: For the most part, the companies … We say, “We need this,” and they say, “Don’t bother. We’re going to do it.” I mean, we — we’re dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M. We’re dealing with great companies. They want to do this. They want to do this. They’re doing things that — that frankly, they don’t need somebody to walk over there with a — with a hammer and say, “Do it.” They are getting it done.
We should note that compelling a company to produce supplies is not the same as “nationalizing” the business. Under the act, private businesses would be paid for their production and would remain private companies, not government entities.
What Biden Said and When
In recent days, Biden has criticized Trump for failing to fully use the Defense Production Act, something he says Trump should have done weeks or even months ago. Biden has also cast himself as one of the earliest to call for it.

According to a March 22 pool report of a Biden phone call, the Democratic candidate “reiterated his call for the president to invoke the ‘full power of the Defense Production Act’ and noted he called for that a month ago.”
In a YouTube speech on March 23, Biden said, “As of late yesterday, we’re told that the president still has not activated the authority under the Defense Production Act, which I and others call for him to invoke immediately and act on, to direct American manufacturers to make essential supplies. Trump keeps saying that he’s a wartime president, well start to act like one. … We need to get in motion. Get in motion today what we should have set in motion weeks ago.
“I would have enacted it a long time ago, Jake,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on March 24. “I think it was three — two, three weeks ago I pointed out that the president should enact this. It should have been enacted months ago.”
During an online news conference the following day, Biden said, “I think it’s really important that we understand that this idea of this Defense Production Act, he talks about signing, he doesn’t want to dictate to companies. There’s things we need now, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but months ago or a month ago, and the president’s not acting.”
And finally, on MSNBC on March 30, Biden said, “I talked about doing the Defense Production Act before anyone came along.”

The Trump campaign said that as far as it could tell, the first time Biden ever called for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was on March 18, the same day Trump invoked it (but did not use it to compel a company to start producing something).
We reached out to the Biden campaign for evidence that Biden had called for use of the Defense Production Act prior to that, but we got no response. We could not find any public comments from Biden prior to the statement he put out on March 18 — which we referenced earlier.
Prior to March 18, we found instances of Biden talking generally, as he did on March 12, about the need to “surge our capacity” at hospitals, and make “sure communities have the hospital beds available, the staff, the medical supplies, the personal protective equipment necessary to treat the patient.”
Biden did not mention the Defense Production Act in the Democratic debate on March 15, where he encouraged viewers to see his full, detailed plan to combat COVID-19 on his campaign website. Nor does that plan, which was initially posted to the campaign website on March 12, mention the Defense Production Act. 
Biden’s plan says only that the federal government should “[w]ork with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and additional products such as bleach and alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Incentivize greater supplier production of these critically important medically supplies, including committing, if necessary, to large scale volume purchasing and removing all relevant trade barriers to their acquisition.”
“Work[ing] with businesses to expand production of personal protective equipment” was essentially the Trump administration policy at the time.
If his first public call for Trump to use the Defense Production Act was March 18, Biden would have been exaggerating when he said on March 22 that he called for that a month before, or on March 24 when he said he made those calls “two, three weeks ago.”
It also would have been five days after 57 House members wrote to the president urging him to use the act, and two days after his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, publicly called on Trump “to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in the United States of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our health care workers need.”
We will update this story if the Biden campaign gets back to us with earlier examples.
We can say for sure, though, that Biden has repeatedly claimed to have issued a warning about the seriousness of the virus earlier than he actually did.
“All of the way back in January 17, I wrote a piece for U.S. News & World Report saying, ‘We have got a real problem. The president, we have — coronavirus is real. We have to start acting now,'” Biden said in a March 24 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper.
The op-ed he wrote was actually for USA Today, and it was published on Jan. 27, not Jan. 17. Those 10 days make a big difference. Biden’s op-ed on Jan. 27 was just four days before the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on those who had traveled to China in the previous two weeks. Had Biden published that op-ed on Jan. 17, he would have been well ahead of the curve.
We would chalk up Biden’s date mix-up to a simple misstatement, but he has cited that same incorrect date at least three other times since.

“For example, way back in January 17th I argued that this virus was coming. I did a, I think it was US News and World Report, I did a piece on saying it’s coming. We’ve got to prepare,” Biden said in an online news conference on March 25
“I wrote an article back in January 17th saying we should be prepared now and laid out the things that I thought we should be doing then,” he said in a CNN town hall on March 27.
“You may recall, I was the first one to call for the president, way back in January 17th, to take this seriously,” Biden said on March 30 on MSNBC. “A real serious crisis is coming, an article I wrote.”

Trump Uses Defense Production Act
On March 23, Trump signed a new executive order “to prohibit the hoarding of needed resources,” citing the authority given to him under the Defense Production Act. On March 30, federal authorities invoked that order when they charged a Brooklyn man for hoarding surgical masks, medical gowns and other medical supplies that authorities said he was selling at inflated prices from his home.
Despite his early reluctance to employ the Defense Production Act to compel businesses to make supplies necessary for the COVID-19 response, Trump said in a March 27 press conference that he had invoked the act “to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.”
Trump also tapped Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, to act as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator. At the press conference, Navarro explained that the Defense Production Act was employed to compel General Motors to make ventilators only after the federal government “ran into roadblocks” in its negotiations with GM over production.
Navarro, March 27: We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run, to help people of New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country, as this virus bears down. And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill. They’re literally the lifeline for people. And I’ve personally been working with FEMA, and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible. And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time — which is to say as soon as possible, sir. But we did have a problem with GM and Ventec. On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible. Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM. We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days. So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization.
In an interview on CNN on March 31, Biden said Trump’s action was too slow, and too limited.
Biden, March 31: And he’s been very slow to act. For whatever the reason has been. Been very slow to act on a whole range of things. For example, he still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act. Which I called for a while ago. He finally did with General Motors after a little roundabout in terms of building ventilators. What about the masks? What about those gowns that those nurses and doctors need? They’re made of paper. What about the goggles the need, the face shields, what about the gloves they need? He can do that by the Defense Production Act right now. He could have done it yesterday, a week ago, three weeks ago, five weeks ago. They’re in short supply. And our first responders are literally risking and some losing their lives to try to help the American people.
Biden is entitled to his opinion that the president acted slowly and “still hasn’t fully invoked the Defense Production Act.” But we could find no evidence that Biden called for the president to use the act prior to March 18, despite his repeated claims that he had done so much earlier.",Robert Farley,2020-04-02 0:00:00,half true,,mix,False,"There’s things we need now, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but months ago or a month ago, and the president’s not acting.”

149,White House and HHS Employees Aren’t ‘Exempt’ from Vaccine Mandate,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-white-house-and-hhs-employees-arent-exempt-from-vaccine-mandate/,,"
President Joe Biden on Sept. 9 announced a six-point plan aimed at combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, and the first part of the strategy is increasing the vaccination rate.
To do that, Biden introduced vaccination mandates for some employers. The specifics haven’t been determined yet for some parts of his plan, but misleading claims about which employers will be “exempt” have been circulating online.
One viral version of the claim lists 11 businesses, government branches, or federal agencies as being “exempt.”
That list includes a mixture of entities that are actually covered under the mandates, some that are not covered, and some that might be covered  — but it’s unclear without more guidance about the directives.
The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, which Biden established on his first day in office, is tasked with developing guidance for implementing Biden’s executive order requiring federal employees to be vaccinated. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, is tasked with developing a rule for employers with 100 or more employees that would require workers to get vaccinated or get tested at least once a week.
Neither the task force nor OSHA has published those details as of this posting. So, we’ll go through what we know for each of the entities listed in the social media claim as being “exempt.”
“Congress/legislative branch” and “Congress staff”
Biden’s executive order requiring federal employees to be vaccinated doesn’t apply to members of Congress. It applies only to executive branch employees, as is true of executive orders generally.
“The president has a lot of authority over employees of the EXECUTIVE branch,” Andrew Reeves explained in an email to FactCheck.org (emphasis his). Reeves is a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis and author of a book on executive branch politics.
The legislative and judicial branches are separate and independent.
“The separation of powers — one of the hallmarks of the American political system — is the principle at work here,” Reeves said.
A 2019 Congressional Research Service report on presidential directives described executive orders as being “directed at executive branch officials and instruct them on how to manage agency operations.”
In addition to the separation of powers, Reeves noted that the statutes cited in the executive order — Title 5 sections 3301, 3302 and 7301 — don’t extend to the legislative and judicial branches.
As for whether or not the forthcoming OSHA rule will apply to workers in the legislative branch, that’s unclear.
Currently in Congress, each member’s office makes its own rules regarding vaccination, according to an August memo from the Office of House Employment Counsel.
That memo also notes that “[u]nder the General Duty Clause of the OSHA, each employer must provide a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious physical harm. COVID-19 is considered a recognized hazard.”
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which created OSHA and gave it authority to set workplace safety standards, gives OSHA the ability to “promulgate, modify, or revoke occupational safety and health standards that apply to private sector employers, the United States Postal Service, and the federal government as an employer,” a recent Congressional Research Service report explained.
OSHA didn’t respond to our request for clarification on which federal employers would be covered by its forthcoming rule.
“Judicial branch”
For the same reason as the legislative branch, the judicial branch isn’t covered by the executive order.
“The President’s Safety Principles are directed at executive branch departments and agencies,” a spokeswoman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts told us in an email.  “They do not apply directly to the Judiciary with the exception of common areas in multi-tenant facilities. Any decisions regarding vaccination or testing are made by individual courts based on a number of factors, including the health status of the local community.”
“White House staff”
White House staff are federal employees subject to the executive order.
“He’s the boss. These are his employees,” Peter Meyers, professor of law emeritus at the George Washington University Law School, said of Biden in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.
Specifically, he said, the executive order cites section 7301 of Title 5, which says: “The President may prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch.”
“It couldn’t be clearer,” Meyers said.
A White House official also confirmed to FactCheck.org that staff members are subject to the vaccine requirement.
“CDC employees”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is within the Department of Health and Human Services, which is listed as an executive department in Title 5. The executive order requiring vaccination for federal employees cites that statute, so employees of the CDC are included.
“FDA employees”
The Food and Drug Administration is within the Department of Health and Human Services, which is listed as an executive department in Title 5. The executive order requiring vaccination for federal employees cites that statute, so employees of the FDA are included.
“USPS employees”
The U.S. Postal Service isn’t an executive department, so it’s not covered by the executive order. But it may be obligated to comply with the OSHA rule that is now being drafted.
As we noted above, OSHA has authority to set workplace safety standards that apply to the postal service. According to the Department of Labor’s website, “Under a 1998 amendment to the OSH Act, the U.S. Postal Service is covered under the OSH Act just like any private sector employer.”
The American Postal Workers Union, though, said in a statement, “Until this emergency rule is developed, the APWU will not know if it applies to Postal Service employees. Once the emergency rule is released it will be reviewed and discussed with our attorneys and additional information on how it applies will be released.”
The union also said, “As the APWU has continually stated, all employees are encouraged to wear face coverings at work and are encouraged to voluntarily receive one of the COVID-19 vaccines.”
We also asked the postal service if it expected the OSHA rule to apply, and a spokesman provided us with a statement that said in part: “Because the Postal Service is an independent federal agency that operates under a private sector collective bargaining model, modifications to working conditions are mandatory subjects of bargaining. In addition, our workplaces are subject to regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Therefore, we are working closely with our union leadership so that once OSHA’s COVID-19 Vaccination Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) is issued we can move quickly to determine its applicability to our employees and how best to implement.”
A senior advisor at OSHA reportedly said that postal employees would be subject to the rule, but OSHA didn’t respond to our request for  confirmation.
“NIAID employees”
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is within the Department of Health and Human Services, which is listed as an executive department in Title 5. The executive order requiring vaccination for federal employees cites that statute, so employees of the NIAID are included.
“Pfizer employees”
Pfizer — which worked with German company BioNTech to develop the first COVID-19 vaccine to get full approval from the FDA — announced in August that it would require its U.S. employees to either get vaccinated or agree to weekly testing.
A Pfizer spokesperson confirmed to FactCheck.org that the company is “requiring all U.S. colleagues and contractors to be fully vaccinated, unless approved for a medical or religious accommodation from vaccination.”
The company is also expecting to be covered by the OSHA rule, the spokesperson said.
“Moderna employees”
Similarly, Moderna — which developed another COVID-19 vaccine — already requires its U.S. employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Also, since it has more than 1,800 employees, it is likely to be covered by the OSHA rule.
“Illegal aliens”
These mandates apply based on employment status, not citizenship status. No part of Biden’s plan mentions immigrants or “illegal aliens.”",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-10-07 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"COVID-19 is considered a recognized hazard.”
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which created OSHA and gave it authority to set workplace safety standards, gives OSHA the ability to “promulgate, modify, or revoke occupational safety and health standards that apply to private sector employers, the United States Postal Service, and the federal government as an employer,” a recent Congressional Research Service report explained. Specifically, he said, the executive order cites section 7301 of Title 5, which says: “The President may prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch.”
“It couldn’t be clearer,” Meyers said. So, we’ll go through what we know for each of the entities listed in the social media claim as being “exempt.”
“Congress/legislative branch” and “Congress staff”
Biden’s executive order requiring federal employees to be vaccinated doesn’t apply to members of Congress. One viral version of the claim lists 11 businesses, government branches, or federal agencies as being “exempt.”
That list includes a mixture of entities that are actually covered under the mandates, some that are not covered, and some that might be covered  — but it’s unclear without more guidance about the directives. Postal Service is covered under the OSH Act just like any private sector employer.”
The American Postal Workers Union, though, said in a statement, “Until this emergency rule is developed, the APWU will not know if it applies to Postal Service employees."
150,Viral Posts Distort WHO Guidance on COVID-19 Tests,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/01/scicheck-viral-posts-distort-who-guidance-on-covid-19-tests/,,"SciCheck Digest
Dubious websites and viral posts falsely claim that the World Health Organization changed COVID-19 testing protocols for political reasons following Joe Biden’s inauguration and admitted that false-positive cases had been inflating the case count. The WHO’s guidance merely reminded labs to follow instructions provided by each test’s manufacturer.

Full Story
A recent memo from the World Health Organization designed for lab professionals became a major focus of misinformation — with unreliable websites and social media users claiming the agency had changed a testing protocol and admitted that COVID-19 cases have been wildly inflated.
But neither of those claims is accurate.
Instead, the Jan. 20 memo directed labs facilitating polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests to carefully follow manufacturer instructions for testing to prevent false positive and negative results.
The distortions online also tied the purported change to U.S. politics.
“An Hour After Joe Biden Is Sworn In, WHO Admits Their Testing Grossly Overstates Individuals Testing Positive for COVID,” read a headline from the Gateway Pundit, a website known for spreading misinformation. The story questioned the motives of public health agencies, asking, “how can these entities ever be trusted again?”
The story was shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
Another website, Zero Hedge, which also has previously spread falsehoods, similarly told readers: “Right On Cue For Biden, WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives.” That story was shared on Facebook nearly 7,000 times.

Many posts also cited a viral tweet from David Samadi, a urologist and contributor to the conservative news channel Newsmax, whose work in a New York hospital was the subject of a federal investigation into fraudulent Medicare claims. That hospital reached a $12.3 million settlement in late 2019.
In his tweet, which has since been deleted, Samadi said the guidance instructed labs “to reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,” because “the current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.” One Facebook post sharing Samadi’s tweet claimed that the guidance proved “they’ve been lying to you about case counts and mortality rate THE WHOLE TIME.”
As we said, the WHO guidance implied no such admission. And the memo was an updated version of one issued a month earlier, on Dec. 14, so the idea that it was timed for Biden’s inauguration is wrong.
As we’ve explained before, PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. (See our SciCheck article “The Facts on Coronavirus Testing.”)
The PCR test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load, meaning more virus is present in the sample, will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles.
There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — “although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint” of a PCR run — Ian MacKay, a virologist in Australia, told us in an email. 
The WHO’s Jan. 20 guidance said it was requesting that those conducting tests be sure to read manufacturer instructions “carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended.”
In a statement to FactCheck.org, the WHO said it had received 10 reports since early 2020 about some PCR tests providing both false positive and false negative results and that “[a]fter thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that the tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.” 

“In particular, users in laboratories encountered problems with these tests when they did not apply the recommended positivity threshold — this can result in either false negative results (if the threshold applied is lower) or false positives (if threshold is higher),” the WHO said.
MacKay said that problem “is not a test issue; it’s a human training and experience issue.”
“I suspect this is more a problem for certain countries or jurisdictions where rapid roll-out of new testing labs has occurred; labs that are new to public health testing,” MacKay said. “This would typically involve places that have failed to adequately invest in a good public health laboratory network, to begin with. I don’t think anything shows changing threshold values or less experienced laboratories have driven significant inflation of COVID-19 case counts though.”
Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said in a phone interview that the WHO guidance was a simple reminder that if lab professionals deviate from the recommended manufacturer thresholds they’re “going to over- or under-call the positives or negatives.” She said the issue was not a significant concern in the U.S.
In a blog post batting down the misconceptions about the WHO’s guidance, MacKay wrote that “this lab-focused advice has been taken by those with malicious intent, or with too little understanding of the topic, and blown it up into something else entirely wrong.”
He further emphasized to us that “PCR results are not a diagnosis by themselves” — they’re part of the COVID-19 diagnosis. WHO advises they be considered in context of other factors, including symptoms and potential exposure to COVID-19.
Understanding Cycle Threshold Values

PCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue — even positive results at high-cycle threshold values — experts say.
For example, MacKay has observed that, looking at COVID-19 data on tests in the United Kingdom, even reducing the “cycle number by 10 (from, for example, 45 to 35), for the sake of appeasement, the majority of positives would still be uncontroversially positive.”
Matthew Binnicker, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, said the true debate over results at high-cycle threshold values isn’t whether they are “false positives.”
“PCR tests are very specific, and these are not false-positives,” he told us in an email. “The test is doing what it was designed to do — detect the viral RNA in samples.”
Instead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used “to determine whether someone is, or is not, ‘infectious'” to others. In other words, the question isn’t whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced. 
“Some would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious,” Binnicker said. 
But, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness.
And, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so it’s not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus.
Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values “doesn’t mean they’re false positive, they’re still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.”
Mina said during a call with reporters that the WHO’s memo served as a reminder that “you have to be discerning about how to evaluate” cycle threshold values. “And if you’re going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making, [it’s important] to really know what it is you’re doing.”
For example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value — which could mean “you already were infectious and you maybe don’t need to be isolated,” he said.
“But it’s very hard to know that. You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again,” he added. “Or, test them with an antigen test. That would be the other way to approach it.” (Antigen tests are a different type of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.)
Binnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend PCR tests be used to determine when someone is no longer infectious. Instead, the agency advises relying on time and symptoms to break from quarantine or isolation.

151,Facebook Post Repeats Flawed Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/facebook-post-repeats-flawed-claim-on-wuhan-lab-funding/,,"Quick Take
A Facebook post is spreading the false claim that former President Barack Obama gave $3.8 million to a lab in Wuhan, China. The money referenced was actually provided to a U.S. research group. Only $600,000 went to the lab as part of a U.S.-approved collaboration. 


Full Story 
A post circulating on Facebook is spreading a debunked falsehood about U.S. funding that went to a lab in Wuhan, China — the city where the outbreak of the novel coronavirus began — as well as a false claim about the origins of the virus.
“President Trump just announced that the ‘biological’ lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created was ‘funded’ by President Barak Hussein Obama in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars,” the post reads. It further claims, falsely, that “this fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!”
The post, a text image, was uploaded as early as April but is continuing to spread.
First of all, the suggestion that the virus was “created” is a baseless conspiracy theory that we first wrote about in February. We’ve continued to debunk similar claims.
The post’s main claim about U.S. funding is one that we’ve also previously addressed.
The $3.8 million figure refers actually to a $3.4 million grant that the National Institutes of Health awarded to a U.S.-based group, EcoHealth Alliance. That group was studying the risk of future emergence of coronaviruses from bats and first received the grant in 2014.
Of that amount, EcoHealth gave $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology — a collaborator on the project that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department — Robert Kessler, EcoHealth’s spokesperson, previously told us.
The grant was renewed in 2019 for another five years, Kessler said — and EcoHealth received $292,161 that year (part of the total $3.4 million it received). NIH terminated the grant in April.
President Donald Trump has also previously floated an unsupported claim that the amount received by the Wuhan lab was even higher — $7.5 million — and that he “ended it.” But as we explained before, the grant that was discontinued was EcoHealth’s and the portion that went to the lab was $600,000.
A Fox News story in April also made reference to another $3.4 million NIH grant — regarding a behavioral study — and suggested that some of the funding may have gone to the Wuhan lab. (The story noted, however, that it was “not clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants.”)
But the recipient of that other grant, which was renewed this year — Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York — told us that wasn’t the case.
“[B]ased on CSHL’s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab’s vice president of communications, told us in an email.


Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for “more investigation” to determine how the pandemic began. “Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,” they wrote. “Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.”
Update, June 29, 2021: Please see our June 25 story “The Facts – and Gaps – on the Origin of the Coronavirus” for a detailed examination of the debate over the origin of the pandemic.

152,Infographic on Facebook Distorts Comparative Facts on Viruses,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/infographic-on-facebook-distorts-comparative-facts-on-viruses/,,"Quick Take
A misleading chart being spread on Facebook, erroneously dubbing the new coronavirus the “least deadly virus,” contains outdated information about the coronavirus and erroneous information about the death rate of the 2009 pandemic of H1N1.


Full Story 
Health officials around the world don’t yet know with certainty the death rate of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but some U.S. officials are currently estimating the disease is 10 times more fatal than the seasonal flu.
Posts circulating on Facebook, however, are erroneously dubbing the coronavirus the “least deadly virus” by spreading a chart homing in on fatality rates of other viruses. The chart was actually published in January, so it cites old data about coronavirus cases and deaths, and it contains an error that makes COVID-19 look less fatal than the 2009 H1N1 “swine flu” outbreak.
First, some context: While the World Health Organization has previously estimated the fatality rate of COVID-19 to be around 3.4%, that figure relies on known, confirmed cases of the disease — as we’ve previously written. The number very well may fall under 1%, as President Donald Trump has suggested, as more data about the total number of cases becomes available.
Still, an estimated 1% fatality rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, whose mortality rate is about 0.1% — a point Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed to Congress on March 11.
The misleading chart, however, would suggest the virus is not so harmful. One user sharing the post in a conspiracy theory group said the virus was the “least deadly” and “most-hyped by the media.” His post alone was then shared by more than 10,000 others.
The chart was first published in a Jan. 30 story on Business Insider attempting to convey how the novel coronavirus compared to previous outbreaks; it did not include the “least deadly virus” label.
The numbers of novel coronavirus cases and deaths in that original chart, now spreading on Facebook, are listed as 9,812 and 213 respectively; the fatality rate is listed as 3.2% (below the fatality rate of several other viruses included in the chart). Those figures for the coronavirus are now outdated. As of March 16, there have been more than 174,000 confirmed cases and more than 6,700 deaths.
Further, the chart contains wrong information about the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 and lists the death rate of that outbreak as 17.4%. Business Insider later corrected the chart to show that that outbreak had a 0.02% fatality rate — consistent with an estimate from a 2013 study analyzing the pandemic — and issued an editor’s note Feb. 4 alerting readers to that fact.
Shayanne Gal, the digital publication’s graphic designer who created the chart, confirmed as much to us, saying in an email that “the post on Facebook features an incorrect, outdated version of our chart.”
“We did not claim that the coronavirus is the ‘least deadly virus’, and of course we made sure to state that those were the numbers we had as of the time reported,” Gal said.
Business Insider’s corrected chart (using data as of Feb. 4) showed that COVID-19 has a higher death rate than H1N1, disproving the “least deadly virus” label being used on social media. And while the amended version relied on confirmed cases and deaths as of early February, putting the new coronavirus fatality rate at 2.1%, even the 1% estimate cited by Fauci is much higher than the H1N1 rate.
We’ve previously explained the differences between the two outbreaks and the fact the new coronavirus is significantly more transmissible, and more lethal, than H1N1.

153,Comedian Sam Hyde Not ‘Behind’ Spread of Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/comedian-sam-hyde-not-behind-spread-of-coronavirus/,,"25.7KQuick Take
A post on Facebook falsely claims comedian Sam Hyde is responsible for the spread of the new coronavirus. Researchers are still working to determine the source of this latest coronavirus, though evidence suggests it was first transmitted to humans from an animal.

Full Story
In late December, the World Health Organization learned that several patients in Wuhan, China had contracted pneumonia from a virus that did not match any known viruses. In early January, officials in China concluded that the virus was a new coronavirus, a group of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, known as MERS.
A post on Facebook makes the bogus claim that “authorities have identified that the international chemical-warfare terrorist ‘Samuel Whitcomb Hyde’ is behind the deadly China ‘coronavirus.'”
Sam Hyde is actually an actor, known for his work with sketch comedy group, “Million Dollar Extreme.” The group created a series called World Peace, which aired in 2016 on the channel Adult Swim, and was cancelled after being accused of promoting racism, sexism, and bigotry.
Hyde has been a target of other bogus internet conspiracy theories, usually involving mass shootings, as Forbes magazine documented in 2016. “If Twitter is to be believed, second-rate Internet comedian Sam Hyde is behind every nationally publicized shooting of the past year — that’s more than a dozen since last October,” the Forbes article said.
BuzzFeed produced a video last year that carried the headline: “Why ‘Sam Hyde’ Goes Viral After Every Mass Shooting.” It opens with CNN’s coverage of a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017, and Rep. Vincente Gonzalez of Texas mistakenly telling CNN that Hyde was the suspected shooter.
“Apparently, his name was released as Sam Hyde,” Gonzalez wrongly told CNN. “That was a name I was — I was given. We don’t know any more details.”
Gonzalez “fell for a long-running hoax,” as the New York Times explained at the time. Gonzalez’s office issued a statement that said he “deeply regrets” the error, the Times reported.
The latest hoax about Hyde also claims that the virus is spreading at an “unprecedented rate” and has “affected approximately 18 million people so far.” As of early Jan. 27, there had been nearly 2,900 confirmed cases globally and 81 reported deaths. So far, all of the deaths have been in China, with the vast majority of cases occurring in China. In the United States, there have been five confirmed cases, as of Jan. 27, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Officials are still working to determine how quickly the virus is spreading, and travel restrictions in Wuhan and surrounding cities have affected an estimated 50 million people.
As we’ve reported, the first cases of the new respiratory illness were linked to a fish market in Wuhan that also sold a variety of live animals. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Scientific American on Jan. 22 that the new virus “almost certainly” came from an animal. The virus, however, now shows signs of person-to-person spread, according to the CDC.

154,"Viral Post Misleads on COVID-19 Death Reporting, Vaccine Monitoring",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-viral-post-misleads-on-covid-19-death-reporting-vaccine-monitoring/,,"A tweet that migrated across social media platforms falsely suggests that any deaths in the 20 days following positive COVID-19 tests are to be attributed to the disease, “no matter what other factors were involved.” There is no such policy. And there’s also no evidence for the post’s suggestion that the vaccines are causing deaths that are being ignored.

COVID-19 is dangerous: The disease is estimated to have caused more than 579,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, and it can cause lingering health problems for some who get it. The COVID-19 vaccines now authorized for emergency use in the U.S., meanwhile, were found in clinical trials to be safe and effective at preventing symptomatic illness. Nearly 250 million doses have been administered thus far.
But a post circulating online distorts the facts to imply that COVID-19 deaths are inflated by a supposed mandate concerning positive COVID-19 tests. It also baselessly suggests that vaccines are causing deaths that are being ignored.

“Funny isn’t it, if you die within 20 days of testing positive for the Rona (no matter what other factors were involved) You’ll be counted as a COVID death,” the May 2 tweet reads. “However, if you drop dead within 24 hours of taking the vaccine it has nothing to do with it.”
One Instagram post of a screenshot of the tweet garnered more than 32,000 likes. Another earned more than 8,000 likes.
But there is no rule that those who “die within 20 days of testing positive” for COVID-19 are to be automatically classified as having died from the disease, “no matter what other factors were involved.”
We’ve previously addressed similar false claims surrounding COVID-19 death certificates and have explained that there is no federal law governing the death certificate process. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does provide guidance on certifying deaths, including some specific to COVID-19.
The CDC specifically advises that “COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.”
And there is no evidence that any state or local agencies have such a 20-day rule, either.
It’s possible that COVID-19 could be listed as a contributing factor to — but not the underlying cause of — a death in some cases. But at least 90% of death certificates citing COVID-19 to date list the disease as the underlying cause, or the illness that triggered the chain of events leading to the person’s death, according to CDC data available as of May 5.
It’s worth noting, in the context of the baseless implication that COVID-19 deaths are being systematically misreported, that excess death estimates further reinforce the toll of the pandemic. From March 2020 through the start of 2021, the U.S. experienced about 20% more deaths than would have been expected in the same time period, analyses show. The estimates are higher than the official COVID-19 death toll for that period; excess mortality can also capture indirect effects of the pandemic, such as people who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention.
The tweet’s suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are causing deaths that are not being investigated also doesn’t carry weight.
The U.S. government has several monitoring systems in place to track reports of adverse events — including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Patients and caregivers are asked to report “any clinically important medical event or health problem that occurs after vaccination” to VAERS, even if they’re not sure if it was a result of the vaccine.
The CDC and Food and Drug Administration review each case report of deaths that follow vaccination to determine whether they were caused by the vaccine. There has not been an established link for the overwhelming majority of the reports.
The FDA’s fact sheet for health care providers administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine now says that “a causal relationship” between the vaccine and rare cases involving both blood clots and low blood platelets “is plausible” based on the evidence available. The monitoring systems were used to identify those cases. As of May 4, there were 23 confirmed reports of people developing the condition after receiving the J&J vaccine, and at least three individuals have died. More than 8.4 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered.
Federal officials on April 13 recommended a brief pause on the J&J vaccine while the issue was investigated and, 10 days later, lifted the pause — saying that the “known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks.” Both the FDA and CDC now include warnings about the rare risk. The CDC says that “[w]omen younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event” with the J&J vaccine, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are “available for which this risk has not been seen.”

155,Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine Formulation Tweaked to Improve Stability,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-pfizer-biontechs-covid-19-vaccine-formulation-tweaked-to-improve-stability/,,"With the release of its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer switched the buffer used in its formulation to increase the stability of the product, allowing it to remain at refrigerator temperatures for longer. The Food and Drug Administration OK’d the change, which is also being made to some doses for teens and adults. Social media posts, however, misleadingly suggest that the ingredient swap is dangerous or was added to prevent heart attacks in children.

A minor change to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, done to make doses easier to store at warmer temperatures, is being misconstrued online as a safety hazard or as a sign that the vaccines are not safe for kids. There is no evidence to support either claim.
The ingredient in question is Tris, or tromethamine, which is used as a buffer in the children’s vaccine — and will soon be available in some adult and teen formulations as well — to keep doses at the correct pH, neither too acidic nor too basic. The original iteration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine used phosphate buffered saline, or PBS.
Pfizer and the FDA have said the switch was made to improve the stability of its mRNA vaccine, which previously had to be kept ultracold for long-term storage and lasted a month in a fridge once thawed; the newer version can last in the fridge for up to 10 weeks. Other experts back up that notion. 
Furthermore, Tris has safely been used in other vaccines and other products. 
Less stringent cold chain requirements are especially helpful for the pediatric vaccine, which is being administered more in doctor’s offices.
But social media posts have zeroed in on the formulation change to misleadingly suggest that Tris is dangerous — and simultaneously, that Tris was added to conceal cardiac side effects of the vaccine. 
Alex Jones’ Infowars, for example, falsely claims that tromethamine is a “heart attack drug” that was “secretly added” to the pediatric vaccine.
“Is Tris being added to these children’s vials to try to cover up the cardiovascular events that they cause, or at least minimize them?” suggestively asks an article from Natural News, another dubious website that has previously spread COVID-19 misinformation and has repeatedly been banned by Facebook.
Other posts, some subsequently shared on Instagram, make similarly suggestive claims, pointing out the switch to Tris and calling it a “disturbing nugget” “buried” in paperwork submitted to the FDA. They describe Tris as a “blood acid reducer which is used to stabilize people with heart attacks” and list a bunch of scary-sounding side effects, including respiratory depression and IV thrombosis.
Experts, however, say these claims are false or misleading. In large quantities, Tris can be used as a drug, but here, as in other vaccines and medicines, the compound is present in only a very small amount as an inactive ingredient to help keep the vaccine stable.
“It’s a really different use,” Dr. Kawsar R. Talaat, an infectious disease physician and vaccine scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told us of Tris being used therapeutically. “That’s put into somebody’s vein, it’s put in at larger concentrations. This is an infinitesimal amount of this buffer that goes into 0.2 milliliters of a vaccine just to keep the vaccine stable.”
According to FDA documents, each 0.2 milliliter pediatric dose contains 0.02 milligrams tromethamine and 0.13 milligrams of tromethamine hydrochloride.
Tris in vaccines, Talaat said, has “absolutely nothing to do” with Tris being given to people who are having heart attacks. In those situations, she said, individuals might not be getting enough oxygen, leading to acidosis, or an increase of acid, in the blood. That can then be countered with much larger volumes and higher concentrations of Tris than what is present in the vaccine.
The implication from some of the posts that Tris was added to reduce heart attacks in children is groundless. The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is not known to increase the risk of a heart attack in any population. Instead, the cardiac concern that has been identified for the two mRNA vaccines is an increased risk of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, or inflammation of the lining surrounding the heart, particularly in young men. But these adverse events are rare, and as a buffer, Tris would not be expected to modify the risk in either direction.
The idea that Tris is dangerous is also not supported. The FDA said in an email to FactCheck.org that the buffer is used in other approved vaccines, including those for dengue, smallpox and monkeypox, and Ebola. Tris is also used in the insulin Humalog and the autoimmune disease drug Enbrel, both of which are prescribed to children.
Also, contrary to many of the posts, the switch to Tris from PBS was not a secret, as it was noted in Pfizer and FDA documentation prior to authorization and was covered in the publicly streamed FDA advisory meeting. It was also mentioned in the FDA’s press release and press briefing announcing the agency’s decision to authorize the pediatric vaccine for kids 5 to 11 years old. Additionally, the ingredients are listed in agency vaccine fact sheets.
Pfizer has said that the buffer swap was done for improved stability and doesn’t change anything about the vaccine’s manufacturing.
“The manufacturing processes involved in producing the pediatric doses remain unchanged from the adult and adolescent doses. There are also no changes in raw materials, mRNA, lipids or suppliers in the manufacturing of the drug substance and lipid nanoparticles,” the company said in an email to us in response to an earlier inquiry about the claim (emphasis is Pfizer’s). “To enable extended storage time an alternative buffer is being leveraged, known as a ‘tris buffer’. Simply put, this allows the mRNA to resist being degraded for a longer period of time before administration — meaning the pediatric vaccine can be stored for 2-8°C [35.6-46.4°F] in commonly available refrigerators for up to 10 weeks. This buffer will also be used in the updated adult/adolescent 30mcg doses in due course, helping to ensure simplified handling of the vaccine across age groups.”
Andrew Geall, a co-founder and chief development officer of Replicate Bioscience, a biotech company focused on using self-replicating RNAs in vaccines and therapeutics, told us there is a logical basis for the buffer switch.
“I can tell you that PBS is a problem when you freeze it with RNA,” he said, citing his 13 years in the RNA vaccine field. “You see a huge drop in pH during that freezing process, and it impacts the stability of the RNA. And Tris does not have that, largely … it’s a much better buffer for these types of systems.”
While Geall said he had not seen data from Pfizer — and therefore his comments were speculative — he said it made sense that improved stability would be why the company swapped buffers. “It’s well known,” he said, of the challenges with PBS and the benefits of using Tris.
As for why Tris wasn’t used in the first place, as it was with Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, Geall said that wasn’t too surprising.
“Typically, in prototype formulations people will use phosphate buffered saline,” he said, since they aren’t being frozen much. “And then, at a later date, they start to do long-term stability studies, testing different buffers and pHs.”
Given the effort to get a COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible, Geall said, the company probably didn’t have time to work on optimizing the buffer, and moved forward with what they knew worked first, before returning to the issue.
As we’ve explained before, the pediatric clinical trials did not use the Tris formulation, but lab tests were performed to make sure the buffer change did not affect the shot’s safety or effectiveness.
These included analytical comparability tests showing that the size of the lipid nanoparticles, for example, wasn’t altered, and that the modified mRNA that acts as the active ingredient in the vaccine remained the same, according to the FDA. The agency has said the buffer exchange is “not considered clinically significant.”
Dr. H. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious disease at Tufts Children’s Hospital, and a member of the committee advising the FDA, also told us for an earlier article that he didn’t think the change in buffers would “make much of a difference at all.”
Talaat, who was an investigator at a trial site for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in adults and children, said the lack of clinical testing with this specific formulation was not worrisome.
“Formulations do change, and they don’t usually require clinical trials for minor changes like this,” she said. “We’re always trying to improve on things, and make them more stable and make them more functional.”
“I had no concern about this at all,” she added, saying that her 10-year-old got his first dose of the vaccine the first Saturday it was available. “I was so excited to give him the vaccine.”",Jessica McDonald,2021-11-19 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“And then, at a later date, they start to do long-term stability studies, testing different buffers and pHs.”

156,"Colin Powell’s COVID-19 Death Followed Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-colin-powells-covid-19-death-followed-cancer-diagnosis-treatment/,,"
Colin Powell’s family announced his death on Oct. 18 due to “complications from Covid 19.” Few details were immediately given, but the family noted that the former secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been fully vaccinated. 
Hours later, it emerged that Powell, who was 84 years old, had multiple myeloma, a rare blood cancer that weakens the immune system, increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and reduces vaccine effectiveness. 
He also had prostate cancer in 2003 and was being treated for early-stage Parkinson’s disease, according to his longtime assistant Peggy Cifrino.
Many people online nevertheless jumped on the news, erroneously concluding that Powell’s death was evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t work.
“Fully vaccinated, Colin Powell, is dead at 84 from covid. Trust the science!” reads one suggestive Facebook post that was shared more than 500 times.
“Colin Powell died from COVID and he was fully vaccinated. So what’s the point of the vaccine?” another person on Twitter asked.  
Fox News anchor John Roberts also chimed in on the platform, writing in a later-deleted tweet, “The fact that Colin Powell died from a breakthrough COVID infection raises new concerns about how effective vaccines are long-term.”
In a subsequent tweet that is also now deleted, Roberts said he deleted the tweet because “many people interpreted it as anti-vax,” adding that it was not and that he had encouraged people to be vaccinated and planned on getting a booster shot “as soon as possible.”
But rather than showing that COVID-19 vaccination does not work, experts say Powell’s death underscores the need for more people to be vaccinated to help protect not only themselves but also others, especially the most susceptible.
“The continued vulnerability of multiple myeloma patients (and many other immunocompromised patients) to severe COVID19 even after vaccination is one reason why it’s so essential for healthy individuals to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Alfred L. Garfall, a multiple myeloma expert at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, in a statement to FactCheck.org. “Even a mild infection in a healthy, unvaccinated person can transmit a fatal infection to a vaccinated, immunocompromised patient. The best way to protect our immunocompromised neighbors is for the general population to receive these remarkably safe and effective vaccines.”
Protecting the immunocompromised by getting vaccinated is also in the best interest of everyone, scientists say, because chronic infections in people with weakened immune systems may be one way new variants of the virus evolve. 
Powell served as a national security adviser for President Ronald Reagan, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and as secretary of state for George W. Bush. He was the first Black man to hold each position. He was also a four-star general in the U.S. Army. 
COVID-19 Vaccines Are Effective
Any single death from COVID-19 after vaccination — even a high-profile one — is not evidence that the vaccines don’t work. No vaccine is foolproof, and some number of breakthrough infections, even some leading to death, are expected. Vaccination greatly reduces the risk of infection and disease, but cannot eliminate it.
Data show that the vaccines are doing a remarkably good job at protecting people from infection, severe disease and death, including against the highly contagious delta variant.
According to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures, in the month of August, during which the delta variant accounted for nearly all infections, unvaccinated people were 6.1 times more likely to test positive for infection with the coronavirus and 11.3 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than the fully vaccinated.
While there is likely some waning vaccine immunity to infection, the bulk of evidence at this time shows that the vaccines remain highly protective against severe illness.
There is data, however, to suggest that some immunocompromised people — including those in treatment for blood cancers such as multiple myeloma — do not mount an effective immune response following the standard vaccination regimen, and that some fraction of them can benefit from an extra dose.
Based on this evidence, the Food and Drug Administration authorized a third booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines for these populations.
Powell received his second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in February, but had not yet gotten a booster. Cifrino told multiple news outlets that he was scheduled for one last week, but by that point he had already started to feel sick. 
Powell at Heightened Risk
Experts say Powell, as a multiple myeloma patient, was at higher risk of not responding effectively to the vaccine and of developing severe COVID-19 if infected.
“These patients have two strikes against them,” said Dr. Edward A. Stadtmauer, the section chief of hematologic malignancies at Penn Medicine, in a phone interview.
The cancer affects a particular type of B cell known as a plasma cell, which is a cell in the bone marrow that fights infections by churning out lots of protective antibodies. Multiple myeloma patients are therefore more susceptible to all sorts of infections because the uncontrolled growth of cancerous plasma cells crowds out other plasma cells that would otherwise spring into action once a person is infected.
“This is a disease by definition where patients are immunocompromised because the normal antibody-producing cells are abnormal,” Stadtmauer said.
On top of that, he said, the standard treatments for multiple myeloma suppress the immune system, since they target plasma cells but are not good at discriminating between healthy ones and the cancerous ones.
It is unclear what treatment Powell had received or was receiving, but the Washington Post reported that he “had been successfully treated … for two or three years,” according to Cifrino. 
Kathy Giusti, the founder of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, has said Powell was diagnosed in 2019 and told the New York Times that he “was undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma but seemed to be responding well.”
While not able to comment on Powell’s specific case, Stadtmauer said that even if a multiple myeloma patient is in remission, the likelihood that their immune system would be completely normal is “very low.”

“One of the hallmarks of the therapy of myeloma is more and more we give what we call continuous therapy … to continue to chip away at the last few abnormal cells in their system,” he said. “I certainly consider someone who has myeloma to be immunocompromised, really, for the rest of their lives.”
Fortunately, he said, the disease is increasingly treatable, but it remains incurable.
Preliminary research bears out the notion that multiple myeloma patients fare less well with COVID-19 than others.
An international survey of outcomes for 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, published in the journal Blood in December 2020, found that a high percentage of multiple myeloma patients hospitalized for COVID-19 died, ranging from 27% to 57%, depending on the country.
Other preliminary work also demonstrates that patients with multiple myeloma and other blood cancers are less likely to mount strong immune responses to vaccination.
Just 45% of 96 multiple myeloma patients with active disease developed an “adequate” antibody response to two doses of one of the mRNA vaccines, according to a paper published in the journal Leukemia in July, with 22% of such patients partially responding.
As that paper put it, “the same mechanisms that impede [multiple myeloma] patients’ ability to fend off infections also reduce their capability to generate immunity from vaccination.”
Other studies have found less drastic, but still concerning results. For example, a paper published in Cancer Cell in June found that 15.8% of the 260 patients with multiple myeloma failed to produce detectable coronavirus-specific antibodies following full vaccination — and that antibody levels in the rest of the patients could vary widely.
Another paper published in the same journal the following month found that 5% of the 184 patients with multiple myeloma did not produce coronavirus-specific antibodies following vaccination.
A limited study of 49 patients with various B cell malignancies also showed that while boosters can help some patients develop an antibody response, 35% did not make detectable antibodies even after the booster.
Stadtmauer said that in his clinic, about two-thirds of multiple myeloma patients produced coronavirus-specific antibodies after vaccination. That’s lower than the general population, he noted, but still a decent fraction of people — and all the more reason for them to be vaccinated.
“If there’s any group of patients who should get COVID vaccine and boosters and stay vigilant and seek medical attention early if they have symptoms consistent with COVID, it’s patients with myeloma,” he said.
In addition to myeloma, Powell’s advanced age and even his sex gave him higher odds of having a bad outcome. 
Figures from the CDC show that when serious breakthrough infections occur, they primarily involve older people and are more likely in males. Of the breakthrough infections reported to the agency by Oct. 12 in those who died, for example, 85% were in people 65 years of age and older and 57% were in males.
In recognition of the increased risk for older people, the FDA, in the last two months, authorized a third booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for people 65 years or older, along with other higher-risk groups.
A second Johnson & Johnson dose is also authorized for all adults, given evidence that the single-dose shot, while effective, is less so than either of the two-dose mRNA vaccines.

Fortunately, he said, the disease is increasingly treatable, but it remains incurable. Hours later, it emerged that Powell, who was 84 years old, had multiple myeloma, a rare blood cancer that weakens the immune system, increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and reduces vaccine effectiveness. “The continued vulnerability of multiple myeloma patients (and many other immunocompromised patients) to severe COVID19 even after vaccination is one reason why it’s so essential for healthy individuals to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Alfred L. Garfall, a multiple myeloma expert at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, in a statement to FactCheck.org. An international survey of outcomes for 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, published in the journal Blood in December 2020, found that a high percentage of multiple myeloma patients hospitalized for COVID-19 died, ranging from 27% to 57%, depending on the country."

The latest surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., driven by the delta variant of the virus that causes the disease, has pushed up the seven-day average of COVID-19 hospitalizations from 19,123 on June 15 to 80,664 on Aug. 15 — an increase of 322%.
The hospitalizations tend to be higher in states with low vaccination rates, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
But a misleading Instagram post questions the seriousness of the pandemic and its effect on hospitals. “If there were truly a pandemic that was ‘overwhelming hospitals,’ then hospitals wouldn’t be laying off thousands of nurses who refuse to take an experimental vaccine,” the post reads.
While some hospital staff have been fired for refusing to get the vaccine — notably at hospitals in Houston and New Jersey — the overall number dismissed for that reason is likely to be very small at this point, Colin Milligan, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association, told us in an email.
Milligan noted that many hospitals have deadlines in late August or September for complying with mandates or deadlines that are tied to full approval of the vaccines.
About 1,600 — a little more than a quarter — of all hospitals in the U.S. have some sort of vaccine mandate, Milligan said. “There really isn’t evidence that hospitals are shedding employees due to mandates,” he said.
Earlier in the pandemic, some health care providers were forced to tighten their budgets and reduce staff due to lower overall patient volume, canceled elective procedures and higher expenses tied to the pandemic — not because COVID-19 isn’t real, as the post suggests.
But Milligan noted that Bureau of Labor Statistics data show hospital employment has actually ticked up slightly by 11,000 jobs from January to July. Although still below the pre-pandemic high in February 2020, hospital employment was up 45,200 jobs in July compared with a year ago, BLS data show.
The pandemic continues to put a severe financial strain on hospitals, however. More than 260 hospitals furloughed employees and at least 20 others laid off workers over the last year, according to Becker’s Hospital Review, a medical trade publication.
A March report by the consulting service Kaufman Hall & Associates indicated that the number of hospitals operating in the red is likely to increase throughout the year and the financial health of rural hospitals will be significantly affected by the fallout of the pandemic.
“We have not bounced back in terms of maintaining financial stability,” Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association, said when the report was released. “And — just as importantly — we are being set back in our ability to care for the sick, injured and keeping people healthy.”
At hospitals hit hardest, doctors and nurses have been dealing with a flood of unvaccinated patients and are “no longer giving adequate care to patients,” Dr. Catherine O’Neal, the chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said at an Aug. 2 press conference.
On Aug. 17, the Florida Hospital Association reported more than 16,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations, a 162% increase from the previous peak on July 23, 2020.
“There can be no question that many Florida hospitals are stretched to their absolute limits,” Mary Mayhew, president of the Florida Hospital Association, said in an Aug. 17 press release, noting that “staff shortages” are compounding the problem. “While hospitalizations continue to increase, three out of four Florida hospitals expect to face critical staff shortages in the next seven days, an increase of nearly ten percent since last week, and half of our hospitals will no longer accept transfer patients from other facilities.”",Sean Carlin,2021-08-18 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“And — just as importantly — we are being set back in our ability to care for the sick, injured and keeping people healthy.”

158,Anti-Vaccine Posts Use Deceptively Edited Video Clip,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/anti-vaccine-posts-use-deceptively-edited-video-clip/,,"Quick Take
Social media pages that share anti-vaccine messages have used a selectively edited news clip that suggests the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe. The clip shows a nurse fainting after she gets the vaccine, but it doesn’t show her quick recovery afterward when she explains that she is prone to fainting when triggered by even a slight pain.

Full Story
Facebook posts fueling suspicion of the COVID-19 vaccine have appropriated a news clip showing one of the first nurses in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to get the shot.
A local NBC affiliate filmed the first vaccinations as they were administered at CHI Memorial Hospital there on Dec. 17. One of the six health care workers to receive the vaccine during that publicity event was Tiffany Dover, a nurse in the hospital’s critical care unit.
“It’s been a hard time,” Dover said about the pandemic. “We’ve persevered through it, but I think that this vaccination offers us hope.”
After getting the shot, Dover began to feel lightheaded and then passed out, which was shown in the news clip.
Shortly afterward, she explained to the TV reporter, “I have a history of having an overactive vagal response and, so, with that, if I have pain from anything — hang nail or I stub my toe — I can just pass out.”
Dover reported that she was “feeling fine” after her fainting episode. “The pain in my arm is very minimal, actually, but it doesn’t take much,” she said, estimating that she has fainted “six times in the last six weeks.”
The hospital issued a statement the following day quoting Dr. Jesse Tucker saying, “The fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition.”
An “overactive vagal response” basically means that nerves controlling heartbeat and blood pressure send the wrong signal — slowing the heart while expanding blood vessels — and blood pools in the legs, so the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen. This response is often triggered by pain and causes a person to faint.
It’s “quite common,” according to a description from Cedars-Sinai, which explained that the condition “most often affects children and young adults, but it can happen at any age.”
Fainting can also happen after any kind of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It has most commonly been reported in relation to three vaccines given to adolescents — HPV, MCV4 and Tdap, according to the CDC’s website. Those vaccines contain different ingredients, so “scientists think that fainting is due to the vaccination process and not to the vaccines themselves,” the website says.
“Fainting itself is generally not serious, but harm from related falls or other accidents can cause injury,” according to the CDC. “The main concern is head injury.”
The CDC recommends that those administering the COVID-19 vaccine observe patients for 15 minutes afterward to safeguard against injuries from fainting.
But none of that information is conveyed in the Facebook posts that show Dover fainting.
Instead, those posts include captions that falsely suggest there’s something unsafe about the vaccine.
“CCU Manager passes out mid-live broadcast after receiving the COVE idD Vackseen,” was the caption accompanying a version of the clip that racked up hundreds of thousands of views in less than 24 hours on a page that frequently posts anti-vaccine messages.
Another account that has a history of anti-vaccine messages said: “Watch this nurse pass out after receiving the COVID vaccine. It’s so safe though, right? Why do people continue to follow these rabid dictators?”
As we’ve written before, no serious safety concerns have been reported regarding the currently available COVID-19 vaccine, although some health care workers who have taken the vaccine have had allergic reactions. (See “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine“ and “Q&A on COVID-19 Vaccines” for more.)
Further information about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine is available from the CDC.
Update, Jan. 4: Since publishing this item, social media posts have falsely claimed that Tiffany Dover has died. A spokeswoman for CHI Memorial Hospital told Reuters on Dec. 28 that such claims are false.

159,Painting of Children in Masks Isn’t a 1994 Airport Mural,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/painting-of-children-in-masks-isnt-a-1994-airport-mural/,,"Quick Take
Viral posts wrongly claim that a painting depicting children in face masks was created as a mural for the Denver airport in 1994 — and baselessly suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. The painting is not at the airport, and is not from 1994.


Full Story 
Facebook and Twitter posts are spreading an image of a pandemic-themed painting with a false claim about when it was made and where it appears.
Specifically, the posts claim that the artwork — depicting children wearing face masks that represent the flags of different countries — was created as a mural for the Denver International Airport in 1994. The erroneous posts now circulating use the painting to baselessly suggest that the pandemic was planned 26 years ago.
“The Denver airport mural painted in 1994,” the posts read. “Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?”
But the painting does not appear in a listing of the Denver airport’s public art available on the airport’s website, and a spokesperson for the airport confirmed to us that the image on social media is “not from DEN’s art collection.” The claims tying the painting to the airport seem to have surfaced only recently.
There is an airport mural created in 1994 that illustrates children from around the world. It’s called “Children of the World Dream of Peace,” but it doesn’t include face masks. (The airport and its art have been the subject of conspiracy theories in the past.)
As for the painting involving face masks circulating on social media, we found images of the artwork as early as February, attributing it to an artist in the Philippines named CJ Trinidad.
In late February, CNN Philippines shared a photo of the painting — posted by Trinidad days earlier — on its official Facebook page. Trinidad had dubbed the piece “Maskcommunication.”
Trinidad can also be seen posing with the painting in a photo uploaded in March. He also recently shared a photo on Instagram showing what he described as the making of the painting.
But the same work has surfaced elsewhere online with a different attribution.
It was submitted to a recent international art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, “United Against Corona- Express through Art,” by an India-based artist named Neha Kumari.
 
The competition website lists the “[d]ate of submission” as Dec. 28, 1995, but that appears to be an error: The ICCR accepted submissions from April 2, 2020, to May 1, 2020. 
The photo of the work on the ICCR website appears to be the same image shared by Trinidad, then by CNN, in February — though cropped tighter. A key difference between the photos is the name of the artists on each painting.
In the photo posted by Trinidad, his name appears at the bottom of the painting. The picture on the ICCR art competition website, however, does not show that bottom area of the painting. Instead, the name “NEHA” appears in the top left corner of the painting.
We reached out to the ICCR and to Trinidad about the conflicting claims of who created the painting — and we’ll update this story if we hear back.
Either way, though, we could find no evidence to suggest the painting was created in 1994 — and it’s false to say that it’s a mural in the Denver airport.

160,Biden Adviser Didn’t Propose Requiring COVID-19 Vaccine for Food Stamps,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/biden-adviser-didnt-propose-requiring-covid-19-vaccine-for-food-stamps/,,"Quick Take
A report from two dozen experts — including a doctor named to President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory board — recommended using existing social service programs to connect people with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The report did not advise requiring vaccination in order to receive such services, as social media posts falsely claim.

Full Story
When a COVID-19 vaccine is approved and ready, health officials will need to coordinate its distribution to hundreds of millions of people and help the public overcome misperceptions.
Dubious websites and social media posts, however, are spreading a falsehood about a report outlining distribution strategies, wrongly accusing a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 advisory team of wanting to mandate vaccination by tying it to food assistance.
On Instagram, users shared screenshots of a Nov. 12 headline from the website Natural News, falsely claiming, “VAX THE BLACKS: Joe Biden’s Covid-19 taskforce member recommends withholding food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.”
Natural News was banned by Facebook earlier this year for using foreign trolls to spread its unreliable content.
The vaccine story, which also appeared on an affiliated website called Distributed News, specifically says that Dr. Luciana Borio, recently named a member of Biden’s Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board, “says that people who refuse to be vaccinated should be deprived of food stamps and rent assistance.”
That is false.

The story offers a distorted take on one part of a July report published by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security — “The Public’s Role in COVID-19 Vaccination: Planning Recommendations Informed by Design Thinking and the Social, Behavioral, and Communication Sciences.” The report was the result of a working group of about two dozen experts, including Borio.
The report did not recommend that vaccine “mandates” be tied to social service programs, such as food stamps and rent assistance, as the Natural News story claims.
Instead, one of the report’s recommendations is to “Make Vaccination Available in Safe, Familiar, and Convenient Places.” The report explains that making vaccines widely available will “entail local and state health departments’ developing vaccination capacity, creating local adaptations to meet communities — and, particularly, vulnerable populations — where they are, and communicating timely information in clear and accessible ways.”
One corresponding action item says this:
Local and state public health agencies should explore collaboration with interagency and nongovernment partners to bundle vaccination with other safety net services. For example, the WIC nutrition program serves as a key mechanism for connecting low-income pregnant women with nutrition supports and clinical services, and immunization screenings and vaccine promotion are built into the WIC program. Bundling services (eg, food security, rent assistance, free clinic services) that are already being provided to particularly vulnerable populations in the context of COVID (eg, older adults, low-income adults, Black and minority communities) could be a way to build trust and streamline vaccine provision. Early, rapid-response, community-based research (Recommendation #4) can help broaden planners’ understanding of how the intended beneficiaries of vaccines think about where these products fit into their lives overall, based on their own definitions of health and well-being.
In a statement provided to us in response to the viral story, Dr. Monica Schoch-Spana and Emily K. Brunson, the lead authors of the Johns Hopkins report, said that they “do NOT advocate that such social supports ever be withheld in connection with an individual’s vaccination status.”
The statement said the viral story contained “factual inaccuracies and misleading statements” about the report’s recommendations, and that the authors “take exception to the singling out and professional misrepresentation” of Borio.
“We support voluntary vaccination during the pandemic, once safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should NOT be mandated,” the statement added. “We do advocate the provision of timely, accurate, and meaningful information so that individuals can make well-informed decisions about whether or not to accept vaccination for themselves or dependents in their care.”
Schoch-Spana and Brunson further said they “support efforts to make SARS-CoV-2 vaccines readily available to everyone who wants one, including individuals with limited means.” One way to do that is to provide the vaccines “at places where these individuals already go such as WIC clinics and food banks,” they said.

161,Why It’s Easy to Misinterpret Numbers of Deaths Among the Vaccinated,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-why-its-easy-to-misinterpret-numbers-of-deaths-among-the-vaccinated/,,"Raw numbers of hospitalizations or deaths among those who are vaccinated are not a good indicator of whether vaccines are effective. If the large majority of a population is vaccinated, it’s not surprising if most deaths are among the vaccinated. But social media posts misuse data from the U.K. to suggest the COVID-19 vaccines don’t work.

Epidemiologists and biostatistics experts have been cautioning that as more and more of a population gets vaccinated, we’ll likely see more deaths from COVID-19 among the vaccinated. It’s simply math. The vaccines aren’t 100% effective — no vaccine is — so some deaths are expected. And if there are relatively few people still unvaccinated, the raw numbers of deaths are likely to show more deaths among the vaccinated.
“Consider the hypothetical world where absolutely everyone had received a less than perfect vaccine. Although the death rate would be low, everyone who died would have been fully vaccinated,” David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, and Anthony Masters, statistical ambassador for the Royal Statistical Society, wrote in late June for a story published in the London-based Guardian.
The headline on that piece: “Why most people who now die with Covid in England have had a vaccination.” Spiegelhalter and Masters cautioned: “Don’t think of this as a bad sign, it’s exactly what’s expected from an effective but imperfect jab.”
Yet, months later, misleading social media posts are highlighting data from the U.K., suggesting the numbers of deaths show something is wrong.
“BE IN THE KNOW: the vast majority of people (7 out of 10) who died from the COVID-19 virus in the UK were fully vaccinated,” one Facebook post reads, accompanied by a clip of Alex Berenson citing the data on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast on Oct. 12. Berenson, an author and former New York Times reporter, has been banned from Twitter for violating its rules on COVID-19 misinformation. We wrote about one of his tweets on the COVID-19 vaccines earlier this year. In the Facebook clip, Berenson correctly cites the U.K. numbers but presents them as something surprising.
“And I have to keep saying this to people because they almost don’t believe it. In the U.K. 70-plus percent of the people who die now from COVID are fully vaccinated,” Berenson said. “It’s not a conspiracy theory. It’s not somebody saying, Oh, I heard this from my cousin. It’s in British government document from the U.K. Public Health England.”
The 70% figure is correct. But again, those are raw numbers, among a highly vaccinated population. In its week 38 report, Public Health England — which has been replaced by the UK Health Security Agency — reported there were 3,158 deaths from COVID-19 from Aug. 23 through Sept. 19 and 2,284 of those individuals (72.3%) had received their second vaccine shot at least 14 days earlier. However, the same report shows vaccination rates approaching or exceeding 90% for age groups 60 and older, the group that accounts for 86.5% of all deaths in that time period.
Overall, 77.3% of the U.K. population 12 and older had received two shots by Sept. 19.
The same chart showing those death figures (see Table 4), shows the rates of death are higher among the unvaccinated than for the vaccinated. The death rate is calculated by comparing the number of deaths for vaccinated or unvaccinated people with the total population of each group.
The death rates for the unvaccinated are three to five times higher than the rates for the vaccinated among the 60-and-over age groups.


Source: “COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report – week 38,” Public Health England; Death rates for fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals in the U.K. for Aug. 23 through Sept. 19, 2021.
 
In the full three-hour podcast, Berenson acknowledges that the death rates indicate the vaccines provide protection, saying “what they’re showing you there is that even though the vast majority of people who died, were vaccinated, the vaccine still appears to have some protective effect.” But that acknowledgment is missing from the shorter clip circulating on Facebook; other social media and online posts misleadingly highlight the U.K. raw numbers of deaths, with some including similar data from other countries.
“As the number of people vaccinated in a population grows, we expect to see relatively more deaths in the vaccinated. This ‘base rate’ phenomenon can make it hard to interpret the data,” Natalie Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, told us via email. “It doesn’t mean the vaccines aren’t working well against deaths (they are) but just that the vast majority of vulnerable adults in the UK have been vaccinated.”
We’ve written about this issue twice before, including when social media posts misinterpreted figures on a COVID-19 outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
“Epidemiologists never look at raw number of cases if we want to think about anything causal, because they don’t tell us what we want to know. We need to know the denominator too,” Matthew Fox, professor in the Departments of Epidemiology and Global Health at Boston University, told us via email. “Imagine if everyone in a population of 1 million people was vaccinated and there were 100 deaths. Every single one of them was vaccinated, but without a comparison population who were unvaccinated, we can’t say if the vaccine protected people because we don’t know how many people would have died if they all hadn’t been vaccinated.”
For a visual representation of this, see this blog post by Wake Forest University statistician Lucy D’Agostino McGowan.
Fox said the death rates for the vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations are the better measure, but even those are imperfect because of other factors in those groups. For instance, a greater proportion of the vaccinated group may be sicker individuals or those at greater risk of severe illness who had a strong motivation to get vaccinated.
The U.K. reports on these figures warn about misinterpretation, echoing what experts told us.

“In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. This is especially true because vaccination has been prioritised in individuals who are more susceptible or more at risk of severe disease,” the week 38 report says.
The report includes estimates on vaccine effectiveness, which come from comparing rates among the vaccinated and unvaccinated and using community testing data, vaccination data, cohort studies and electronic health data. The observed effectiveness against symptomatic disease with the delta variant after two vaccine doses was about 65% to 70% with the AstraZeneca vaccine (which hasn’t been authorized in the United States) and 80% to 95% with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. “Vaccine effectiveness is generally slightly higher in younger compared to older age groups,” the report said.
Effectiveness against hospitalization and death was more than 90% for all three vaccines. “Relatively limited waning of protection against mortality is seen over a period of at least 5 months,” the U.K. report said.
Overall, the figures for the seven-day average of new deaths from COVID-19 in the U.K. are a fraction of what they were at the peak in late January, or even the high figures from April and May 2020, early in the pandemic. The seven-day rolling average was 1,248 deaths per day on Jan. 23, and it was 135 on Oct. 25, according to U.K. figures compiled by Our World in Data.

Our fact-checking colleagues across the pond at Full Fact wrote about another data point Berenson highlighted in that podcast, and which has been circulating to a lesser degree on social media: The U.K. report shows higher rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases for those in older age groups among the vaccinated compared with the unvaccinated.
The week 38 report showed those ages 40 and up who were vaccinated had higher rates of cases than the unvaccinated in the same age groups, while the week 43 report (for the four weeks ending Oct. 24) showed higher confirmed case rates for those 30 and older. Why would this be the case? For one, people have to get tested in order to have a confirmed case, so case numbers aren’t exact.
“The case rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are unadjusted crude rates that do not take into account underlying statistical biases in the data,” the U.K. week 43 report says. “There are likely to be systematic differences in who chooses to be tested and the COVID risk of people who are vaccinated.”
It goes on to say that fully vaccinated people may be more likely to get tested and more likely to have “social interactions because of their vaccination status,” leading to greater exposure to possible infection. Plus, COVID-19 infections among the unvaccinated in the prior four-week reporting period may be “artificially reducing” the case rate for that group in the latest report.
Full Fact also raised the issue of which official population figures are used for the total number of unvaccinated people. Since the unvaccinated make up a relatively small percentage of those in older age groups, even a small change in the estimate for the population of this group could throw off these rates.
Dean at Emory University raised the same point about the likelihood of getting tested. “People who are vaccinated may be more likely to seek routine testing or testing for mild symptoms. Their infections may be captured more often than infections in the unvaccinated,” she said. “This is more of a challenge for studying very mild disease. In contrast, severe disease is well-captured and not subject to these same biases.”
Also, Dean said there is “some waning of effectiveness against infection over time, so this may be more prominent” in the older age groups as opposed to the 18-29 age group who may have been vaccinated more recently. There has been “a drop off in effectiveness against all infections due to waning and the delta variant,” she said.
As we explained last month, multiple studies have found a reduction in real-world effectiveness against confirmed infections, though effectiveness against severe disease and death have remained robust. Those studies led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend booster vaccine shots for some individuals.
Clarification, Nov. 3: We added the time frame to the chart source information.  ",Lori Robertson,2021-11-01 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"In the full three-hour podcast, Berenson acknowledges that the death rates indicate the vaccines provide protection, saying “what they’re showing you there is that even though the vast majority of people who died, were vaccinated, the vaccine still appears to have some protective effect.” But that acknowledgment is missing from the shorter clip circulating on Facebook; other social media and online posts misleadingly highlight the U.K. raw numbers of deaths, with some including similar data from other countries. The headline on that piece: “Why most people who now die with Covid in England have had a vaccination.” Spiegelhalter and Masters cautioned: “Don’t think of this as a bad sign, it’s exactly what’s expected from an effective but imperfect jab.”
Yet, months later, misleading social media posts are highlighting data from the U.K., suggesting the numbers of deaths show something is wrong. Although the death rate would be low, everyone who died would have been fully vaccinated,” David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, and Anthony Masters, statistical ambassador for the Royal Statistical Society, wrote in late June for a story published in the London-based Guardian. “In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. Every single one of them was vaccinated, but without a comparison population who were unvaccinated, we can’t say if the vaccine protected people because we don’t know how many people would have died if they all hadn’t been vaccinated.”

162,Trump Again Overstates Speed of COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trump-again-overstates-speed-of-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/,,"Contradicting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director and other government officials, President Donald Trump incorrectly said in a press briefing that a coronavirus vaccine would be “immediately” available to the general public after an authorization.
Officials expect only a limited number of doses will be available in 2020 — and those will be given to prioritized groups. Members of the general public may not be able to receive a shot until well into 2021.
The president also claimed, without evidence, that the U.S. would “be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020.”
Trump made his remarks in a Sept. 16 press briefing. Earlier in the day, Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC, testified before the Senate, explaining the phased rollout.
Redfield, Sept. 16: I think there will be vaccine [that’ll] initially be available sometime between November and December, but very limited supply and will have to be prioritized. If you’re asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we’re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter 2021.
When asked about Redfield’s comments, Trump said Redfield was mistaken and may have been confused by the question.
“I think he made a mistake when he said that. It’s just incorrect information,” Trump said. “No, we’re ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced, and it could be announced in October. It could be announced a little bit after October. But once we go, we’re ready.”
Later, when pressed on when the vaccine would be available to the general public, Trump incorrectly said that it would be available “immediately.”
Trump, Sept. 16: I would say that — yeah, we will start distributing it immediately.
Reporter: But to the general public.
Trump: To the general public, very shortly there — I mean, really, to the general public: immediately. When we go, we go. We’re not looking to say, “Gee, in six months, we’re going to start giving it to the general public.” No, we want to go immediately. No, it was an incorrect statement.
The president insisted that “it’s going to be a much faster distribution than” Redfield said.
“Our distribution is going to be very rapid and very — it’s going to be all-encompassing,” he said. “We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems — senior citizens, et cetera — but it’s a very powerful — it’s a — it’s going to be very powerful distribution. It’s going to cover everybody, and it’s going to cover them rapidly.”
Trump also moved up the timeline for distribution beyond what any expert or official has previously suggested, indicating a possible start as early as mid-October.
“We’re on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner,” he said. “We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we’ll be able to start. That’ll be from mid-October on. It may be a little bit later than that, but we’ll be all set.”
As we have written, experts are doubtful that the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials will have progressed enough to be able to conclude a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of October or early November, let alone begin distribution.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a Sept. 8 interview that having an answer on a vaccine was “unlikely” by Election Day, and that a more reasonable expectation would be by the end of the year.
Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed — the government’s effort to fast-track vaccine development — said on Sept. 3 that there was a “very, very low chance” that the trials would provide results by the end of October.
Three vaccine makers have started conducting large, placebo-controlled randomized trials of their coronavirus vaccines in the U.S. 
Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine trial is the most advanced, with more than 29,000 enrollees out of a goal of 30,000, as of Sept. 14. Moderna’s trial, which is also testing an mRNA vaccine, is close behind, with more than 25,000 enrollees as of Sept. 16. AstraZeneca’s viral vector vaccine trial was halted after the identification of a possible serious adverse effect in a participant who received the vaccine. The trial has resumed in the U.K. but remains on hold in the U.S. 
The CEO of Pfizer has stated that his company anticipates that it will know whether its vaccine works by the end of October, but that it “is only a prediction” and “only an answer.” Some scientists are skeptical of such a fast turnaround. 
Moderna told CNBC on Sept. 17 that it expects to know an answer on its vaccine in November — and that while one could come in October, it would be unlikely.
Once a company believes it has enough data to justify an authorization, it would need to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration and the agency would have to review it. The authorization could be as fast as a few days if the data are unambiguous. 
Once approved, likely as an emergency use authorization, or EUA, any already produced vaccines would then need to be shipped out. The logistics head of Operation Warp Speed has said vaccines would begin to move to administration sites within 24 hours of the FDA’s decision.
Although that timeline is rapid, it still involves extra days, and makes it even more improbable that vaccine distribution and delivery would occur in October, even if everything goes along without a hitch and a trial does provide results at the end of that month.
As one sign of a reasonable timeline, the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination interim playbook, which the president held up during the presser, doesn’t require states seeking grant funds to even submit their COVID-19 vaccination plans to the agency until Oct. 16.
Perhaps most important, Trump misleads by saying that the distribution plan would get shots to the general public “immediately” — and much faster than Redfield suggested.
Some news outlets reported that the CDC issued a statement clarifying that Redfield’s estimates were for when Americans could expect to have completed their vaccinations, not when doses would first be available. Other news organizations said that the agency later retracted the statement.
Regardless, Redfield’s description is consistent with what other officials have said and jibes with the tiered approach the government has proposed.
“We may have enough vaccine by the end of the year to immunize probably, I would say, between 20 and 25 million people,” Operation Warp Speed’s Slaoui told NPR earlier this month. “And then we will ramp up the manufacturing of vaccine doses to be able to, based on our plans, have enough vaccine to immunize the U.S. population by the middle of 2021.”
In July 31 Senate testimony, Fauci cautioned that the vaccine would be limited at first. 
“I don’t think that … we will have everybody getting it immediately in the beginning, it probably will be phased in. And that’s the reason why we have the committees to do the prioritization of who should get it first,” Fauci said. “But ultimately, within a reasonable period of time, the plans now allow for any American who needs a vaccine to get it within the year 2021.”
The CDC playbook also explains that the vaccine supply will initially be constrained — and that the general public will not have immediate access.
“A key point to consider is that vaccine supply will be limited at the beginning of the program, so the allocation of doses must focus on vaccination providers and settings for vaccination of limited critical populations as well as outreach to these populations,” the playbook reads. “The vaccine supply is projected to increase quickly over the proceeding months, allowing vaccination efforts to be expanded to additional critical populations and the general public.”
The document includes tentative scenarios noting that if both vaccines A and B — references to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — were authorized under an EUA, only about 3 million doses, or enough for 1.5 million people to get two doses, would be available by the end of October. By the end of November, the number of cumulative doses could rise to 20 million to 30 million and 35 million to 45 million by the end of December.
Those numbers would mean only a fraction of those prioritized would be able to be vaccinated in 2020, assuming there is a vaccine. Although it’s not known yet exactly which groups will be prioritized — that will be determined only after there is vaccine data — some of the first groups are likely to include health care workers as well as adults with underlying conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 and older individuals who live in places such as nursing homes. 
August meeting slides from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which will provide guidance on which groups should get first dibs, estimate that there are 17 million to 20 million health care workers in the U.S. and some 3 million seniors in long-term care facilities, along with as many as 100 million adults with underlying health conditions.
100 Million Doses?
Notably, neither Slaoui’s estimates nor the CDC numbers fit with Trump’s other claim that “we’ll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020.”
The Department of Health and Human Services issued a press release the same day as Trump’s remarks and quoted Redfield as using the number, but in a different context. “Through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, CDC will play a vital role in deciding, based on input from experts and stakeholders, how initial, limited vaccine doses will be allocated and distributed while reliably producing more than 100 million doses by January 2021,” he said.
But having 100 million doses produced by January is different from having those doses distributed by the close of 2020 — and distribution assumes the vaccine is approved, which is still unknown. Neither HHS nor the White House responded to our inquiry asking about the dose projection.
Pfizer’s website says that if its vaccine receives authorization, the company expects “to manufacture globally up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.” Since it’s a global number, that again suggests 100 million doses would not be available to Americans before the year ends. 
The company declined to provide more specific information about its dose number and timeline in the U.S., although the CEO said on Sept. 13 that Pfizer had already manufactured “hundreds of thousands of doses.”

An image spreading widely on social media shows a woman holding the French flag behind her, with throngs of people filling the street below. It captures a celebration in Paris following France’s victory in the 2018 World Cup final.
But social media users now are misrepresenting that photo to suggest it was taken recently at a protest against COVID-19 vaccines.
“France today,” reads a tweet from July 18. “People are waking up against vaccine tyranny and new world order!”
The photo appeared the same day in a post on Telegram with the same text.
Another tweet of the photo on July 18 — shared nearly 2,000 times — was paired with a more implicit message: “‘They say 2 million people took to the streets of Paris’ Shit’s getting real folks – do you want to be on the side of good or evil for this one?”
On Facebook, a user shared the photo and declared, “Yeah, that’s right Millions of people are awake, MILLIONS. Go FRANCE and anyone who isn’t complying to the trash mind control.” More than 250 users shared the post.
The photo also appeared on Instagram with a message against the vaccines in a post liked nearly 600 times. The user said she had “no way of proving this photo is real but it’s supposedly from France.”
There have indeed been well-attended protests in France against COVID-19 vaccines, with some opposing a measure by the government that will require individuals to show proof of vaccination — or a negative COVID-19 test or recent recovery from the disease — in order to enter public events or venues.
Reverse image searches, however, show the photo circulating on social media with anti-vaccine messages is not from such a protest — but from a July 15, 2018, World Cup celebration.

164,Trump’s Snowballing China Travel Claim,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-snowballing-china-travel-claim/,,"In early March, President Donald Trump said that restrictions he placed on travel to and from China “saved a lot of lives,” a claim that grew to “probably tens of thousands” and “hundreds of thousands” by early April. But we found no support for such figures.
The few studies that have been done estimate the U.S.’ and other countries’ travel restrictions regarding China had modest impacts, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic. We didn’t find a study that looked at the U.S. restrictions alone, and we found only one non-peer-reviewed study, on Australia, that found an impact of such policies on deaths, though it has significant limitations. 
Past studies, too, have found international travel restrictions could delay the path of the spread of diseases but do little to contain them.
Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told us he hasn’t seen any evidence to support the president’s claims. Previous studies of viruses with a reproduction number of 1.9 or higher, meaning the average number of other people one person infects, have shown the restrictions have to be very strict to have an effect, he said. Travel restrictions “can have an impact if you shut down 90% of all travel,” Omer said. But, “even then, it delays it a little bit but it doesn’t stop it.”
Omer co-authored a Feb. 3 article on why a travel ban wouldn’t stop the coronavirus.
Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, looked at several of the same studies we examined and concluded that “by themselves, travel restrictions do little but delay the onset of a crisis mentality and shift the curve to the right rather than flattening it.”

As we have found with prior claims from the president, Trump’s assertions have progressively grown:
Trump, March 5, Fox News town hall: But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, “What’s going on with China? How many people are coming in?” … [Y]ou both know that I closed the borders very early. …. You know, it saved a lot of lives.
Trump, March 17, coronavirus task force briefing: We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early. Very, very early. Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that’s going to be — that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.
Trump, March 24, Fox News virtual town hall: I made a decision to close off to China. … Thousands and thousands of more people — probably tens of thousands would be dead right now if I didn’t make that decision.
Trump, April 7, task force briefing: And I was called all sorts of names when I closed it down to China. …. If I didn’t do it — if I didn’t do that, we would’ve had hundreds of thousands more people dying.
We asked the White House for support for the president’s claims, specifically whether there was support for his claims of “tens of thousands” or “hundreds of thousands” of lives saved. We haven’t received a response.
On Jan. 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. As of that date, there were nine confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S., though there had been very little testing. At that point, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not yet sent test kits to public health labs, so all testing was done through the CDC.
Currently, the U.S. has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world. As of April 10, the U.S. had more than 486,000 cases and nearly 18,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
Under the travel restrictions, non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, were prohibited from entering the U.S. if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks.
Research on the Coronavirus Travel Restrictions
As we’ve written before, a study published in the journal Science on March 6 estimated that travel restrictions instituted in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and those put in place by several countries in early February regarding China would “only modestly” affect the spread of the pandemic.
The researchers — a team from the U.S., Italy and China, led by Northeastern University in Boston — used a model to estimate the impact. The model showed that a travel ban in Wuhan “was initially effective at reducing international case importations,” but “the number of cases observed outside Mainland China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere.” It found that restrictions by other countries would have “a modest effect” if they reduced travel to and from China by up to 90%, unless those restrictions were “paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility.”
In other words, travel restrictions could delay, but not stop, the spread of the disease, and social distancing and hand-washing behaviors would reduce the transmission of the disease.
Another study published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences similarly found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries “likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.”
The researchers, mostly with the Yale School of Public Health, said that “rapid contact tracing” was “essential” to limit person-to-person spread.
The study did find that the travel lockdowns put in place in Wuhan and Hubei province lowered the daily rate of exportation of cases from China by 81.3% on average by Feb. 15. “At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response,” the study said.
The study also found that airport screening “has only a moderate benefit” early in the epidemic, as most people — 64% — travel during the incubation period, before exhibiting symptoms.
The study, which relied on data on the outbreak in China and airline network data to make its estimates, concluded that travel restriction measures are “unlikely to contain the outbreak,” but they could delay the importation of cases, providing time for unaffected areas to prepare a public health response.
A third recent study, by researchers in China, the U.S. and the U.K., looked at both the travel restrictions and other emergency measures put in place in China only, estimating that shutting down Wuhan slowed the virus’ spread to other cities in China by 2.91 days.
The study, which was published in Science on March 31, concluded that the delay “provided extra time to prepare for the arrival of COVID-19 in more than 130 cities across China but would not have curbed transmission after infection had been exported to new locations from Wuhan.”
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has praised Trump’s travel restrictions on China, saying the U.S. has dealt with a lower number of cases because of the policies. At a press conference on Feb. 29, Fauci said, “If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.”
The studies we cited suggest that the travel restrictions could have slowed down, but not stopped, the importation of COVID-19 in the U.S. But when we looked into this issue in early March, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told us there’s no evidence to show that and some reasons that it may not be the case — chiefly, the lack of testing, particularly early on. 
“[W]e weren’t seriously looking for cases in the US,” Nuzzo said.
Initially, the CDC testing criteria focused on those with symptoms who also had been to Wuhan or in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. By late February, those criteria included anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced doctors could order tests if they thought one was needed. 
Also, the U.S. restrictions were limited. In February, Nuzzo said, other countries, including Japan, Singapore and Korea, had a significant number of coronavirus cases, but they weren’t subject to travel restrictions. The U.S. “would likely not have picked it up” if travelers coming to the U.S. from those countries were infected with the virus “because we weren’t using these other countries as criteria for testing,” she said.
Omer, of the Yale Institute for Global Health, echoed that, saying, “People coming from Italy wouldn’t have been stopped,” whether they exhibited symptoms or not. (Trump’s restrictions on travel from Europe didn’t go into effect until March 13.)
The ability of the virus to elude limited travel restrictions raises questions about the one study we did find that estimates an impact on deaths. The study — which hasn’t been peer-reviewed — estimated Australia’s restrictions on travel from China will lower the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in the country over the next year. However, it didn’t consider any impact of cases coming in from other countries, saying it “illustrates the principle of travel bans and public health impact on epidemic control using China as a case study.”
The study, posted without peer review on medRxiv on March 12, estimated the travel restrictions, implemented Feb. 1, would reduce the cases and deaths by 87% over 400 days. The case and death counts are relatively low in Australia: 6,215 cases and 54 deaths as of April 10, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.
Past Studies Find Delay, Not Containment
Several past studies have looked at the impact of travel restrictions on epidemics. They also have found some delay in the spread of the diseases, if the restrictions are significant, but not containment.

A 2014 review of 23 studies on the impact of travel restrictions on the spread of influenza found overall they have “only limited effectiveness,” the degree of which varied depending on the restrictions themselves, epidemic size, transmissibility of the virus and other geographic considerations. The review, published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, said: “In isolation, travel restrictions might delay the spread and peak of pandemics by a few weeks or months but we found no evidence that they would contain influenza within a defined geographical area.”
A 2011 study (included in the above review) on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic published in the journal PLOS One found that travel restrictions creating a 40% reduction in air traffic to and from Mexico, the origin of the influenza strain, caused a three-day or less delay, on average, in the first imported cases reaching other countries. It said that “no containment was achieved by such restrictions.” Even assuming an unlikely 90% air traffic reduction, the study said, “the resulting delay would be on the order of 2 weeks.”
A 2012 study published in BMC Infectious Diseases by researchers in Hong Kong estimated that “imposing a 99% air travel restriction” would delay the peak of a new influenza pandemic in Hong Kong “by up to two weeks.” But, “[a]ntivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions,” the study said.

It’s possible that the U.S. travel restrictions on China could have had some impact in slowing the importation of cases to the U.S. But we don’t have evidence of that, or of what that impact is, let alone evidence that “hundreds of thousands” of lives were saved, as the president claimed.

At a press conference on Feb. 29, Fauci said, “If we had not done that, we would have had many, many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with.”
The studies we cited suggest that the travel restrictions could have slowed down, but not stopped, the importation of COVID-19 in the U.S."
165,Trump Didn’t Tweet Threat to Withhold Relief from Critics,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-didnt-tweet-threat-to-withhold-relief-from-critics/,,"Quick Take
Facebook and Instagram users are sharing a fake tweet attributed to President Donald Trump that suggests the president’s critics won’t get direct government payments to ease the financial burden of the coronavirus pandemic.


Full Story 
As the White House and Congress work on a massive stimulus package to address the novel coronavirus pandemic — which could result in payments to individual taxpayers — social media users are spreading a fabricated tweet attributed to President Donald Trump that suggests such aid could be withheld from his critics.
Trump never posted the tweet in question.
“Yes, I ordered the Treasury Secretary to send checks to Americans!” the fake post reads. “First however, we will go through your social media history from the last 4 years and search for any post with #NotMyPresident in it. I wouldn’t think of offending you with a check if I’m not your president! #MAGA.”
A quick search on Trump’s Twitter feed shows no trace of that tweet, which is dated March 17 at 4:13 p.m. We also couldn’t find it in the Trump Twitter Archive, which collects the president’s tweets — including those that have been deleted. The archive shows nearly 50 posts that day on Trump’s account, most of which were re-tweets.

The fictitious tweet may be intended as a joke meant to needle Trump’s critics, but if so, comments show that was not clear to everyone who encountered it.
One post of the doctored screenshot was shared on Instagram by the well-followed radio host Charlamagne Tha God and was liked by more than 61,000 users.
Among the comments on the post, one user said: “This man’s level of petty is absurd.” Another wrote: “Does this mean I can stop paying taxes cuz he’s not my president.”
The fake tweet was shared by many on Facebook, too.
It’s worth noting that the payments are part of a package to assist Americans and stabilize the U.S. economy that is still being worked out by the administration and legislators; it is not the president’s decision unilaterally. The $1 trillion proposal drafted by the White House calls for $500 billion for such payments.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on March 19 that payments could amount to $1,000 per adult and $500 per child — meaning a family of four could receive $3,000 — and could be issued in the coming weeks, if the necessary legislation passes.

166,Pace of U.S. Vaccinations vs. the World,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/pace-of-u-s-vaccinations-vs-the-world/,,"President Joe Biden boasts that the U.S. is on pace to be the first country in the world to vaccinate 100 million people. That’s true, but per capita the U.S. is not tops in the world in vaccinations.
Israel has administered about four times as many doses per 100 people as the U.S., and the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom have also administered significantly more doses per capita than the U.S., according to Our World in Data.
Speaking at an event on Feb. 25 commemorating the 50 millionth COVID-19 vaccine shot, Biden noted that the U.S. is ahead of schedule to deliver on his promise of administering 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office.
As we have written, the U.S. was already virtually at the pace Biden set as his goal — 1 million shots per day — before he took any action as president. It has risen since then. The seven-day average daily number of people vaccinated was 1.4 million on Feb. 24, 47% higher than on Jan. 20, when Biden was inaugurated, according to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID Data Tracker. According to preliminary numbers from the CDC, the U.S. had administered more than 78 million vaccine doses by March 1, with more than 57 million of them coming since Biden took office. 
“And the more people get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to beat this pandemic,” Biden said from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “That’s why one of my first goals in office when I — just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days as president. At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that. And then they said it was too small. But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country — perhaps the only one — to get that done.”
In remarks at a Federal Emergency Management Agency COVID-19 vaccination facility in Houston the following day, Biden again boasted that the U.S. was “ahead of schedule” to meet his 100 million shots in 100 days goal.
“And because of the people behind me and others, America … is going to be the first in the country — perhaps the first in the world — to get that done,” Biden said.
The implication, of course, is that the U.S. — the third most populous country — is leading the world in vaccine distribution. And in raw numbers, that’s accurate, according to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data.
But that’s not true per capita.
Looking at the total COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per capita for countries with a population of at least 1 million, Israel leads the world, with 94.9 doses per 100 people as of March 1. Second is the UAE at 60.9 doses per 100 people, and the United Kingdom is third at 31.1 doses per 100 people. By this measure, the U.S. ranks fourth at 23.2 doses per 100 people. This represents people who have gotten at least one dose of vaccine. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines — the only vaccines that had been administered at that time — require two doses to be most effective.

The United States’ seven-day average for daily vaccine doses administered per 100 people also ranked fourth on March 1.
Nor is the U.S. tops when looking at the percentage of a country’s population that has gotten at least one dose of a vaccine. According to a New York Times project, “Tracking Coronavirus Vaccinations Around the World,” Israel (54%), the United Kingdom (30.5%), Bahrain (19%) and Chile (19%) all have vaccinated a larger percentage of their population than the U.S. (15%).
Biden’s boast about the raw number of vaccinations in the U.S. leading the world reminds us of former President Donald Trump’s frequent claims that the U.S. led the world in testing for the coronavirus. But as is the case with Biden here, Trump was citing raw numbers for a relatively populous U.S. as opposed to the per-capita figure.

167,Flawed Analysis Leads to False Claim of ‘No Excess Deaths’ in 2020,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/flawed-analysis-leads-to-false-claim-of-no-excess-deaths-in-2020/,,"Quick Take
An economics professor’s flawed interpretation of U.S. mortality data has prompted a viral, false claim that COVID-19 hasn’t led to more deaths than normal this year. In fact, multiple analyses have found there to be a higher-than-normal number of deaths during the pandemic — as much as 20%, according to some studies.

Full Story
Viral headlines and social media posts are propelling the erroneous claim that there have been “no excess deaths” in the U.S. this year, suggesting that concern over COVID-19 is overblown.
That’s wrong.
As we’ve previously explained, excess deaths are deaths above the number expected in a given time period. The metric in the context of COVID-19 can help assess the impact of the pandemic, including by capturing direct and indirect effects of the virus. It can account for unreported COVID-19 deaths and for other factors — such as people dying from other causes, say avoiding medical attention, as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in October published a report that found that from late January through Oct. 3, there were an estimated 299,028 excess deaths. Two-thirds were estimated to be directly attributed to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 death toll has surpassed 275,000, as of Dec. 3, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Cases are rising around the country, and projections anticipate that the death count will climb past 300,000 by the end of the year.
The viral claim about “no excess deaths” — which has been amplified by unreliable websites and disseminated on Facebook and Twitter — stems from an online presentation by an economics lecturer at Johns Hopkins. But it’s flawed for multiple reasons, experts say.
In a Nov. 13 webinar, Genevieve Briand, the assistant director for the university’s Applied Economics master’s program, looked at select CDC data, such as weekly reported deaths, to reach the faulty conclusion that there is “no evidence that COVID-19 create[d] any excess deaths.”
“Total death number are not above normal death numbers,” she claims. “We found no evidence to the contrary.”
Her claims were then relayed in a story in the Johns Hopkins News-Letter, a student-run publication, which said the analysis showed COVID-19 “has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.” The publication later retracted the report. An archived version of the story, however, has been shared on Facebook 10,000 times according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
The student publication’s retraction also became part of the false narrative online, triggering claims that the university had published a “study” then retracted it. “Johns Hopkins Study Mysteriously Disappears after it Revealed, In Spite of COVID, No More Deaths in 2020 Than In Prior Years,” read the false headline on the Gateway Pundit, a far-right website known for spreading misinformation.
Briand, however, confirmed in an email to us that she had not published her analysis anywhere apart from the webinar. The video is still available on YouTube, where it’s been viewed more than 58,000 times. Briand told us she stood by her analysis.
But Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Population Health at the Virginia Commonwealth University, told us that “multiple studies have shown that total deaths in the US are about 20% higher than expected.”
Woolf and colleagues relayed as much in an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October. “Although total US death counts are remarkably consistent from year to year, US deaths increased by 20% during March-July 2020,” the authors wrote.
Studies from others, including a paper by two University of Oxford economists, have reached similar conclusions.
Woolf said in an email that the lecture video instead presented a “very unsophisticated analysis, in which the speaker uses crude death counts for one year (2018) as the basis for comparison and performs simple subtraction from 2020 values for her assertions. Any reputable analysis of excess deaths is based on statistical modeling that computes seasonal averages over a period of many years, and this is done to adjust for random variation from year to year.”
“For example, our studies use Poisson regression modeling. Statistical modeling is necessary to know whether differences in death counts are statistically significant,” he said. “The speaker admits to merely eyeballing the trend lines for 2020. Researchers prefer to use statistical modeling to know whether a supposed change in counts is random variation or a statistically significant trend.”
The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics excess death analysis (which uses such modeling) has found deaths above normal rates week after week since the end of March — as readers can see in the center’s chart below.
<a href='https:&#47;&#47;www.cdc.gov&#47;'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CO&#47;COVID_excess_mort_withcauses_11252020&#47;WeeklyExcessDeaths&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>                   
 
Briand’s video doesn’t consider that analysis or any other previous studies on the issue.
Instead, she looks at some public CDC data and, in part, homes in on a spike in deaths in spring 2020, observing that it does not correspond with an increase in all deaths — such as heart disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, influenza and pneumonia — as was the case during a spike in deaths in early January 2018.
“Our death number increased in 2020 and we have less heart attack than in 2018,” she said. “Where have all the heart attacks gone?”
But she’s misleadingly comparing different points in time for the two years.
Bob Anderson, chief of NCHS’ Mortality Statistics Branch, said in an email statement that the video’s claims are born out of “a fundamental lack of understanding of the seasonal nature of mortality.”
While deaths typically increase in the winter, peaking around the New Year, “[d]eaths then decline in the spring through the summer and then increase again in the fall through the winter,” Anderson said. “But, what we are seeing in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic is very different. In the spring of 2020, during a period where we normally should be seeing declining mortality, deaths continued to increase and were at unusually high levels through the spring.”
The comparison of the two time periods used in the video is “not appropriate,” he said.
Anderson added that in 2018, “deaths followed the normal pattern (although at a higher level than normal). In 2020, deaths did not follow the normal pattern … they should have been declining in the spring, but instead increased substantially. In addition, we have an additional peak in deaths in late July/early August that seems to have been completely ignored in this analysis.”
“With regard to heart disease, it is true that heart disease deaths did not increase in April 2020 to the same extent that they did in January 2018,” he said. “But, in January, heart disease deaths are normally at a peak. In April, heart disease deaths are normally on the decline. Even so, the number of heart disease deaths has been largely above normal throughout the pandemic. The same is true for other causes of death, especially diabetes, hypertension, and dementia.”
So far this year, through the week ending Nov. 21, there have been 598,659 reported heart disease deaths in the U.S. — according to incomplete, provisional death count data published by the CDC on Dec. 3. In all of 2018, there were 655,381 deaths from heart disease. 
In response to an inquiry about Briand’s claims, Johns Hopkins University spokeswoman Karen Lancaster said in a statement that “[w]hen individuals associated with Johns Hopkins exercise the right of expression, they do not speak on behalf of the institution.”
“As set forth in the Johns Hopkins University Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom, academic freedom ‘is designed to afford members of the community the broadest possible scope for unencumbered expression, investigation, analysis, and discourse,’ all of which must be subject to the scrutiny of peer review,” she said.
Lancaster added: “Johns Hopkins University continues to have grave concerns regarding the extraordinary toll of death and illness wrought by COVID-19 and remains committed to contributing our expertise in responding to this continuously escalating global health crisis.”

She was a guest on WHYY’s “Radio Times” on April 15 for a discussion on fact-checking and the challenge  for the media in covering these briefings live, along with Mark Lukasiewicz, a former senior executive at NBC News and ABC News.
Robertson discussed several recent FactCheck.org articles debunking claims President Donald Trump had made in these briefings. For instance, constitutional experts say Trump was wrong that he, not governors, had the power to “open up the states” where businesses were closed or residents were ordered to stay at home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
The president also made false statements about the drug hydroxychloroquine. Trump claimed “studies” had suggested there are few novel coronavirus cases in “malaria countries” because of the use of hydroxychloroquine as an antimalarial drug. But FactCheck.org found no such studies exist, and the drug is not widely used for malaria in much of the world. Similarly, he falsely claimed “people with lupus,” who also take hydroxychloroquine to treat symptoms of their disease, “aren’t catching this horrible virus.” In fact, people with lupus have reported contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Robertson also discussed why FactCheck.org doesn’t use the word “lie” to label political falsehoods. A “lie” describes an intention to deceive, and we can’t prove someone’s intent. We don’t know whether a politician was mistaken or believed he or she was correct, for instance.

169,"Dueling Trump, Biden Claims on COVID-19 Vaccination Distribution",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/dueling-trump-biden-claims-on-covid-19-vaccination-distribution/,,"As scientists work to find a safe vaccine for COVID-19, President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have made competing claims about the administration’s plans to carry out the daunting task of distributing hundreds of millions of vaccine doses:

Biden goes too far when he claims the Trump administration hasn’t done “any planning” for vaccine distribution and has no “command officer” in charge of it. Trump put the Army’s top logistics officer in charge, and numerous federal officials are working on vaccination prioritization and distribution plans.
Trump, for his part, exaggerates when he says the Department of Defense is “all mobilized” and “fully set up” to distribute the vaccine. Planning is still underway. And, while the military is involved in distribution preparations and planning, we were told by the Department of Health and Human Services that “DOD support may not be required at all” for vaccination distribution.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, has infected at least 4.8 million people and killed more than 160,000 in the United States, according to the COVID-19 dashboard from Johns Hopkins University.
While the race for a vaccine is on, the Trump administration must figure out how to distribute more than 300 million doses — possibly more than 600 million doses, if the vaccine requires two doses — to reach everyone in the country.
Contrary to Biden’s claims, the administration has begun planning for the distribution of a vaccine and has a “command officer” in place.
The Department of Health and Human Services announced on May 15 that Army Gen. Gustave Perna would be the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed — a joint project of HHS and the Department of Defense that aims “to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution” of a COVID-19 vaccine. The goal is to have 300 million vaccination doses available by January.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is part of HHS, will recommend priorities for vaccination distribution. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in April formed a COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group to recommend priorities on how to distribute the vaccine. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine also have formed a committee to help the CDC “in planning for equitable allocation of vaccines against COVID-19.”
HHS will use “traditional vaccine distribution networks” to deliver the vaccines, a senior HHS official told us on the condition that we not use the official’s name. The Defense Department will handle the logistics of distribution and manufacturing, including assembling the vaccination kits, according to a senior administration official who spoke anonymously at a July 30 background briefing.
But there’s no evidence that the military is “fully set up” to distribute a vaccine or that it will play a major role in the actual distribution of the vaccines, contrary to Trump’s remarks on July 28.
The amount of work that still remains to do was evident at the July 30 background briefing, where two senior administration officials described some of the biggest logistical challenges to delivering vaccines, such as planning “for a multitude of scenarios,” depending on the type of vaccine and the number of doses available; setting priorities when limited doses are available; and creating an IT system “to keep track of every individual in the country who’s getting” a vaccine. All of that work is in progress.
“At this time, the administration is working through the exact algorithms for the distribution and allocation of potential COVID-19 vaccines as it will not fully understand the performance of the vaccines until phase III trials are complete,” the HHS senior official told us in an email on Aug. 4.
Dr. Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccines advisory committee, said he believes there is a plan, but he doesn’t know what it is — even after attending two briefings with Defense Department officials involved in the planning. 
“I don’t know if there is or isn’t [a plan]. I’m choosing to believe there is a plan – I can’t image they don’t have a plan,” Offit said in a phone interview.
“I don’t think it is fair for Joe Biden to say there is no plan,” Offit said. “It is fair to say we don’t know what the plan is, and we may never know,” because of the “secretive culture of the Defense Department.”
Biden vs. Trump on Vaccination Distribution
In an interview on MSNBC’s “The ReidOut,” Biden criticized Trump’s leadership on preparations for vaccination delivery. 
Biden, July 20: In addition, I would suggest right now — and I have urged the president to do this — right now, there may be a vaccine, God willing, after the 1st of the year. We should have a command officer now. We should be spending $25 billion to put together exactly how that will be distributed to over 300 million Americans. How will we do that? Where will it go? How will we get it done well? It needs planning – planning. And without any planning between now and Election Day, now and the time we are sworn in, it’s going to make it incredibly more difficult to get anything done.
Nine days later, Biden unveiled his plan for racial equality at a speech in Wilmington, and once again he challenged Trump “to put someone in charge” of vaccination preparedness.
Biden, July 28: But I want to say it again, I’m going to keep saying it. The president, as we speak, should be starting and should have started three months ago to put someone in charge of how specifically, like waging a war. How are you going to distribute the vaccine when it arrives, when it arrives, when it’s there?
On the same day, Trump described a U.S. military that is “fully set up” to carry out its mission to deliver vaccination doses across the country.
Trump, July 28: We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 500 million doses. And, logistically, we’re using our military, our great military — a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations — and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They’re all mobilized. It’s been fully set up.
When we asked what the former vice president meant by his remarks, the Biden campaign provided us with a long list of examples that it said showed “Trump’s handling of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine has been marked by empty promises and a distrust of science & medicine.” The list mostly consisted of news articles, from February through July, of Trump’s “empty promises” to have a vaccine “very soon.”
The campaign also provided a “comprehensive vaccine plan,” co-authored by Ezekiel J. Emanuel for the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Emanuel is a member of Biden’s coronavirus task force who was the special adviser for health policy to the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from January 2009 to January 2011.
“It’s self-evident what the vice president means,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin told us in an interview. “The scope and scale of the challenge before us to develop a safe and effective vaccine, to manufacture it and all of its parts, and deliver it safely and effectively in the midst of an active pandemic is an unprecedented challenge. This administration has shown itself incapable of planning or managing any of the aspects of this crisis, despite the people they have ostensibly put in charge.”
The Biden campaign’s supporting materials and subsequent interviews with campaign officials cast doubt on the Trump administration’s ability to carry out the formidable task of distributing more than 300 million vaccine doses. But they do not support Biden’s claims that there hasn’t been “any planning” and there is no “command officer” in charge of the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine.
We also asked HHS to provide us with information on the administration’s plans to distribute vaccinations. The department sent us transcripts of Operation Warp Speed background briefings, an OWS fact sheet and list of contracts the administration has for the advance manufacturing of vaccine candidates.
Likewise, the HHS materials don’t support Trump’s claim of the military being “fully set up” to distribute vaccines, but rather show an administration that still has a lot of planning to do. And the military will have just a “complementary role to the traditional vaccine distribution networks,” as the HHS official told us.
Here we take a look at what we know so far about the administration’s plans for delivering a vaccine once it is available.
Operation Warp Speed
The goal of Operation Warp Speed is to begin manufacturing a vaccine even before it is authorized or approved for use, as explained in an HHS fact sheet. That would allow for wide distribution of the vaccine more quickly once it is proven to be safe and effective and receives all necessary government approvals. (The FDA must authorize or approve the vaccine and manufacturing process.)
“Rather than eliminating steps from traditional development timelines, steps will proceed simultaneously, such as starting manufacturing of the vaccine at industrial scale well before the demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety as happens normally,” the fact sheet says. “This increases the financial risk, but not the product risk.”
There are many people and agencies involved, including Perna, the Army general who was confirmed by the Senate earlier early July to be the chief operating officer of OWS. Moncef Slaoui, a former chairman of global vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline, is the project’s chief adviser.
Perna had been the commanding general of the Army Materiel Command, which is responsible for logistics, prior to his appointment.
In addition to the military, several federal agencies at the HHS are involved in the development and manufacturing of a vaccine, including the CDC, FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
Offit said he supports the concept of Operation Warp Speed. “I give credit to the administration for doing this,” he said. “Vaccine is ultimately our way out of this.”
The administration has contracts with several pharmaceutical companies to mass produce their vaccine candidates at the government’s expense. On July 31, the administration announced a $2 billion agreement with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline that will, among other things, provide for the production of 100 million vaccine doses, with an option to purchase an additional 500 million. Similar contracts were announced Johnson & Johnson for 100 million doses of its vaccine candidate and AstraZeneca for 300 million doses.
“If it doesn’t work, we throw it away,” Offit said of the vaccines that fail to win government approval. “That’s fine. I think that’s all good.”
Offit, however, expressed concern that Trump might short-circuit the licensing process and pressure the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for one or more vaccines prior to the Nov. 3 election.
Under the EUA process, “the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products … to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases,” as the FDA explains.
As an example of his concern, Offit cited the FDA’s decision in March to issue an EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, even though there was very little evidence that the drugs were safe and effective for COVID-19. Trump repeatedly advocated the use of the drugs for COVID-19, but less than three months later the FDA revoked its EUA because the drugs were found to pose a health risk and were “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19.”
In a June 8 opinion piece, Emanuel and Offit says researchers estimate that it should take “at least another eight to 12 months to determine whether these coronavirus vaccines are effective.” They fear the FDA will issue an EUA for an unlicensed vaccine before the clinical trials are completed.
The administration has sent mixed signals on when a vaccine could be available.
Trump repeatedly has said a vaccine would be available “by the end of the year,” even suggesting recently that it may be ready well before the end of the year. “We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year,” he said at an Aug. 3 press briefing.
Three days later, Trump in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera said that it is “possible before” the election, “but right around that time.”
NIH Director Dr. Frances Collins, who has called having a vaccine by the end of the year a “stretch goal,” told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer there’s not enough information yet to say when a vaccine may prove to be safe and effective.
“I don’t have a crystal ball. I think it would be amazing if, by the end of this year, we were able to say we have at least one of these that’s safe and effective,” he said. “And I’m cautiously optimistic about that. But trying to put a finer prediction on the timetable right now, I don’t think any of us have enough information yet to know how that’s going to shake out.”
The National Institutes of Health announced on July 27 that a phase three clinical trial has begun for the first vaccine candidate, which was developed by the biotech company Moderna Inc. and the NIH. About 30,000 volunteers who do not have COVID-19 are expected to participate in the trial, which will determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. A successful phase three trial is the final step needed for approval.
On the same day, Pfizer and BioNTech announced it would start a phase two/three combined trial that also will involve up to 30,000 volunteers.
There are five or six other vaccine candidates “that the federal government is actively involved with is going into phase three trials over the next few months,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at an July 31 congressional hearing.
Even though Collins said it would be “amazing” to have a vaccine by the end of the year, a senior administration official held out the possibility of a vaccine being available by mid-October.
“This could be, you know, it’s theoretically possible we could have 10 million doses in the middle of October or the end of October. It may not be till the end of December, it may be in early January,” the official said at the July 30 briefing. “So the fine line we’re walking is getting the American people very excited about the potential of vaccines and then missing on expectations versus, you know, having a bunch of vaccines in the warehouse and not as many folks want to get it.”
Setting ‘Priorities’ for COVID-19 Vaccination
Once a vaccine candidate receives emergency use authorization or licensure from the FDA, the challenge will be to distribute the vaccines in a fair and equitable way.
Who will be among the first to be vaccinated?
The ACIP’s vaccine work group — which has 41 members and is chaired by Beth Bell, a clinical professor of global health at the University of Washington — has been working to answer that question since April.
Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi, of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, gave a presentation on COVID-19 vaccine prioritization at the work group’s June 24 meeting.
“Although the goal is to offer vaccine to the entire U.S. population, identifying priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination is essential to support vaccine implementation planning,” Mbaeyi said at the meeting. “This planning needs to begin prior to vaccine approval so that vaccine can be distributed without delay once available.”
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine announced on July 21 that they have formed a committee to assist the CDC and National Institutes of Health in developing an equitable distribution plan. It held its first meeting July 24.
Mbaeyi said the work group will use a tiered approach to vaccine prioritization based in part on a planning document for flu vaccines. She called the document, which was updated in 2018, a “useful framework for adaptation for COVID-19 vaccine prioritization.”
These proposed objectives will guide the work group in establishing priority groups for vaccinations:

Ensure safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
Reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality in the population.
Help minimize disruption to society and economy, including maintaining health care capacity.
Ensure equity in vaccine allocation and distribution.

At the July 30 briefing, a senior administration official said one of the biggest challenges to developing priorities and distribution plans is the uncertainty of knowing what vaccines will be approved for use.
Senior administration official, July 30: [W]hat I mean by uncertainty is we have to plan for a multitude of scenarios. Will the vaccine be effective in certain parts of the population and not effective in other parts of the population? What volume will we have at what period in time? Will we have simultaneous vaccines that we have to deal with? So, there is – will it be one dose or two doses? Some vaccines are one dose, some vaccines are two doses. The cold storage conditions under which we have to transport and store them are different by vaccine.
So when you do the number of combinations of all of those variables, you have a lot of complexity. We believe we are planning for all of them and there’s a number of components associated with planning for all of them.
The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, so the elderly will be a priority — if the FDA-approved vaccine works for them, a senior administration official said in the briefing.
The ACIP will make prioritization recommendations to the CDC director and HHS secretary “in a transparent evidence-based process,” Mbaeyi said at the June 24 meeting.
In a July 27 interview on CNN, Fauci said that’s the “standard way” for setting priorities for vaccination distribution that has been enhanced by the input of other health officials and agencies.
Distributing the COVID-19 Vaccines
Beyond planning to deliver the vaccine to priority groups, the administration needs a plan for making doses available for everyone.
On MSNBC’s “The ReidOut,” Biden questioned “exactly how” the vaccine “will be distributed to over 300 million Americans,” adding that “without any planning between now and Election Day, now and the time we are sworn in, it’s going to make it incredibly more difficult to get anything done.”
It’s not true that there isn’t “any planning” for the mass distribution of vaccines; but no plan has been made public, and there have been mixed signals on how the administration will distribute vaccines.
Trump claimed that the military is “fully set up” to deliver the vaccines, and a senior administration official at the July 30 briefing seemed to confirm that the Defense Department is handling “all the logistics.”
“The DOD is handling all the logistics of getting the vaccines to the right place at the right time and the right condition,” the official said. “And it’s not just the logistics of distribution it is the logistics of manufacturing and the logistics of preparing for manufacturing as well. And it involves things like kitting,” referring to the assembling of the vaccination kits.
“So, you know, we’re in receipt and we’ll continue to be in receipt of hundreds of millions of needles, and syringes and vials. And all of those need to be prepared properly by type of vaccine,” the officials said. “The DOD is handling all of those logistics.”
An administration official said distribution will be different for COVID-19 vaccines.
“[T]his is going to be unlike the influenza vaccine where it’s largely a poll system — meaning, oh you know, a CVS or a Walmart says, ‘Send us 1,000 doses of this,’ and then we wait for the next order to come in,” an administration official said at the July 30 briefing. “We are going to be pushing the vaccines out hopefully to nursing homes, to seniors who are not ambulatory and stuck in their homes, to frontline healthcare workers, to meat packing plants, name it.”
The administration officials at the briefing offered assurances it will work, but no plans.
“I would say for anyone who’s served in the military or known someone that does, I really think we excel at operational planning and I think the key way to address uncertainty is plan every detail with every contingency,” said a senior official, whose name is withheld at the administration’s request. “And I think — I hope that, frankly, the American public can be reassured that, you know, I don’t see how we could work details more than we have been to address all of those different contingencies based on vaccine, as well as we learn, you know, which vaccine works best for which type of person.”
But when we asked HHS about distribution, a senior department official told us it would be using the “traditional vaccine distribution networks,” and the military may or may not have a “complementary role.” A 2019 report by Deloitte — “The role of distributors in the US health care industry” — said drug distribution “is highly concentrated among three traditional full-line distributors: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson.” Since discussions are ongoing, HHS could not provide any information related to any pending contracts, the official said.
HHS official, Aug. 4: HHS will likely work with the traditional pharmaceutical distribution networks to accomplish this nationwide effort. The timing of those contracted efforts will be driven by drug manufacturing timelines to ensure vaccines are available to be distributed as soon as the FDA approves an EUA or drug licensure.
DOD may be called on to provide a complementary role to the traditional vaccine distribution networks where speed of response or distribution to remote sites requires DOD augmentation. DOD support may not be required at all and may be the exception, not the norm.
HHS gave a similar response to McClatchy in a July 29 story sent to us by the Biden campaign.
Biden’s point, the campaign said, is, “You can’t take the administration at face value.”
“Trump said they are ‘all mobilized,’ quote ‘fully set up,’ [for distribution],” Gwin, a Biden spokesman, told us. “But you and I can’t fact check that. There is no plan.”
This concerns Offit, too.
“There wasn’t a clear plan for PPE, testing and contact tracing,” Offit said, referring to shortages of personal protective equipment to hospital workers, delays in making COVID-19 tests available to the public and the failure of contact tracing in the U.S. “And this is much harder than that.”
Offit said he believes there will be two or three vaccines and some may require two doses, meaning that the distribution system requires tracking people to make sure they get a second dose. That would be done by the CDC, a senior administration official said in the July 30 briefing.
“Things like postvaccination, tracking of patients will be handled as you could expect by the CDC,” the official said. “Some of the communications through the state and the state relationships [with] the state public health organizations will be handled through the CDC.”
One administration official said there is “a huge IT component” to the administration’s plans to distribute the vaccines and track those who receive doses.
“We will be leveraging a lot of private partners who already have a good deal of that in place,” the official said. “We are under negotiation with several of them, but suffice it to say, we are not developing all that from scratch.”
When we asked HHS for details on its information technology plans, we were told “the administration is working to conclude a number of contracts,” which will be made public “as soon as it is possible.”
Offit said if one vaccine turns out to be more effective than another vaccine for certain population groups, such as the elderly, there will be “different recommendations for different groups.” That will also complicate the CDC’s vaccination plans. Most vaccines are dispensed at such locations as hospitals, doctor’s offices, pharmacies, schools and at work, but the pandemic has largely shut down schools, and millions of Americans are working remotely or not working at all. 
“That is the challenge here,” Offit said. “What is going to be the point of care? How do you ID that people walking up to you are in a priority group, and how do you make sure there is a second dose?”
Offit added, “I think even if they are incredibly detailed about how they are going to do this – it is still incredibly hard to do this.”

The campaign also provided a “comprehensive vaccine plan,” co-authored by Ezekiel J. Emanuel for the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Three days later, Trump in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera said that it is “possible before” the election, “but right around that time.”

170,Mayim Bialik and Sons Got COVID-19 Vaccine,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-mayim-bialik-and-sons-got-covid-19-vaccine/,,"
Mayim Bialik, who once starred on the television show “The Big Bang Theory,” has made headlines in the past for controversial statements on vaccines. But in a video posted to her personal YouTube channel in October, the actress — who also holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA  — said that she and her two teenage sons would be vaccinated against COVID-19. Bialik said in an interview in April with Cheddar News that she had received the vaccine. 
Bialik’s publicist, Heather Besignano, confirmed to FactCheck.org via email on July 16 that “Mayim and her children are all fully vaccinated for the COVID-19 virus.”
Despite all this, a meme circulating online falsely suggests that Bialik has declined all vaccines, including the one for COVID-19. The image features a photo of Bialik framed by the words, “Holds PhD in Neuroscience. Refuses to Vaccinate #SmartParentsDon’tVax.” 
The meme was posted to the Facebook page Staying Alive is Not Enough, which has over 1 million followers. Comments on the post seemed to applaud the meme’s sentiment, with some users writing “Good for her!” and “I new I would like her,” while another urged the government to “take their shot and shove it.”
Bialik, a self-described skeptic of “Big Pharm,” has received criticism for past comments in which she expressed hesitancy to vaccinate her children. In her October YouTube video, she revealed that her two sons, then 12 and 15, had never received a flu vaccine and that she had not received a vaccine in 30 years. 
In a 2009 interview with People magazine, Bialik described her family as “non-vaccinating,” but said she made “no claims about people’s individual decisions.” Still, Bialik pushed back against the perception that she is “against vaccines” on Twitter in 2015, writing that her “kids are vaccinated.” 
Recently, Bialik has come out in support of the COVID-19 vaccination effort, including for her children. On her YouTube channel, where she posts regularly about mental health and parenting, the actress confirmed that she had chosen to “enthusiastically vaccinate,” along with her sons, for both COVID-19 and the flu this year.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 12 to 15 years of age on May 10. (The U.S. had previously authorized use of the vaccine for people 16 and older in December 2020.)
In a January interview with Yahoo Life, Bialik said her decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was “based on kind of the basic science of what’s going on in the world and how we protect ourselves.” 
“It’s not that I’m, like, ‘pro every single vaccine that anyone talks about all the time everywhere, every single minute.’ I have a lot of questions about the vaccine industry, as do a lot of people,” Bialik said. “[But] when it comes to this virus, the insidiousness of this virus, the way this virus works, the way that it adapts, we absolutely need to see this as distinctly different from the flu. … This is something we need absolute protection from.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends vaccines for children against numerous viruses and diseases, including measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus and hepatitis A and B. As with the COVID-19 vaccines, childhood vaccines are safe and effective and have greatly reduced the number of cases and deaths from several childhood diseases.
For example, the CDC says that “an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States” before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, resulting in roughly 400 to 500 deaths each year. Last year, there were only 13 confirmed cases of the measles in the U.S., according to the CDC.
After starring in the 1990s sitcom “Blossom,” Bialik completed her bachelor’s degree in neuroscience in 2000 and her doctorate in neuroscience in 2007, both at University of California, Los Angeles. Her Ph.D. thesis was titled, “Hypothalamic Regulation in Relation to Maladaptive, Obsessive-compulsive, Affiliative, and Satiety Behaviors in Prader-Willi Syndrome.”",Cecelia Vieira,2021-07-20 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"In a 2009 interview with People magazine, Bialik described her family as “non-vaccinating,” but said she made “no claims about people’s individual decisions.” Still, Bialik pushed back against the perception that she is “against vaccines” on Twitter in 2015, writing that her “kids are vaccinated.”

171,"Benefits Outweigh Risks of Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine, Contrary to Posts Misusing VAERS Data",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-benefits-outweigh-risks-of-pediatric-covid19-vaccine-contrary-to-posts-misusing-vaers-data/,,"
As we’ve written several times before, social media posts and online claims have repeatedly misused and misrepresented the unverified data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System to make false and misleading claims about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration use VAERS as an alert system to detect potential safety problems with vaccines. All reports are accepted into the database without determining whether the event was caused by a particular vaccine. When experts see an unusual pattern of reports that could be a safety signal, they can then investigate; all reports of serious adverse events are reviewed. And, the CDC says, if someone dies after a vaccination, health care providers are required to report the death by the FDA, even if it’s not clear the vaccine played a role.
A disclaimer on the VAERS website warns: “The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.” The website continues: “One of the main limitations of VAERS data is that it cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event. This limitation has caused confusion in the publicly available data from VAERS WONDER, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. There have been instances where people have misinterpreted reports of deaths following vaccination as deaths caused by the vaccines; that is not accurate.”
One of the latest online claims to misinterpret VAERS reports of deaths focuses on the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, which was authorized by the FDA in late October. The claim, which originated in an Oct. 31 post by Toby Rogers, who writes for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, Children’s Health Defense, is that more kids will die from the vaccine than will be saved from the vaccine.
“So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus,” Rogers claimed.
Other websites are now spreading the claim, falsely saying that “CDC and Big Pharma Data Confirm” this.
Data from the CDC and Pfizer do not confirm this. Instead, the figures rely on distorting VAERS reports and using a problematic concept known as the number needed to vaccinate, or NNV, which is sometimes used to assess the benefit of immunization.
Pfizer’s clinical trial, which included 4,600 children, found the pediatric vaccine to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic disease and did not identify any serious safety concerns.
VAERS
The claim that the Pfizer vaccine “would kill 5,248 children,” comes from wrongly assuming all reports of deaths to VAERS for those ages 12 to 24 are accurate and attributable to the COVID-19 vaccines, and then amplifying it by a factor of 41, a disputed figure that comes from two researchers who claim it is the “underreporting rate” of events submitted to VAERS. Reuters has fact-checked a similar claim about deaths from the vaccines based on that underreporting rate.
An FDA spokesperson told Reuters that said the agency “strongly disagrees” with that analysis, saying there is no evidence to suggest that the number of reported deaths are underestimated to “such a large degree.”
The VAERS website acknowledges that underreporting is a limitation to this system. However, the “degree of underreporting varies widely.” Minor side effects, such as soreness at the site of injection, are often not reported. “On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes,” the VAERS website says.
Rogers said he used reports of 128 fatalities in VAERS for those ages 12 to 24, because there wouldn’t be data for kids ages 5 to 11 since the vaccine had just been authorized for that age group.
When we searched the VAERS database on Nov. 23, we found 30 reports of deaths for the age group 6 to 17 and another 124 reports for the age group 18 to 29. But as we said, the VAERS reports are unverified, and everyone is encouraged to report any post-vaccination event, even if it’s unclear whether there’s a connection to the vaccine. As an example of this, two of the deaths among the 6-to-17 age group were suicides.
“Just because somebody reports death doesn’t mean that the vaccine caused the death. So we don’t use VAERS to determine death rates or anything concerning death,” a CDC spokesperson told us previously.
When a death is reported, the CDC investigates, using medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates. For example, the CDC says, “A review of reports indicates a causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event—that causes blood clots with low platelets—which has caused or directly contributed to six confirmed deaths.” As of Nov. 17, more than 16.2 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, has primarily affected females between the age of 18 and 49, and has not been identified with either mRNA vaccine.
As of Nov. 24, more than 196 million Americans have been fully vaccinated.
Other fact-checkers have written about similar claims that misuse VAERS data to claim the vaccine will kill more children than COVID-19. CDC spokesperson Martha Sharan told Reuters for a Nov. 16 story: “To date, there are no confirmed cases linking reports of death in children after COVID-19 vaccination to the COVID-19 vaccine.”
While no kids in the trial developed myocarditis or pericarditis, the CDC and FDA will be monitoring for this condition, as we’ve explained. They have occurred on rare occasions following vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech’s adult vaccine, particularly in young adults and male adolescents, the CDC says.
The risk is likely to be lower for younger children, since classic myocarditis is less common in younger children and vaccine-related myocarditis appears to be less common in 12- to 15-year-olds than in 16- to 29-year-olds. Additionally, the pediatric Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contains a third of the mRNA in the adult and teen formulation. Whether, or how frequently, vaccine-related myocarditis occurs in children will remain unknown until more children are vaccinated.
Number Needed to Vaccinate
As part of his faulty calculations, Rogers also makes incorrect claims about a metric known as the number needed to vaccinate, or the number of vaccinations that need to be given to avoid a single outcome, as a COVID-19 case, hospitalization or death. 
In his posts, he falsely claims that the CDC is required to use NNV, according to an agency document.
“Your move CDC — your own Guidance document states that you must provide this number,” he wrote.
But the cited document doesn’t stipulate that NNV must be used, only that it may be used. And in fact, the document points out some drawbacks to using the figure.
“NNV to prevent a case of a particular infection-related sequela can be intuitive to medically-trained decision-makers, but may not capture all outcomes related to decision making and may not capture all aspects of a disease system,” it reads, “such as adverse events or in some cases benefits that occur due to indirect, or herd immunity, effects.”
A CDC spokesperson told us that according to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices charter, recommendations for vaccines used in the United States include numerous factors, including disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of the evidence, economic analyses and implementation issues. 
“The number needed to vaccinate (or NNV) is a method to help assess and present the ‘benefit’ in a benefit-risk analysis, but per the ACIP guidance on economic analyses, is just one of several outcomes that can be assessed depending on the specific policy question under consideration,” she said in an email. “CDC has frequently used a more comprehensive approach in analyzing and presenting the benefit-risk balance of the FDA-authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines, one that is not limited to just NNV.”
The CDC did present a brief NNV analysis as part of its larger discussion of the risks and benefits of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 during its Nov. 2 advisory committee meeting, as Rogers acknowledged in an update to his article. 
In that analysis, depending on the level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, 9 to 26 children would need to be vaccinated to avoid one COVID-19 case; 2,213 to 8,187 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent a COVID-19 hospitalization; and 3,777 to 11,226 kids would need to be vaccinated to prevent a case of MIS-C, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. 
Rogers contends that those estimates are “untethered from reality,” but cites an estimate for NNV in adults that is a republished version of an article that was retracted.
As we wrote before, when explaining why the original article was flawed, relying solely on NNV can be problematic because it is highly dependent on certain factors, including the time frame used. 
Short time frames, Jeffrey Morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us, can greatly underestimate the benefits; other pandemic prevention measures, such as physical distancing, can also affect the number. And the success of a vaccine will make the metric appear worse. Morris called it “an extremely flawed measure.”
Another NNV estimate Rogers cites stems from a correspondence submitted to BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, from a retired pediatrician in Cooperstown, New York. 
The journal appended an editorial notice for readers clarifying that it was an online comment from a third party, and not an article in the journal, adding that it is “attributed in a misleading way on certain websites and social media.”
Even if the NNV numbers for hospitalization or death appear high for children, there is no agreed upon threshold for interpreting what is too high, as a review article about the metric explains. The review also notes that it’s difficult to generalize from NNVs, since they are so specific to certain circumstances, and says that most NNVs “do not account for indirect or dynamic effects of vaccines, which are often significant.”
Both the CDC and FDA, along with their outside corresponding advisory committees, have evaluated the risks and benefits of the Pfizer/BioNTech pediatric COVID-19 vaccine, as they are understood now, and have determined the benefits outweigh the risks.
In its benefit-risk assessment, the FDA assumed the myocarditis rate in vaccinated kids 5 through 11 years old would be the same as in those 12 through 15 years old, which is likely to overestimate the risk. In various scenarios, it found the vaccine prevents more bad outcomes from COVID-19 than it causes, except for a scenario in which transmission falls to its June low point — just before delta become the dominant variant in the U.S. In that case, the FDA model showed more hospitalizations due to vaccine-related myocarditis than hospitalizations prevented from COVID-19. However, the FDA said the benefits still might outweigh the risks in that scenario because vaccine-related myocarditis is usually less serious than typical myocarditis.
Neither agency has concluded the pediatric COVID-19 vaccine will kill more children than it will save. On the contrary, their analyses suggest the vaccine will benefit children, and notably, many of the experts involved in making the shots available, along with others, have said they are eager to vaccinate their own children and grandchildren.",Lori Robertson,2021-11-24 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“NNV to prevent a case of a particular infection-related sequela can be intuitive to medically-trained decision-makers, but may not capture all outcomes related to decision making and may not capture all aspects of a disease system,” it reads, “such as adverse events or in some cases benefits that occur due to indirect, or herd immunity, effects.”
A CDC spokesperson told us that according to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices charter, recommendations for vaccines used in the United States include numerous factors, including disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of the evidence, economic analyses and implementation issues. For example, the CDC says, “A review of reports indicates a causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and TTS, a rare and serious adverse event—that causes blood clots with low platelets—which has caused or directly contributed to six confirmed deaths.” As of Nov. 17, more than 16.2 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.

172,"Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-hypes-potential-covid-19-drugs-but-evidence-so-far-is-slim/,,"President Donald Trump has enthusiastically pushed the use of two malaria drugs — one in combination with an antibiotic — to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. But there is currently only limited evidence to suggest the drugs are effective against the new virus.
Over a series of press conferences and on Twitter, Trump has repeatedly expressed his optimism that two existing malaria drugs — chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine — will work in COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Calling himself a “big fan” of hydroxychloroquine, Trump said in a March 20 press conference that he had “seen things that are impressive,” even as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that the evidence supporting the drug was anecdotal — and that it would take a large, well-done clinical trial to prove its effectiveness.
As we have written previously, Trump left the misleading impression that the FDA had approved chloroquine to treat COVID-19. In fact, there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID-19, although existing drugs can be legally prescribed by doctors to treat other ailments for which they weren’t approved in what’s called off-label prescribing.
After the release of a small clinical trial in France, Trump also trumpeted combining hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin, which is sold under the brand name Zithromax.
“HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” Trump wrote in a March 21 tweet. “Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents)….. ….be put in use IMMEDIATELY,” he added, referring to the journal in which the French study appeared.
But as we’ll explain, the trial has significant caveats and limitations — and far more data is needed to know whether the drugs are safe and effective to treat COVID-19.
In a press conference the following day, Trump exaggerated the existing evidence for the pharmaceuticals being sent to New York state for COVID-19 clinical trials. 
Trump, March 22: There’s been some tremendous signs that this could work. Now, again, you know, some doctors think it should go for years in testing. But, you know, this has been something that’s been around for many years. It’s been phenomenal — a strong, powerful drug for malaria. But we think it might work on this, based on evidence — based on very strong evidence. We’re going to see. We’re going to know on — you know, sometime after Tuesday.
It’s not clear which drug Trump had in mind, but New York state said in a press release that it received shipments of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and chloroquine.
Trump is entitled to his opinion of how the trials will turn out, but he overstates the evidence supporting the drugs, which is slim.
Lab Studies in Cultured Cells
At least two studies have found that hydroxychloroquine has antiviral effects against the new coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, in cells grown in the lab. Publishing in Clinical Infectious Diseases on March 9, researchers in Beijing found that hydroxychloroquine was better than chloroquine in preventing the virus from replicating in cultured monkey cells.
Another Chinese group reported on March 18 that hydroxychloroquine blocked entry of the virus into the same kind of cultured cells, and also appeared to prevent the virus from being released from cells. The drug, however, was less effective against the novel coronavirus than chloroquine.
These are suggestive findings, but as Peter Hotez, a professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us, the experiments by themselves don’t mean all that much. 
“Hydroxychloroquine has some activity in a test tube against the virus,” he said. “But it’s hard to know how that corresponds to clinical disease.”
In the past, for example, chloroquine has been found to inhibit a variety of viruses in cells, including influenza and chikungunya. But when tested in animals or people, those results didn’t hold. In fact, in nonhuman primates, chloroquine treatment made their chikungunya infections worse, not better.
The authors of the second SARS-CoV-2 report also cautioned that while hydroxychloroquine is usually considered less toxic than chloroquine, overdoses are still possible — and in their experiment, the drug killed a fair number of cells at the levels needed to produce antiviral effects. That feature, they wrote, “requires careful designing and conducting of clinical trials to achieve efficient and safe control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
The rest of the so-called evidence for hydroxychloroquine is largely anecdotal — essentially, people around the world trying it, and claiming it has worked. 
Trump, for example, tweeted a link to New York Post story about a 52-year-old Florida man with COVID-19 who said hydroxychloroquine had saved his life. The president later appeared to reference the man in his press briefing, falsely suggesting that the drug had been “approved” to treat COVID-19 “in record-setting time.”
But as Fauci has explained in press briefings, without a controlled clinical trial, in which a treatment group can be compared with a control group, it’s impossible to say whether the drug actually did anything — or whether the person improved for other reasons.
China has reportedly used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in some COVID-19 clinical trials, but most of those studies haven’t been published yet. 
One that has been published — a small randomized controlled trial of 30 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms — found “no significant reduction in time to clinical improvement or viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the conventional therapy control group,” according to a World Health Organization report. 
The authors of the trial concluded that the drug needed to be tested in a larger group of patients.
The French Study
It turns out that the French study Trump cited was, in at least one respect, less rigorous than the Chinese clinical trial. 
The study, which was done at a hospital in Marseille, France, calls itself a clinical trial, but it wasn’t a randomized controlled trial, and therefore, not the type of study that can actually determine whether a treatment is effective. 
Rather than randomly selecting which patients would receive the treatment — thereby minimizing any differences between groups that could affect the outcome — the study used those who refused the hydroxychloroquine treatment as the control group. Controls also included patients at other hospitals in southern France.
The study was very small, ultimately including just 20 patients who received hydroxychloroquine — six of whom also received azithromycin — to compare against the 16 patients who did not. 
The study also did not test for clinical outcomes. Instead, researchers measured the amount of virus in patients over time using nasal swab samples, and found that after six days, those treated with hydroxychloroquine had less virus and were more likely to test negative for COVID-19. 
According to the paper, on the sixth day, only two of the 16 untreated patients tested negative, compared with eight of the 14 hydroxychloroquine-only patients and all six of the dual-treated patients.
While the results may sound impressive, they don’t say anything about whether patients’ conditions or symptoms improved, and the lack of randomization means it’s not possible to attribute the differences in the virus amount, or what’s called viral load, to the treatments.
Many scientists identified other odd details and possible technical errors when they commented on the paper on the preprint site medRxiv. The paper, curiously, was posted on the preprint site on March 20, the same day it was published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, and had been accepted just a day after submission — raising questions about whether there was a peer-review process and how thorough it was.
The Immunology Institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine’s review noted that of the 26 original patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, six were lost to follow up, including three who transferred to the ICU, one who died, and one who decided to stop treatment because of side effects.
“Total length of clinical follow up was 14 days, but the data beyond day 6 post-inclusion are not shown,” the review reads, adding that the way the authors reported the viral loads was not standardized, making it “impossible to compare what is defined as a positive value between the patients in the control and treatment arms.” Many of the control patients also didn’t have nasal swabs taken every day.
Update, April 7: On April 3, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the French study appeared, issued a statement of concern about the paper, writing that the group “believes the article does not meet the Society’s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.”
On Twitter, Australian National University geneticist Gaetan Burgio lambasted the study, saying, “In short, all this hype on the clinical trial is based on a open label, non randomized and underpowered clinical trial on [hydroxychloroquine] treatment against #COVID19 with viral load as an outcome that was not properly measured in 2/3 of the control cohort !!!”
To at least some scientists, then, the outsized attention this particular study has received is unwarranted. But it’s important to recognize that even if the French study had been done perfectly and had been randomized, it still wouldn’t be particularly strong evidence that the drugs work, since the study is so small.
Baylor’s Hotez said that when small studies are repeated with more patients, the results often don’t pan out. This is a normal part of science, but it’s why scientists like to see larger clinical trials before concluding a drug is safe and effective.
“The likelihood that this is actually going to be a useful therapy is not high, but it’s not zero, either,” Hotez said of the drug combo. “So we’ll just have to see how it works in larger clinical studies.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several trials are planned in the U.S. to test hydroxychloroquine’s ability to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, this includes a 1,600-person prevention study for people exposed to COVID-19 patients in New York and a similar study by the University of Minnesota involving 1,500 people across the U.S. 
The World Health Organization is also coordinating a large multinational trial called SOLIDARITY, which among other potential COVID-19 treatments, will test chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
Other Considerations
When it comes down to it, Hotez is not especially optimistic about the drugs Trump has promoted, and said he’d prefer a different experimental therapy for COVID-19.
“If I was a patient or a family member, hydroxychloroquine and azithromax would not be my first choice,” he said. “My first choice would be the plasma convalescent antibody.”
The idea behind convalescent plasma — which is hardly new, having been used in the 1918 influenza pandemic — is to harvest antibodies from the blood of people who have been infected with the virus and have recovered, and infuse them into sick patients to help them fight off the virus. 
While the treatment doesn’t work for every disease and carries some risks, Hotez said it did work during the 2003 SARS epidemic, which was caused by a highly similar coronavirus. “And so this has a much higher probability of success,” he said.
It’s worth noting that although the drugs Trump has touted are generally well tolerated, they do have side effects, and it’s not clear if there might be more extreme or other negative effects specifically in COVID-19 patients.
As a March 24 viewpoint article in the Journal of the American Medical Association explains, it’s often assumed the benefits of “last resort” medications will offset the harms, but that’s not always the case. 
“A common interpretation of off-label use and compassionate use of drugs is that if the patient died, they died from the disease, but if the patient survived, they survived because of the given drug,” the article reads. “This is not true.”
According to the article, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can trigger abnormal heart rhythms and many of the sickest COVID-19 patients are elderly and may have heart problems, it’s possible the drugs could “increase the risk of cardiac death.” 
Still, given the circumstances, some U.S. hospitals have included these drugs in their COVID-19 guidelines, as they view the potential benefits to outweigh the risks. The U.S. Society of Critical Care Medicine, however, has neither endorsed nor advised against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, due to “insufficient evidence.”
More broadly, the promotion of unproven drugs for COVID-19 is having other unintended effects. In Nigeria, two people were hospitalized for chloroquine overdoses, and in Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine. Many patients with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, who rely on hydroxychloroquine to keep their symptoms at bay have also reported shortages of the drugs as orders related to COVID-19 have spiked. 
Without naming any names, in a March 23 editorial H. Holden Thorp, the editor-in-chief of the prestigious journal Science, cautioned against excessively hyping therapies that remain speculative. 
“Political overhyping of such approaches is extremely dangerous — it risks creating false expectations and depleting drugs needed to treat diseases for which they are approved,” he said. “And it sets science up to overpromise and underdeliver.”",Jessica McDonald,2020-03-25 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"The study, which was done at a hospital in Marseille, France, calls itself a clinical trial, but it wasn’t a randomized controlled trial, and therefore, not the type of study that can actually determine whether a treatment is effective. “This is not true.”

173,COVID-19 Nasal Swab Test Does Not Cause Risk of Infection,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/covid-19-nasal-swab-test-does-not-cause-risk-of-infection/,,"Quick Take
A viral Facebook post makes the false claim that the nasal swab test for COVID-19 damages the “blood-brain barrier” and can therefore lead to brain infections. Medical experts say the swab test is completely safe. 
Full Story
To help control the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended getting a COVID-19 test for people who show symptoms of the disease, have come into contact with someone known to have the disease, or are in vulnerable groups. 
The most common form of testing for the novel coronavirus involves the use of a nasopharyngeal, or nasal, swab. The swab reaches deep into the back of a person’s nose and mouth to collect cells and fluids from the upper respiratory system, which can then be checked with diagnostic tests for the presence of the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.
The testing procedure involves inserting a 6-inch-long swab into the cavity between the nose and mouth for 15 seconds and rotating it several times. The swabbing is repeated on the other side. The swab is then inserted into a container and sent to a lab for testing.
Dr. Shawn Nasseri, an ear, nose and throat surgeon based in Beverly Hills who has conducted many COVID-19 swab tests, told us in an email that the nasal swab “follows the floor of the nose and goes to where the nose meets the throat, or naso-pharynx.”
Asked if the swab test is safe, Nasseri said, “Absolutely. The biggest risk is discomfort. The rare person — 1 in thousands — passes out from being super sensitive or gets a mild nosebleed. It’s estimated that close to 40 million or more swabs have been performed safely in the U.S. alone.”
But in recent weeks, viral posts on Facebook falsely claim that the nasal swab test can cause serious health issues. One post says, “The stick deep into the nose causes damage to the hamato-encephalic barrier and damages endocrine glands. This test creates an entrance to the brain for every infection.”
The hamato-encephalic barrier, also known as the “blood-brain barrier,” protects the brain from toxins that could be present in the blood. 
Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of epidemiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, told us in an email that the Facebook claim “is not true.”
“I have heard about it before and consulted with neurosurgeons, neurologists and other physicians and no one has heard of this situation occurring or even likely,” Maldonado said.
Nasseri said that “it is incredibly implausible, if not impossible, to cross the skull base and blood-brain barrier with a swab unless someone uses a rigid metal instrument and is pointing the metal object 90 degrees in the wrong direction.”
Dr. Morgan Katz, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press that the Facebook posts misunderstand what’s happening when the swab test is performed.
The swab “would have to go through layers of muscle and fascia, as well as the base of the skull, which is a thick bone, in order to get anywhere near the blood-brain barrier, and I would say that it is not possible,” Katz said.

175,"Video Wrong About Fauci, COVID-19",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-video-wrong-about-fauci-covid-19/,,"
In a video titled “Fauci lied to you AGAIN,” conservative commentator Liz Wheeler makes a series of false claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the government’s most prominent experts on the coronavirus.
The Fauci-focused video, which runs nearly four minutes long and has accumulated more than 1.7 million views on Facebook since being posted in early January, also features Wheeler posing several questions about COVID-19 vaccination or mask use. As we’ll explain, her responses are misleading and contain inaccurate information.
Wheeler is a former television host on the One America News Network, a conservative cable channel known for being a favorite of former President Donald Trump and for spreading false information.
The Case Fatality Rate
The video starts with Wheeler falsely claiming that Fauci “lied” about the COVID-19 case fatality rate.
“First, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the COVID-19 case fatality rates was 3.6%. That turned out to be a lie,” she said. “The actual fatality rate of the virus is probably less than 1%.”
We could find no instance of Fauci misrepresenting the case fatality rate, or ratio, which is the percentage of those with confirmed cases who have died. In fact, we found the opposite.
Before the U.S. had even reported its first COVID-19 death, Fauci co-authored a Feb. 28 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine that said the case fatality rate is probably “considerably less than 1%.” At the time, the rate was about 2%. 
“If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%,” according to the editorial co-authored by Fauci and two others federal health officials, including the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Less than a month later, Fauci noted at a House committee hearing on March 11 that the case fatality rate then was up from 2% to 3% — but he still maintained that the true rate was much lower than that. Again, he stated that the case fatality rate misses “all the cases of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection.”
Fauci, March 11: Probably for the practical understanding of the American people, the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%. The stated mortality overall of this [the novel coronavirus], when you look at all the data, including China, is about 3%. It first started off as 2 and now 3. I think if you count all the cases of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection, that probably brings the mortality rate down to somewhere around 1%, which means it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. I think that’s something that people can get their arms around and understand.
It is important to note that the case fatality rate is a simplistic measure that merely divides COVID-19 deaths by confirmed cases. “The true severity of a disease can be described by the Infection Fatality Ratio,” which accounts for COVID-19 deaths “among all infected individuals,” as explained by the World Health Organization. It’s not lying when someone states the case fatality rate, whether it was 2%, 3% or 3.6%, and then explains why it is not an accurate measure of the severity of a disease.
False Claim About Lockdowns
Wheeler’s second purported Fauci “lie” concerns lockdowns.
“Fauci said lockdowns work. This was obviously false,” she said. “The places with the harshest lockdowns like Los Angeles and New York City have had the worst outcomes. And no, it’s not because they didn’t lock down soon enough. There is literally zero scientific evidence. And now, nine months into COVID-19, zero empirical evidence that lockdowns work to stop the virus.”
Certainly, there have been debates about whether and when to implement a lockdown — a nebulous term that has various meanings, but usually refers to movement restrictions and stay-at-home orders. Public health experts, including those at the World Health Organization, recognize that lockdowns impose high costs to society, and should be avoided whenever possible. But to claim there is zero scientific evidence that the measure works is inaccurate.
“Lockdowns are a very extreme form of the measures that we have seen have the desired effect throughout this pandemic. And there is scientific evidence that they work,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas at Austin’s COVID-19 modeling consortium, in a phone interview.
As one example, she pointed to a study her group published in Emerging Infectious Diseases that looked at data from 58 different cities in China early on in the pandemic. “We found a very strong data-driven statistical correlation between how quickly a city acted and how quickly they were able to bring the outbreak under control,” she said. 
Laura Matrajt, a research associate at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has modeled the effects of social distancing interventions, also told us Wheeler’s claim was “obviously … false.”
She pointed us to several studies to support the notion that lockdowns can be effective, including a rapid review of 11 European countries, which found that lockdown implementation was associated with a 82% drop in the effective reproduction number, or Rt. The measure refers to how many people on average each person with COVID-19 infects at a given time; a number above one indicates a growing epidemic, whereas a number below one means disease transmission is slowing and will eventually peter out.
According to the paper, the findings “suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive.”
A study analyzing data from Europe and the U.S. also concluded that lockdowns likely played “a key role” in bringing epidemics under control in many places by late April. “No state had an estimated Rt below 1.0 before lockdown,” the authors wrote, “but 29 states reached an Rt below 1.0 after lockdown.”
A paper published in June in the journal Nature likewise found that “major non-pharmaceutical interventions — and lockdowns in particular — have had a large effect on reducing transmission” of the coronavirus.
A string of other studies have found similar results and other fact-checkers have debunked claims about lockdowns being ineffective.
Meyers also batted down the notion that lockdowns don’t work just because some places with bad outbreaks have implemented stricter measures.
“If we look back at what happened in the spring wave and in New York, it was the growing threat to the hospitals, the growing numbers of cases that led New York to enact its spring 2020 stay home order,” she said, noting that in many places governmental restrictions are not full lockdowns. “That initial wave did subside after people started taking precautions and staying home.”
The same pattern repeated, she said, with the surge of COVID-19 cases in the Sun Belt and in Texas over the summer and with the spike in cases and hospitalizations this winter. 
“We’re seeing all over the country that as risks start increasing, policies and communication are put in place to encourage these behavioral measures,” she said, “and when they’re enacted and people adhere to those recommendations, the virus starts slowing.”
Fauci’s Comments on Masks
Wheeler falsely claims that Fauci admitted to lying when he initially said early last year that widespread use of face masks was not necessary.
She says: “Fauci also said, ‘masks don’t work, so please don’t buy them,’ he told us. This is actually probably true of cloth masks, but Fauci later admitted he lied to us to manipulate us into not buying masks so that there wouldn’t be a shortage for health care workers.”
First, Fauci did not say “masks don’t work.”
During an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” in March 2020, Fauci actually said that “masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.” But he added that face masks generally do not provide the “perfect protection” from getting infected “that people think” and so “there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.”
Fauci still said he was “not against” anyone wearing a mask “if you want to do it.” Although, he warned that if everyone wore them it “could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it,” particularly health care providers and people who were ill.
His comments were in line with CDC guidance at the time to conserve face masks for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and had symptoms.
Then, in April, after health officials learned more about how much the virus was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course and began recommending that everyone wear face coverings in public. At that point, Fauci, too, began encouraging universal mask use.
Fauci later explained the reversal in a June interview with TheStreet, in which he acknowledged that concern for medical workers was a major factor in the early guidance for the public not to wear masks.
Fauci, June 12: The reason for that is that we were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply. And we wanted to make sure that the people, namely the health care workers, who were brave enough to put themselves in a harm way, to take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus and the danger of them getting infected. We did not want them to be without the equipment that they needed. So there was not enthusiasm about going out and everybody buying a mask or getting a mask.
But that doesn’t mean Fauci “lied to us,” as Wheeler claims.
During a virtual event with the Washington Post in July, Fauci said that, in addition to wanting to preserve face masks for those most in need, health officials truly did not realize the degree to which infected people without symptoms were spreading the virus.
“I mean, back then, the critical issue was to save the masks for the people who really needed them because it was felt that there was a shortage of masks,” he said. “Also, we didn’t realize at all the extent of asymptomatic spread and that a person who could be without symptoms at all could inadvertently and innocently spread it to someone who was uninfected.”
Fauci added: “But what happened is that as the weeks and months came by, two things became clear: one, that there wasn’t a shortage of masks. We had plenty of masks and covering that you could put on that, plain cloth covering. That took care of that problem. Secondly, we fully realized that there were a lot of people who were asymptomatic who were spreading infection. So it became clear that we absolutely should be wearing masks consistently.”
Misleading Claim on Natural Infection
Wheeler proceeds to question why people who have previously had COVID-19 are being vaccinated — and in the process, misleadingly claims that natural infection is “better” than immunization.
“Why are people who’ve already had COVID-19 and recovered from it getting the vaccine?” she asks. “You might say, well, to protect against reinfection. But nope, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which followed 12,541 health care workers for 31 weeks after they’d had COVID, six months into the study they found natural immunization was solid. They found only two cases of asymptomatic reinfections. So why are we vaccinating people who’ve already recovered from COVID? They don’t seem to be at risk of reinfection and natural immunization is better than artificial immunization. It makes no sense.”
As we’ve written, many vaccines don’t provide quite as good immunity as that triggered by an infection, but that hardly means going that route is better, as contracting the disease is inherently risky. And there are numerous vaccines, such as those that protect against tetanus and human papillomavirus, or HPV, that produce superior immunity than natural infection. (For more, see our SciCheck story “Paul Misleads on Natural Infection and COVID-19 Vaccines.”)
For the coronavirus, it’s not yet known how immunity from vaccination compares with that from infection. Some initial signs suggest that the vaccines produce higher levels of infection-blocking neutralizing antibodies than those seen in patients recovering from COVID-19, but the strength and duration of immunity from both natural infection and immunization remain an area of investigation. Regardless, getting vaccinated is far safer than contracting the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. 
It’s true that people who have previously had COVID-19 likely have some immunity for a certain amount of time and therefore aren’t at high risk of becoming reinfected soon. For this reason, some experts have proposed that people who have had COVID-19 should not be prioritized for immunization.
But there’s no way to know for certain whether a person is immune — the so-called correlates of immunity have yet to be worked out for COVID-19 — and it’s unclear how long immunity might last.
As a result, the CDC website states, “Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, vaccine should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection.”
Elsewhere, the agency recognizes the lower risk to individuals who have previously had COVID-19, adding that it’s reasonable for people with infections in the last three months to choose to delay vaccination, at least while vaccines remain in short supply.
The CDC also advises that people with active coronavirus infections wait until they’ve recovered to receive a shot and for anyone who has received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma to delay vaccination for at least 90 days, as those therapies might prevent the vaccine from working.
It’s worth noting that even though the study Wheeler cited does suggest reinfection is rare, she botched some of the details. While 12,541 health care workers were included, not all of them had COVID-19. Instead, only 1,265 tested positive on a particular antibody test, suggesting they probably had been previously infected. Two of those individuals then went on to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a PCR test.
Misleading Vaccine Distribution Claim
Millions of health care workers have direct contact with patients and are at high risk of being exposed to the virus or becoming infected and then spreading it to others. But Wheeler suggests health care workers have been among the first to be offered the vaccine only because they tend to be “more racially diverse” than other populations.
“Why are young and otherwise healthy health care workers getting the vaccine before it’s offered to elderly people in nursing homes,” she asks. “It’s not because health care workers are at higher risk; they’re not. Elderly people are at the highest risk hands down. The only reason health care workers are being vaccinated first is because, as a University of Pennsylvania professor explained, health care workers are more racially diverse while nursing home residents tend to be white. So, in other words, the vaccine is being distributed according to critical race theory, not according to science.”
It’s true older individuals are at greater risk of being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19, and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted-living residences, have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.
But Wheeler simply ignores that the approximately 21 million U.S. health care workers — who work in settings such as hospitals, outpatient clinics and home health care — are a vulnerable group as well. More than 15 million medical workers — of whom 59% are white — are estimated to have direct contact with patients.
“Health care personnel’s race and ethnicity, underlying health conditions, occupation type, and job setting can contribute to their risk of acquiring COVID-19 and experiencing severe outcomes, including death,” the CDC explains. “By providing critical care to those who are or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, health care personnel have a high risk of being exposed to and getting sick with COVID-19.”
The CDC further notes that because those workers cannot “provide key services for patients or clients” if they contract the virus and become ill, “continued protection of them at work, at home, and in the community remains a national priority.” It also warns that workers who get COVID-19 can spread it to their colleagues, as well as those they are caring for, who may well have “underlying health conditions that put them at risk for severe COVID-19 illness.”


That being the case, the CDC, following guidance from the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommended in December that, in the first phase of the vaccine program, state and local officials prioritize giving the first doses available to both health care workers and those living in long-term care facilities. (According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, all 50 states and the District of Columbia are vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents and staff in Phase 1a. But 16 states depart from the recommendation in some way, primarily by including other groups to be immunized.)
The CDC and ACIP say the recommendations are based on “evidence-based information” about the coronavirus vaccines, with the goal of decreasing death and serious disease, preserving the function of society and reducing the burden COVID-19 is having on people already facing disparities.


As of Feb. 2, there had been over 391,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,343 deaths among health care workers, according to the CDC. But that may be an undercount.


In December, Kaiser Health News said its joint investigation with the Guardian found that “more than 2,900 U.S. health care workers have died in the COVID-19 pandemic since March, a far higher number than that reported by the government.”
The news site said those fatalities “have skewed young, with the majority of victims under age 60 in the cases for which there is age data.” In addition, “people of color have been disproportionately affected, accounting for about 65% of deaths in cases in which there is race and ethnicity data,” KHN said.
Faulty Mask Claim
Wheeler then goes on to distort a study to question why people who aren’t ill are told to wear masks.
“Speaking of science, why do people who aren’t sick have to wear masks?” she asks. “You might say, well, to prevent asymptomatic transmission. But no. A new study from the University of Florida’s department of biostatistics found that the secondary attack rate for asymptomatic index cases was not statistically different from zero.”
But that’s a misinterpretation of that research. The senior author of the paper, University of Florida biostatistician Natalie E. Dean, explained in a Twitter thread that her study “did not conclude ‘no asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread’ of SARS-CoV-2” or that “masks and lockdowns are pointless.”
The paper, which was published in the journal JAMA Network Open in December, synthesized and analyzed 54 previously conducted studies to better understand how infectious the coronavirus is within households. The studies provided estimates of the secondary attack rate, or how frequently the virus spread to others from an index, or initial, case.
One of several findings was that far more people contracted COVID-19 if the first infected person in the household had symptoms. Specifically, the secondary attack rate was 18.0% when the index case was symptomatic, versus 0.7% when the index case did not have symptoms.
While this does suggest that transmission of the coronavirus within households is more likely if a person is symptomatic, it does not mean that the virus is not spread from people who aren’t sick or that there’s no reason to wear a mask.
For one, as our colleagues at PolitiFact and the Associated Press noted when debunking similar claims based on the study, the paper itself cautioned that the secondary attack estimate for index cases without symptoms was based on just four studies — and concluded that “important questions remain” about infectiousness and symptom severity. 
The combined estimate also included studies assessing the attack rate for people who never develop symptoms, and are asymptomatic, as well as those who haven’t yet developed symptoms, but will, and are pre-symptomatic.
As Dean pointed out, it’s increasingly clear that people who never develop symptoms are less infectious, but pre-symptomatic transmission does occur — and even if less frequent than symptomatic spread, these modes of transmission can still be important to the pandemic. 
“If an asymptomatic person is far less infectious but has far more contacts than someone home with a fever,” Dean said, “it can come out in the wash.”
The attack rate estimates, too, are only for households, not for transmission in the community, which is more relevant to Wheeler’s complaint about people being told to wear masks in public.
Finally, while the mask guidance did shift in response to the recognition that people without symptoms can spread the virus — which by some estimates is quite common — that isn’t the only reason to wear a mask. As the CDC explains, some evidence suggests masks may also provide a degree of protection to the wearer as well.
“How well it protects you from breathing in the virus likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made (e.g. the type of fabric, the number of layers of fabric, how well the mask fits),” the CDC says.",Jessica McDonald,2021-02-03 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"In December, Kaiser Health News said its joint investigation with the Guardian found that “more than 2,900 U.S. health care workers have died in the COVID-19 pandemic since March, a far higher number than that reported by the government.”

176,"Fake Coronavirus Cures, Part 3: Vitamin C Isn’t a Shield",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/fake-coronavirus-cures-part-3-vitamin-c-isnt-a-shield/,,"1.6KQuick Take
Online posts claim that vitamin C can “stop” the new coronavirus. While it’s true that vitamin C can have a marginal effect on warding off a cold, there’s no evidence that it can stop or treat the new coronavirus.

Full Story
Treatments billed as miracle cures have cropped up across the internet since the new coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, at the end of December.
One rumor claims that consuming garlic will treat the illness, which the World Health Organization has now named COVID-19. Another would have people, essentially, drink bleach. Neither of these methods will treat or cure the virus. We’ve addressed why in separate articles.
Here, we explain yet another widely circulated claim that says loading up on vitamin C will do the trick. It won’t.
Vitamin C supplements can reduce the risk of catching a cold for those who also exercise a lot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Taking the supplements regularly can also shorten the course of a cold, but will not affect the length of a cold if they are taken only after the cold has started, the CDC says.
An article from Harvard Health Publishing gave the same assessment and quoted Dr. Bruce Bistrian, chief of clinical nutrition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, as saying, “The data show that vitamin C is only marginally beneficial when it comes to the common cold.”
However, a meme circulating on Facebook quotes a deceased doctor as saying, “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.”
That meme was posted by Andrew Saul, who also goes by the moniker, “The Megavitamin Man.” Saul wrote in his post, “The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped completely, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.” But there is no evidence that vitamin C can have an impact on COVID-19.
There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments that are recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus, according to the CDC. Patients, however, can receive supportive care to treat their symptoms.
Also, the new coronavirus hasn’t yet been classified as a pandemic, contrary to what Saul wrote. The World Health Organization declared it a public health emergency on Jan. 30.
Another similarly misleading post from Saul is also making the rounds on Facebook.
An article with the headline, “Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,” has been shared on a page called Healthy Families for God, which has a following of more than 36,000 users, and a page for the National Vaccine Information Center, which is not, as its name suggests, an official government agency. That group describes its mission on its 990 tax form as “advocating safety reforms in the mass vaccination system and endorsing independent scientific research into vaccine-associated deaths, injuries and chronic illness,” and it shares content critical of vaccines.
Despite its dubious claims about the powers of vitamin C, that article has amassed more than 7,000 shares on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle.

A meme with the false claim that “[t]he US is charging over $3,000 per test” for patients who may have COVID-19 has been circulating on social media. For now, the two agencies authorized to test for the illness are not billing patients.

Full Story
A baseless claim that it will cost patients in the U.S. more than $3,000 to test for COVID-19 has been circulating online.
As of now, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of two tests, one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and one from the New York State Department of Public Health. Neither agency is currently charging patients for the test.
The bogus claim originated on Twitter, where it has amassed more than 250,000 likes and retweets. Then it became a meme that spread on Facebook.
Although the writer of the tweet didn’t respond to our request for comment, it appears that the claim is based on a news story that detailed the experience of one man in Miami. The story, which first appeared in the Miami Herald, has spread widely as other news outlets have picked it up and, in some cases, used it to illustrate problems with the U.S. health care system.
According to the Herald, Osmel Martinez Azcue had been to China for work and returned to Miami in January with “flu-like symptoms.” He went to Jackson Memorial Hospital since he worried that he may have contracted the new coronavirus disease, now called COVID-19. The initial cost for his visit was $3,270, billed to his insurance company.
That total included an emergency room visit and testing for 22 upper respiratory pathogens, according to Lidia Amoretti, a spokeswoman for the hospital who answered questions from FactCheck.org by email. Azcue tested positive for the flu and, after hospital workers consulted with the Florida Department of Health, he was not tested for COVID-19.
So, this widely referenced case did not actually include testing for COVID-19.
As of now, the two authorized testing agencies aren’t billing patients for the tests. Jill Montag, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Health, told us by email that the state is paying for testing and a fact sheet from America’s Health Insurance Plans, a health insurance trade association, reported that the CDC isn’t currently charging patients. That could change, though. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has created a billing code for COVID-19 testing, and other labs could get emergency authorization from the FDA for testing.
Jennifer Kates, the director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in a phone interview, “there could be other costs incurred.” Visits to the doctor’s office and the emergency room can cost patients money, she said, noting that some high-deductible insurance plans could effectively charge patients who go to the ER $1,000 or more.
“This all comes down to coverage,” she said.

178,Viral Social Media Posts Offer False Coronavirus Tips,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/viral-social-media-posts-offer-false-coronavirus-tips/,,"Quick Take
Posts are circulating false and misleading tips on social media — in some cases wrongly attributed to Stanford University — about how people can monitor and avoid the coronavirus.


Full Story 
As the U.S. and countries around the world work to address the pandemic spread of COVID-19, posts disseminated by tens of thousands on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are feeding misinformation to people about how to avoid and self-test for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The posts provide a series of supposed tips about the virus, such as wrongly instructing people to hold their breath to gauge whether they’ve been infected and falsely suggesting that water consumption can kill the virus. Similar claims were promoted in a text-based image posted on the Instagram account of actress Debra Messing, which has since been deleted. They were also shared widely in screenshots on Twitter.
The posts in some cases cite “Taiwan experts” or “Japanese doctors,” and many begin by falsely sourcing the text to “STANFORD HOSPITAL BOARD.” Stanford Health Care has debunked that attribution. 

We consulted Krys Johnson, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University, who called the posts “deeply troubling because they make incorrect and dangerous claims.” She recommended people consult the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the World Health Organization, before spreading purported health advice.
Here are some of the claims from the posts, and why they’re inaccurate:
Claim: “Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.”



Facts: There’s no evidence to suggest this is a valid test for COVID-19. What’s more: “We know that people infected with coronavirus show symptoms within 14 days and that this virus can lead to severe complications,” Johnson told us via email, “but those are acute respiratory distress (not being able to breathe) and septic shock (the virus infecting your bloodstream), not fibrosis, as mentioned here.”
The CDC recommends seeking medical advice by phone if you develop the main symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough and shortness of breath — and have been in contact with someone who has the disease, or have recently traveled to an area experiencing a spread of the virus.
Claim: “If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold … Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.”
Facts: While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are “fever, tiredness, and dry cough,” according to WHO, some patients do have “aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.” Some who are infected don’t show any symptoms. Also, a WHO report said that, based on an examination of more than 55,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 33% had sputum (phlegm) production.
Claim: “Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus.”
Facts: The WHO has shot down this theory, saying that, “[w]hile staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.”
Likewise, Johnson said that the “moistness of your mouth and throat have nothing to do with the likelihood that you will develop disease, and simply drinking water to ‘rinse’ your digestive track will not prevent you from being infected or from getting sick.” Water consumption, she added, “has no bearing on the virus getting into your airways and lungs; if you breathe in an infected person’s respiratory droplets, the virus will travel through your airways.”
CDC officials recommend people clean their hands often, for at least 20 seconds — or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as an alternative — and avoid touching their faces and mouths. They also suggest social distancing, which can help curb the spread of the virus.
Claim: “This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees.”
Facts: What, exactly, these posts are referencing is unclear. The CDC has said it’s “not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.” We’ve previously written about how it’s unknown whether warming weather will help temper the outbreak.
The WHO has said there is “no reason to believe that this virus would behave differently in different temperatures.” Johnson noted that Italy “has a particularly mild winter and they have had widespread transmission of COVID-19, so it is unlikely that the outside temperature will affect this disease.”
More than 125,000 people across the globe have been infected by the coronavirus, leading to more than 4,700 deaths. We’ve reported on many falsehoods and misleading statements about the new coronavirus.

What’s more: “We know that people infected with coronavirus show symptoms within 14 days and that this virus can lead to severe complications,” Johnson told us via email, “but those are acute respiratory distress (not being able to breathe) and septic shock (the virus infecting your bloodstream), not fibrosis, as mentioned here.”
The CDC recommends seeking medical advice by phone if you develop the main symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough and shortness of breath — and have been in contact with someone who has the disease, or have recently traveled to an area experiencing a spread of the virus. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.”



Facts: There’s no evidence to suggest this is a valid test for COVID-19. We consulted Krys Johnson, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University, who called the posts “deeply troubling because they make incorrect and dangerous claims.” She recommended people consult the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the World Health Organization, before spreading purported health advice. The WHO has said there is “no reason to believe that this virus would behave differently in different temperatures.” Johnson noted that Italy “has a particularly mild winter and they have had widespread transmission of COVID-19, so it is unlikely that the outside temperature will affect this disease.”
More than 125,000 people across the globe have been infected by the coronavirus, leading to more than 4,700 deaths."
179,Viral Posts Mislead on COVID-19’s Toll on Health Care Workers,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/viral-posts-mislead-on-covid-19s-toll-on-health-care-workers/,,"Quick Take
Social media posts falsely suggest that meatpacking workers have suffered more COVID-19 cases than health care workers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there’s an increased risk for workers in both professions, but there have been significantly more cases reported among health care employees.
Full Story
Health care personnel have been on the front lines of the battle to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Each day they have direct or indirect exposure to infected patients or infectious materials. 
Despite their best efforts to protect themselves during the pandemic — made difficult due to widespread shortages in personal protective equipment — more than 9,200 health care workers had been infected with the disease in the U.S., as of April 17, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But viral memes on Facebook have spread misinformation about the impact the novel coronavirus has had on health care workers. In one post, a Facebook user shared a meme that read, “DON’T YOU FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING, THAT 5,000 MEAT PACKERS TESTED POSITIVE! HOWEVER, NOT 5,000 NURSES & DOCTORS!”
 A similar post was shared with the caption, “Ready for the food shortage?” — implying that a meat shortage is being intentionally planned. 
The meatpacking industry has been hit particularly hard by the disease. More than 4,900 workers at 115 meat and poultry processing facilities have been infected with the virus and 20 have died, according to a May 8 report released by the CDC. Several factors have played into the spike in infections in the food industry, according to the CDC, including “difficulties with workplace physical distancing and hygiene and crowded living and transportation conditions.”
COVID-19’s prevalence among food processing workers has caused a disruption to the industry. At least 30 meatpacking plants have closed at some point during the last two months, and the pandemic has caused a 40 percent reduction in pork slaughter capacity and a 25 percent reduction in beef slaughter capacity, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
In an effort to maintain the food supply chain, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on April 28 that resulted in the reopening of 14 meatpacking facilities. 
But UFCW International President Marc Perrone opposed the measure without safety improvements, saying meatpacking workers are “putting their lives on the line every day to make sure our families have the food they need,” and he called for more protection for employees of the plants.
Still, the memes’ statement that more meatpackers have been infected than doctors, nurses and other health care workers is incorrect, as we’ve noted.
More than 9,200 health care workers have been infected in the U.S., including 27 workers who have died, according to an April 17 report from the CDC. Those numbers are likely an undercount, the agency said, since only 16% of COVID-19 cases reported to the CDC included information on whether or not the patients were health care workers. The report also noted that health care personnel with mild or asymptomatic infections may have been “less likely to be tested, thus less likely to be reported.” 
A CDC spokesperson told us that the agency did not have updated information on the number of health care workers infected.
But the CDC has reported that the number of COVID-19 cases among health care workers “is expected to rise as more U.S. communities experience widespread transmission.”

180,Hoax Letter Stirs Confusion About Missouri Schools,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/hoax-letter-stirs-confusion-about-missouri-schools/,,"Quick Take
A false claim that students in Missouri will have to repeat the school year was pushed online through a viral letter with a state logo as part of an April Fool’s hoax. State officials have publicly debunked the claim.


Full Story 
A fictitious letter that circulated on Facebook as part of an apparent April Fool’s joke stirred confusion about whether students in the state would need to repeat the school year.
While many shared the phony letter in jest, the falsehood arrived amid the rapidly changing interruptions of everyday life in Missouri and across the U.S. as the country confronts the novel coronavirus outbreak. That combination worked to deceive some, apparently, and prompted state officials to publicly address the hoax.
The fake letter, dated April 1, claimed that “Missouri case law on education makes it very clear that if students can not take the necessary final exams in a class room setting & they can not complete the curriculum that was established at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year no one enrolled in a public school in the state of Missouri can be allowed to be promoted to their next grade level.
“This means that whatever grade each of your students started at in August of 2019 will need to be repeated,” it read.
The false claim was not unique — we wrote about a spate of similar April Fool’s headlines from a prank-generating website — but it went further by employing the official logo of the Missouri Department of Elementary & Secondary Education. The letter’s detail about final exams may have also been read as a reference to the department’s recent (actual) announcement to cancel statewide required assessments this year.
Mallory McGowin, a spokeswoman for the department, told us in an interview that the agency received multiple inquiries about the fake letter.
“We were getting approached by several different of our stakeholder groups inquiring about this or letting us know this was an issue unfolding pretty quickly,” she said. “Because of the current times, I think in some people’s minds, it seemed like it could be a logical conclusion from what’s been happening.”
“It seems particularly insensitive given the circumstances and given the anxiety and uncertainty that our students, parents and educators are already facing,” she added. “There’s really no room for that kind of misinformation to spread right now.”
The education department — and Gov. Mike Parson — took to social media to publicly debunk the letter.
“We could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as our students’ education,” the department wrote in part.
One Missouri principal commented and thanked the department for “clearing this up. I had parents very concerned. Not funny.” Other commenters deemed it an obvious April Fool’s prank and observed that the letter was signed by “Candice B. Fureal” (which sounds like “can this be for real”).
As of now, all of the state’s 555 school districts and charter schools are closed. The earliest some are currently permitted to reopen is April 6, but that is likely to change as the state navigates the outbreak. The state has reported more than 1,800 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, which caused the COVID-19 disease, and 19 deaths.

181,The Facts on Coronavirus Testing,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/the-facts-on-coronavirus-testing/,,"In the wake of an increasing number of new coronavirus infections in the U.S., federal officials have provided confusing and sometimes contradictory statements about the number and availability of tests to diagnose the new respiratory illness.
President Donald Trump claimed on March 6 that anyone who “wants a test can get a test,” while Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a television interview the same day that there “is no testing kit shortage, nor has there ever been.”
Contrary to both men, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories on March 9 that although things had improved since a week ago, “demand for testing is greater than the tests available.”
At the same time, at least one Democrat has exaggerated the problems. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden said on March 1 that the Trump administration didn’t “even have a test kit” for the new coronavirus. That’s not true. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is widely viewed to have bungled the rollout of its viral test kits, there was a test kit at the time, and it had been successfully used by the agency and some states.
The novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the pneumonia-like illness called COVID-19, which first appeared in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.
We’ll explain how testing works, what happened with the CDC’s coronavirus test and what’s known about how many tests are available in the U.S.
How does a coronavirus test work?
Most of the available diagnostics are molecular tests that use a standard molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect even a very tiny amount of the virus in a specimen.
The test takes advantage of some natural features of biology to essentially scan through all of the RNA present in a sample — such as a nose or throat swab, or some phlegm — and search for the presence of coronavirus RNA. The scanning happens with test components known as primers and probes, which are sequence-based, and therefore can be made specific to the virus. 
In those reactions, if the novel coronavirus is present in the sample, then a short snippet of DNA is copied many times over, which can be read out on a machine. If there is no virus — or if there’s a different virus, such as influenza — then no DNA fragment is made and there’s no signal to detect.
The CDC’s test was designed to use three main sets of primers and probes — two that match just the novel coronavirus, and one that matches a variety of highly similar viruses. Someone infected with COVID-19 should test positive for all three, while someone who’s not infected should be negative for all three. A person who has SARS would only test positive using the third primer and probe set, thereby offering a way to theoretically discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and other similar viruses. That concern, however, is hypothetical in this case, since there isn’t a known outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Eventually, the CDC will have a different so-called serology test that looks for whether a person developed antibodies in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The test, which does not need to be done when someone is actively infected, can yield a positive result whether or not someone developed symptoms. It therefore may provide answers about how many COVID-19 infections there were and how deadly the virus is in the larger population.
What went wrong with the CDC’s test kits?
Early on, all COVID-19 testing was done at the CDC with its own kit, and it performed well. The kit was successfully used to diagnose the first COVID-19 case in the U.S. on Jan. 20 in a patient returning from Wuhan to Washington state. A CDC report also notes that between Jan. 18 and Feb. 23, the agency tested 2,620 specimens from just over 1,000 people.
Problems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. Initially, the agency said it was releasing 200 kits — each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens — giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had been experiencing issues when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.
The CDC has not clarified exactly what the issue was, but has said that there was a manufacturing problem related to the third test component, which led to “inconclusive” results. The Association of Public Health Laboratories told us more specifically that a negative control, which should not have reacted to any of the primer and probe sets, was coming back positive for the third set, which was the test for all SARS-like coronaviruses.
For a while, the agency promised to re-manufacture the faulty third component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.
More than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix — labs could proceed without the third test, and just use the two other primer and probe sets to make accurate diagnoses. The agency also said that it had manufactured new tests with just the two components, omitting the third.
What other factors limited testing?
Other than the lack of CDC test kits, several other circumstances prevented wider scale testing early in the outbreak. 
One was the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested for the virus. At first, the CDC recommended testing only for those who had a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and had traveled to Wuhan or had contact with a suspected or confirmed coronavirus case.
In late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC guidelines were relaxed to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. Then, on March 3, Vice President Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test. 
The CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians “should use their judgment” in deciding who should be tested, keeping in mind the local epidemiology and COVID-19 symptoms — and strongly encouraging testing for other respiratory infections, such as influenza.
Another issue had to do with who could do COVID-19 testing. 
Academic labs and other similar facilities that had the expertise to develop tests were advised not to use their own tests for diagnosing patients until they sought permission from the Food and Drug Administration. As we’ve explained before, this is not a law but has been a de facto FDA policy. On Feb. 29, the FDA announced that validated in-house tests could be used for diagnosis immediately, as long as the agency received applications for the emergency use of the tests within 15 business days.
How problematic was the delay?
It’s not yet clear exactly what the delays meant for the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. But some experts say the lack of testing in many of the nation’s public health labs hampered early detection. 
The CDC reported the first case of possible community spread on Feb. 26, and the first reported death, in a Seattle suburb, followed three days later. It would later turn out that two COVID-19-related deaths happened as early as Feb. 26. A genetic analysis of some of the first cases in Washington state also suggested that the virus had been circulating undetected since mid-January. The state did not begin its own testing until Feb. 28.
Scott Lindquist, an epidemiologist with the Washington Department of Health, told the Seattle Times that problems with the CDC’s test kit “really did set us back, there’s no denying that.”
In a CDC telebriefing announcing the first U.S. death, Jeffrey Duchin, a University of Washington epidemiologist and health officer for Public Health Seattle and King County, noted that the patient who died had been tested locally, but only because the lab had just received kits and because of “very recent” changes in CDC criteria for testing. “If we had the ability to test earlier,” he said, “I’m sure we would have identified patients earlier in the community.”
With more available tests and less stringent clinical criteria for testing, the U.S. could have set up a more proactive system for detecting coronavirus cases, although it’s possible the outcome would still be the same. 
The CDC, in fact, wanted to set up a five- or six-site surveillance network in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City, which would begin testing for COVID-19 in people with flu-like symptoms who test negative for influenza. The plan was to then scale up the network to each state. But with the test kit difficulties, that schedule was set back. On Feb. 28, the CDC said that it expected to have the first of six sites up and running by the following week. When we asked on March 10, the agency did not have an immediate update on the program.
How many tests are available?
Throughout last week, officials gave confusing and conflicting answers about how many tests would be available — and when — in various appearances.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar said on March 1 that “we now have the ability to test 75,000 people in the field at this moment,” but later said that those tests would be shipped by the end of the week.
Vice President Mike Pence also at times referred to test kits, when he meant the number of people who could be tested, and said on March 4, “We’ll have over a million tests in the field today,” a statement that conflicted with other administration estimates of 1 million tests shipping out by the end of the week.
Part of the confusion has to do with the fact that testing is happening at several different levels — by the CDC, by state and local public health labs, and at hospitals and other facilities — and that the words used to describe the testing aren’t always consistent.
A test “kit” means an entire box of supplies to run tests to diagnose many people. A CDC test kit, for example, is able to test 700 to 800 specimens. Other test kits come with enough reagents for 500 “reactions.” Because controls need to be run, fewer than 500 samples can be tested with such a kit. And in both cases, the actual number of people who could be diagnosed with each will be lower, since patients may have multiple samples or samples may be run in duplicate. The same issue applies to the word “test.”
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn provided the clearest answer about testing capacity on March 7, when he said that the CDC had shipped enough kits to state and local public health labs to test 75,000 people for COVID-19. 
In addition, more than 1.1 million tests manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies had been shipped as of March 6 for non-public health labs to use, with another 400,000 possibly shipping by March 9. A separate manufacturer had also produced 640,000 tests that could have shipped as early as March 9, once quality control testing was complete.
“The actual number of tests that have shipped is larger than the number of patients that can be tested,” Hahn explained, noting that the approximately 2.1 million tests from IDT and another company would allow roughly 850,000 Americans to be tested.
On top of those tests, he added, would be any testing by commercial or academic labs, plus an expected additional 4 million tests from IDT and the other company by the end of this week. The CDC itself also can test approximately 350 specimens per day.
In a March 9 telebriefing, the CDC’s Nancy Messonnier clarified that the 75,000 people that can be tested using the CDC’s test kit in public health labs is a cumulative figure. She also said that in the coming weeks, as more manufacturers join the effort, the “majority” of testing will be from the commercial sector.
Several commercial companies have stepped forward to increase production. Quest Diagnostics said it could begin testing on March 9, and LabCorp said its test was available for ordering on March 5, with results taking three to four days once a specimen is received in the mail. 
Can “anybody that wants a test” get one, as the president said?
Not quite. On a March 6 visit to the CDC, Trump said, “Anybody that wants a test can get a test,” adding, “Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. We — they’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.”
When we asked the White House about this, the vice president’s office told us that tests were available through state labs, but that doctors needed to contact the state lab to get one. In other words, if someone wants a test, and a physician does not agree, a person cannot be tested.
This point was also made by Anthony Fauci, the director of the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on “Fox News Sunday,” when he said tests “are out there now,” but “it’s up to the doctor to order the test.”
It’s worth mentioning that even if a test has been shipped, it hasn’t necessarily been received or is ready to use right away; tests also take some time to complete, and so results may not be available immediately.
The CDC maintains that no person was ever denied a coronavirus test, nor was there ever a backlog at the agency. “Our guidance for who can be tested has always allowed room for clinical discretion,” said CDC press officer Richard Quartarone in an email. “That is, if a doctor had a patient who they wanted tested, CDC has not refused any of these requests.” The only exception to that, Quartarone told us, might be a damaged sample.
Some groups, however, dispute the idea that tests are fully available or that there has never been a shortage.
“We are now in the phase of the response where demand for testing is greater than the tests available, even when the private/commercial sector is doing testing,” Eric Blank, the chief program officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told us in a March 9 email. “So there is a test shortage but it is probably not as great as it was a week or so ago.”",Jessica McDonald,2020-03-10 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Scott Lindquist, an epidemiologist with the Washington Department of Health, told the Seattle Times that problems with the CDC’s test kit “really did set us back, there’s no denying that.”

182,Politicians Have Died of COVID-19,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/politicians-have-died-of-covid-19/,,"Quick Take
A meme circulating on Facebook falsely claims, “Not one politician has died from the virus.” Actually, at least five current or former politicians across the country have died due to COVID-19.
Full Story
More than 189,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19, so far — including some national, state, and local politicians.
But a meme is spreading this falsehood: “Not one politician has died from the virus, lost their job, or had their business looted.”
Dozens of copies of the meme — which shows actor Tommy Lee Jones reading a newspaper — have been circulating on Facebook since at least July. One early version that was shared 35,000 times features the name “Mike Rilling,” which is stamped on many right-wing memes shared from a Facebook account with that name. We wrote about another one that included a made-up quote attributed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2019.
When the meme started circulating in early July, two state representatives already had died. State Rep. Bob Glanzer, of South Dakota, died on April 3 and State Rep. Reggie Bagala, of Louisiana, died on April 9. Local politicians had died, too, including Michael Yun, a councilman in Jersey City, New Jersey, who died on April 6, and Marny Xiong, chairwoman of the board of education in St. Paul, Minnesota, who died on June 7.
Perhaps the most widely covered death of a politician came in late July, though, when former presidential candidate Herman Cain died from complications due to COVID-19 on July 30.
Also, at least one politician had his office looted. Rep. Brendan Boyle reported on June 1 that his district office in Philadelphia had been looted during protests that followed the death of George Floyd.
Despite easily accessed news stories that contradict the claim, the meme continues to circulate. On Sept. 4, Ben Swann — a purveyor of dubious claims and conspiracy theories that we’ve written about before — posted the meme on Facebook, with Rilling’s name removed. That version has garnered more than 3,500 shares.
But, as we said, it’s not true. Politicians have died during the pandemic, and many more have been diagnosed with the disease, including Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Bill Cassidy, and 14 U.S. representatives. The nonprofit, nonpartisan website Ballotpedia is keeping track of the deaths and diagnoses for public officials and politicians.

183,Reports Didn’t Misrepresent One Man’s Death as Two,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/reports-didnt-misrepresent-one-mans-death-as-two/,,"Quick Take
A bogus meme on Facebook suggests that the news media has tried to pass off one man’s death, attributed to complications from COVID-19, as two separate cases. But the headlines cited simply focused on different parts of his biography.


Full Story 
Thousands of Facebook users are spreading a false suggestion that two different headlines show that a man’s apparent COVID-19-related death has been reported by the news media as two different cases.
The news reports behind those headlines, however, show nothing of the sort.
“Corona is so bad, this guy died twice! #FakeNews” the viral meme reads. It contains two side-by-side, different headlines that were each paired with the same photo of the man, Lenard Wells, who died on March 21.
“69-year-old retired Milwaukee police lieutenant died from COVID-19,” reads the left headline, which we found was reported by FOX6 in Milwaukee.
The headline on the right, from KIRO-TV in Seattle (republished from Fox13 Memphis), reads: “University of Memphis professor dies from coronavirus, report says.”

But the stories both reported on the death of Wells; the headlines simply amplified different aspects of his biography.
Wells was an instructor at the University of Memphis and previously worked as a lieutenant for the Milwaukee Police Department. He worked on the force from 1973 to 2001 and also served as chairman of the State of Wisconsin Parole Commission, from 2003 to 2006, according to his curriculum vitae on an archived version of his website.
So the meme, not the news outlets, is spreading the misinformation.
One user wrote: “Same man, from Milwaukee, and again, same man from. Memphis, DIED TWICE, from Corona. Democratic Socialist Media is spreading Fear.” Another caption read: “Check out this fake media. Man dies twice in two different cities. Instead of one death now they have two deaths on the books for the scamdemic.”
The meme also shows an Instagram caption, from a user identifying herself as a family member of Wells, claiming he did not die from the novel coronavirus — it says “He had health issues way before this even happened!” and calls the media and government “fraud.”
A Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office representative provided FactCheck.org with a summary of its findings, which lists the immediate cause of death as “Complications of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.” The office made note of “Other Significant Conditions” including “Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary atherosclerosis, obesity.”
We tried to contact the Instagram user and members of Wells’ family to learn whether or not they dispute the office’s findings, but were unsuccessful.
Either way, the viral claim that the news reports have misrepresented one man’s death as two separate cases is undercut simply by reading the reports under the headlines.
The claim feeds into the unsupported theory that the official COVID-19 death toll has been inflated. As we’ve previously explained, experts actually think the official tally is likely an underestimate.
It’s worth noting that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that, based on current information, those “at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19” include those 65 and older, and people of all ages with underlying medical conditions — such as chronic lung disease, serious heart conditions, impaired immune systems, severe obesity and diabetes, among others.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, addressed the interplay of COVID-19 and underlying medical conditions during an April 8 press briefing.
“Those individuals will have an underlying condition, but that underlying condition did not cause their acute death when it’s related to a COVID infection,” she said. “In fact, it’s the opposite. Having an underlying condition and getting this virus, we know is particularly damaging to those individuals.”

184,Gargling Water With Salt Won’t ‘Eliminate’ Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/gargling-water-with-salt-wont-eliminate-coronavirus/,,"Quick Take
A viral image circulating online is falsely advising social media users that gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the coronavirus. There is currently “no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” according to the World Health Organization.


Full Story 
It’s worth reiterating again: Beware of posts on social media claiming to offer tips or cures for the novel coronavirus.
One of the latest falsehoods concerning the coronavirus to spread widely on Facebook and Instagram tells users, wrongly, that simply gargling water with salt or vinegar “eliminates” the virus.
The viral image spreading the claim erroneously purports that, “before it reaches the lungs,” the coronavirus “remains in the throat for four days” and that drinking a lot of water “and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.”

The World Health Organization, however, notes that “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus,” which causes the COVID-19 disease.
While saline water or water with vinegar is sometimes used to help soothe a sore throat, “it doesn’t kill the virus,” Charles Dela Cruz, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, told us.
“You’re not rinsing it away so it doesn’t go to your lungs,” Dela Cruz, also director of the university’s Center for Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment, said in a phone interview. 

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reports that symptoms — often fever, cough or shortness of breath — appear within 14 days of exposure.
As for actual advice, Dela Cruz said “the key is to limit getting infected.” He emphasized health officials’ guidance that people should frequently wash their hands with soap and water; avoid touching their faces; and avoid large crowds and close contact with people who are sick.

185,"Ahead of Trump Rally, Republicans Spin COVID-19 Metrics",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/ahead-of-trump-rally-republicans-spin-covid-19-metrics/,,"In the days leading up to President Donald Trump’s first campaign rally since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Trump and his supporters are making false and misleading claims about COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and testing: 

In a tweet, Trump claimed that the U.S. testing program “is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases.” Although the U.S. has completed the highest number of coronavirus tests, it still lags behind other nations in tests per capita, and a higher proportion of tests have also come back positive.
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow inaccurately said in a television interview that “hospitalizations may be going up, but that’s because elective procedures are now permitted.” COVID-19 hospitalization figures, which are increasing in some locales, are limited to those with COVID-19 diagnoses.
Vice President Mike Pence, Trump and Kudlow all suggested that the uptick in COVID-19 cases seen in some states is driven by increases in testing. Testing accounts for some of the rise, but doesn’t explain all of it.
Oklahoma, the site of Trump’s rally, has seen an increase in the number of people who are “currently hospitalized” with confirmed cases of COVID-19, state data shows. But GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma falsely said of his state: “We continue to see hospitalizations decline.” 
Similarly, Pence wrongly said that COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma have “declined precipitously.” The state Health Department reports that “Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases,” reaching a new single-day high on June 16.

Trump is set to speak at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20.
Trump’s Testing Tweet
In a June 15 tweet, Trump once again bragged about America’s ability to test for the coronavirus, leaving the misleading impression that better testing is responsible for the country’s large number of cases. 
“Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases,” he said. “Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases.”
Later in the day, Trump repeated the sentiment, saying in a roundtable at the White House, “If you don’t test, you don’t have any cases. If we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any.”
To some extent he’s right — if there were less testing, then the reported number of cases would be lower, although of course those infections would still exist. 
But experts say Trump is wrong to claim that the U.S. is more advanced on testing “than any other country.”
“The US may have done the most tests, but not the highest # of tests per capita. And our positivity is higher than many other countries,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Twitter in response to the president’s tweet.
“In summary: we still haven’t done enough testing for the size of our epidemic, which is largest in world,” she added.
As we have explained before, the total number of tests completed is not necessarily reflective of how well a country is meeting the challenge of diagnosing its COVID-19 patients. Typically, a superior indicator is tests per capita, which takes into account a country’s population. And even better is the test positivity rate, or the proportion of tests that are positive, which can show how much testing has been done relative to the size of an outbreak.
As of June 14 — the latest data available when Trump made his claim — the U.S. had completed just over 23.5 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project. 
That is the largest number of total tests performed by a single country, per statistics collected by Our World in Data. But it is not the top per-capita rate. On that metric, 16 other nations best the U.S., including Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Italy and Australia.
And with nearly 9% of all tests having come back positive, the U.S. is not even close to being in the vanguard for low test positivity: The U.S. ranks behind at least 50 other nations.
As we’ve mentioned before, there are limitations with the figures compiled by Our World in Data, since different countries report their testing statistics differently. So the numbers may not be directly comparable, but they are widely viewed as the best available international data on the subject.
A Johns Hopkins website that uses slightly different calculations based on daily averages — which Nuzzo told us was done because different countries are in different stages of their pandemics — also shows the U.S. lagging behind numerous other countries on per-capita tests, test positivity or both.
The website notes that countries’ testing programs “should be scaled to the size of their epidemic, not the size of the population” and says the positivity rate “is the most reliable way to determine if a government is testing enough.”
The World Health Organization suggested on May 12 that nations achieve a 5% or lower test positivity rate for at least two weeks before considering loosening public health measures.
The cumulative test positivity rate in the U.S. has yet to go that low, although the U.S. is close to reaching that two-week benchmark, as data from the COVID Tracking Project demonstrates. 
The national number, however, still obscures vast differences in locations across the country. A Johns Hopkins data visualization shows that as of June 16, 34 states plus Washington, D.C., have had 5% or fewer tests come back positive, as averaged over the past seven days, while 16 states and Puerto Rico are still above that level.
Kudlow’s False Hospitalization Claim
In an interview on CNN about COVID-19, Kudlow inaccurately attributed rising hospitalization numbers in some parts of the country to elective procedures. Those figures are specific to people diagnosed with COVID-19, and therefore are unaffected by elective procedures.
Kudlow also suggested that increased testing was responsible for the uptick in cases. But more testing only partially explains the trends.
Kudlow made his remarks in a June 14 interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper. 
He first acknowledged that some places in the U.S. have recently seen a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections.
“We have had an increase in cases in some states. I don’t want to hide that. That’s a fact,” he said. “I think Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina and Florida. There have been some small metropolitan areas that have had an increase.”
But then he pointed out that testing has increased, and said that hospitalizations were up because of elective procedures now being allowed.
“Now, remember, Jake, we are now testing at about a hundred times the rate we were back in March, when the pandemic first exploded,” Kudlow said. “[H]ospitalizations may be going up,” he added, “but that’s because elective procedures are now permitted. And maybe, most importantly, Jake, although the case rate has increased a bit, we’re not talking about a second round here.”
But hospitalizations are not up in some areas because of elective procedures. “States should be tracking COVID-related hospitalizations,” said Johns Hopkins’ Nuzzo in an email to FactCheck.org, “not all hospitalizations.”
And indeed, they are, although not all states report hospitalizations or document them over time. Texas posted a record-high of 2,287 “COVID-19 hospitalizations” on the day Kudlow made his remarks — a tally that has since climbed to 2,518, according to the state dashboard. 
The number is the sum of all “lab-confirmed” COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the state’s trauma service areas, which has risen nearly 40% since Memorial Day.
State data in Arkansas also shows a surge since the end of May, with 214 “currently hospitalized COVID-19 patients” as of June 16 — approximately double the number two weeks ago.
North Carolina, too, has seen a steady rise in the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations for the past month. The state notes that the figures reflect the “current hospitalizations due to COVID-19,” which are self-reported by hospitals.
There is another hospital metric — bed use rates, or hospital capacity — that could change as hospitals reopen and begin to do more surgeries. As Nuzzo said, “Bed availability is another element to track and that would be influenced by the resumption of elective procedures.” 
But even if that is what Kudlow meant — and we asked the White House for clarification, but didn’t hear back — it isn’t what he said.
Upticks in COVID-19 Cases Not Just Due to More Testing
Kudlow’s more fundamental claim, which Trump echoed and Pence also suggested, is that the increases some states are now seeing in their COVID-19 cases are because of expanded testing.
The New York Times reported on June 15 that Pence told governors in a private call to “make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,” and that in “most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that’s more a result of the extraordinary work you’re doing.”
In the call, Pence also repeated Kudlow’s false claim that “because people are going back to hospitals and elective surgery and getting ordinary care, hospitalization rates may be going up.”
At a roundtable the same day, the vice president said, “We really believe that the vast majority of new cases is a reflection, as you said, of a dramatic increase in testing.”
He then gave the example of California, which he said had flat hospitalization and test positivity numbers. “And in those areas where — just a few states — where we’re seeing positive rates go up, we’ll be talking to governors today, in states like Georgia and Arizona and Texas, about deploying additional CDC personnel to help them identify where those outbreaks are occurring and how we can mitigate those efforts.”
“With more than 22 million tests having been performed across the country, we — we continue to see overall that what’s called a positive test rate remains very stable in the country,” he continued. “As we said earlier, Mr. President, there is a few states where the positivity rate is climbing, and we’re working very closely with those governors to identify that.”
Pence is right that at least for now, the nation’s test positivity rate hasn’t gone up, and that California’s increased COVID-19 caseload is likely explained by bolstered testing. 
But that’s not true everywhere — and it’s not just a “few” states that have reported growth in their test positivity rates.
“It is true that the number of cases reflects not just how many cases there are in the community, but also testing capacity,” Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us during a press call. But, she added, “I think that the signals that we’re seeing from across the country are real, and they correspond to what we knew would happen when society started to open up, which is that we get more mixing, and we’ll start to see the emergence of the virus spreading again.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Wall Street Journal in a June 16 interview that while more testing leads to more cases, higher positivity rates in many states “cannot be explained by increased testing.”
“Testing positivity is going UP in nearly half of US states, which is a sign that increasing case numbers is not just due to more testing,” noted Nuzzo in a tweet.
Test positivity is an important metric because it should stay steady or decrease if increased testing is behind a higher number of identified cases. An increasing percentage of positive tests, as long as testing hasn’t dropped off, indicates a surge in infections.
According to a Johns Hopkins data visualization that tracks the weekly change in states’ test positivity numbers, many of the states with increases in the percentage of positive tests are located in the South.
Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted that testing could explain some — but not all — of the upticks.
“Are increased case counts partially attributable to increased testing?” she asked in a tweet. “Probably in part. But in places where hospitalizations and the % of tests that come back positive is high or rising, those are sure signs of trouble.”
In a June 11 call with reporters, Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, also emphasized looking at the hospitalization figures to understand what is happening — a point he later iterated in a Twitter thread.
“In Texas, if you look at the numbers in detail, you can see that hospitalization rate is going up. Similarly, in Arizona, ICU beds, hospitalization rates for COVID patients are going up. So those are real changes,” he said. “There are more sick people than there were a month ago, substantially more.”
He said California, though, did not have the same concerning trends. “In California, even though the number of daily cases is higher on a day-to-day basis than it was weeks ago, the overall hospitalization rate on their dashboard is stable,” he said. “So that would suggest perhaps there’s more testing going on in California and maybe they’re finding more mild and moderate cases, but they aren’t seeing a rise in the number of very sick people.”
“Other states like Florida aren’t reporting hospitalization,” he added. “So you can’t really make any determinations without having access to that data.”
Many public health experts suspect that reopening policies are behind the rise in some states, although Inglesby noted that not all states have experienced increases.
“In some cases, some states that have reopened have not had sharp rises. I think as reopening goes forward, we’ll be able to know more,” he said. “But what we do know is that this virus transmits person to person, the more activity that’s allowed that is based on close personal interaction, the more opportunities there will be for transmission.”
Buckee said it was too early to know what will happen for certain, but that the rising number of cases in some places will likely lead to more severe illnesses and deaths, even if it hasn’t shown up yet.
“I think that there’s no question that we’re going to see a surge in hospitalizations and deaths in places like Arizona, due to that uptick in cases,” she said. “It’s just a matter of waiting for a few weeks.”
Cases that happen now, she said, will result in deaths in about three weeks.
In addition to the increase in cases, she said many of the states in the southeastern U.S. have worrying demographic factors as well, which put those populations at higher risk.
“The concern is not just the policies and the reopening and spreading of the virus, but the significant risks of morbidity and mortality in those populations,” she said. “We know that African American communities are being hit particularly hard, diabetes is a risk factor, and so on. Those are all going to mean that we expect more illness and more death from COVID.”
Oklahoma’s ‘COVID-19 Current Hospitalizations,’ Cases Increase
On ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Lankford of Oklahoma was asked whether the president should postpone his Tulsa rally due to health concerns.
“I do not believe so, actually,” Lankford said. “We’ve gone through phase one, phase two, and phase three. We continue to see hospitalizations decline, deaths decline in Oklahoma.”
The senator is right about COVID-19 deaths, but not about hospitalizations.
In its most recent Weekly Epidemiology and Surveillance Report for the week of June 5 through June 11, the Oklahoma Department of Health said there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.
Oklahoma Department of Health, June 12: Oklahoma has begun experiencing over the past two weeks an increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, though the number of deaths have remained approximately the same and the percentage of positives remains low at 3.7%. The increase in the number of cases is caused by both ongoing community transmission and outbreaks that affect specific populations. The threat of COVID still exists and we anticipate it to grow.
For the two-week reporting period, from June 1 to June 12, the number of “COVID-19 Cases Currently Hospitalized” increased from 69 to 86, according to separate Executive Order Reports that the state Health Department publishes every weekday.
As of June 15, there were 98 current hospitalizations — the highest since May 7, when there were 113 people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, which tracks hospitalization data for 42 states, including Oklahoma.
Prior to Lankford’s appearance on “This Week,” the Executive Order Reports showed a one-day drop on June 11, from 97 to 86. But, until the June 11 drop, there were six straight days of more COVID-19 hospitalizations, the reports show.
The most recent weekly epidemiology report also said there were 719 confirmed cases for the week ending June 11, an increase of 12.9% from the previous week, while deaths had declined 11.6%.
Despite the current uptick in COVID-19 hospitalizations, there are still far fewer than there were in mid-April, according to the Carlson School of Management’s hospitalization tracking website. The Sooner State recorded the highest number of hospitalizations on April 13, when 194 people were hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the university website.
(Technical note: The state also issues “situation update” reports every weekday that provide “current hospitalizations,” which the state Health Department says represent “a combination of hospitalized positive cases and hospitalized persons under investigation.” The Carlson School’s website reports “only the confirmed cases of hospitalizations” when a state provides the data, as Oklahoma does, according to Pinar Karaca-Mandic, a professor of health care risk management and a project team leader. We, too, are using only confirmed cases for this story.)
Oklahoma has been slowly reopening its businesses since April 24, when it entered what Gov. Kevin Stitt called phase 1 of a three-phase plan. The state fully opened for business on June 1.
“Under Phase 3, businesses may resume unrestricted staffing at their worksites by observing proper CDC-recommended social distancing protocols and are recommended to continue increased cleaning and disinfecting practices,” according to a press release issued by the governor’s office. “Individuals should minimize time spent in crowded environments and continue following CDC guidelines regarding social distancing.”
Despite the state’s advice to “minimize time spent in crowded environments,” Trump said he expects to fill the BOK Center, which seats about 19,000, and is looking for a second location to increase capacity for the event.
“We have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we’re going to also take the convention hall next door, and that’s going to hold 40,000,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on June 15. “So we’ll have 22,000 plus 40,000. … [I]t’s an amazing — nobody has ever heard numbers like this. I think we’re going to have a — we’re going to have a great time.”
At the same Cabinet meeting, Pence expressed confidence about Oklahoma’s ability to host the rally, in part because COVID-19 cases in the state have “declined precipitously.”
Pence, June 15: The number of cases in Oklahoma — it’s declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend.
That’s false. As we stated earlier, the state reports that the number of COVID-19 cases is now on the rise in Oklahoma.
In its weekly epidemiology report for May 29 through June 4, the state Health Department said there had been “637 confirmed cases in the past week 8.0% increase from the week before (May 22-28).” A week later, the department said that from June 5 to June 11 there had been “719 confirmed cases in the past week 12.9% increase from the week before (May 29-June 4).”
A day after Pence’s remarks, the state recorded a single-day high of 228 new cases on June 16, as well as four deaths.
As of June 11, at the time of the last weekly report, the state had 7,626 confirmed cases. As of June 16, Oklahoma had 8,645 confirmed cases — an increase of 1,019 cases, the daily state data shows.

Pence is right that at least for now, the nation’s test positivity rate hasn’t gone up, and that California’s increased COVID-19 caseload is likely explained by bolstered testing."
186,FactChecking Trump’s Immunity Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/factchecking-trumps-immunity-claims/,,"During a campaign rally, President Donald Trump said that once he came down with COVID-19, people for partisan reasons shifted from saying immunity was lifelong to saying it lasted only a few months. Experts, however, haven’t changed their estimates for immunity duration, which remains unknown — but unlikely to be lifelong.
The president also has repeatedly declared himself “immune” to COVID-19 following his illness. That’s a reasonable assumption — at least for now — but whether he’s actually resistant to a second infection isn’t known. And his unique treatment regimen could mean his potential immunity is more fleeting than that of most other people who have recovered from the coronavirus.
Trump first alleged that COVID-19 immunity estimates changed in an Oct. 13 rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after asking the crowd who else had caught the coronavirus.
Trump, Oct. 13: Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who’s had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you’re the people I want to say hello to because you’re right now immune. You’re right now immune. Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, “Well, if you have it, you’re immune for life,” right? Once I got it, they give you four months. … It’s anybody else but me, you’re immune for life.
In subsequent news interviews, the president repeated the claim.
“All I know is I got better very quickly, and I feel very good. I mean, really good. Totally negative, and, uh, you know, I guess you have immunity for a certain period of time, too,” Trump told Newsmax’s Greg Kelly in an Oct. 14 phone interview. “Uh, it used to be for life, until I got it. Now, when I get it, they say it’s only four months, you know. In other words, it was somebody else’s that was for life, but, uh, but I have immunity, I guess.”
Trump stuck with that story the next day, in an interview with Fox Business’ Stuart Varney. 
“And we’re going to have — there’s — like I have immunity now, and I don’t know, they — I hear from anywhere from four months to a lifetime,” he said. “It’s sort of interesting, as soon as I beat it they said, no, he’s only immune for four months. I said, well, I always heard for a lifetime, but that’s OK, you know. If it was anybody else — hey, Stuart, if it was you, they’d say, yes, he’s immune for his lifetime. But with me, they say four months. You know, they want to make it look as bad as possible.”
It’s not clear who “they” are when Trump is speaking, but scientists don’t know with any certainty how long any possible immunity to the coronavirus lasts because the virus, SARS-CoV-2, is so new. 
“There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity,” explains a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage updated on Oct. 14. “Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this.”
Even from the beginning, experts did not expect immunity to be lifelong. As we explained back in April, based on what is known about other human coronaviruses, immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to last only a few years at most.
“Reasonable guesses are that on the short end there might be partial protection for about a year or close to a year. And on the long end it might be longer — it might be several years of good protection,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist and director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, in a call with reporters earlier this spring.
A standard proxy for immunity is the presence of Y-shaped immune proteins known as antibodies, especially so-called neutralizing antibodies that can glom on and clear invading viral particles even before the virus can enter cells. 
Lab tests, for example, can evaluate whether antibodies demonstrate neutralizing activity in a test tube. But as we’ve explained before, those tests aren’t routinely done — and even if they are, there’s still no guarantee that those antibodies will be functional and prevent an infection. That’s why scientists remain cautious about saying someone with antibodies is even temporarily immune — even though it’s likely.
So far, data suggest that most people generate antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that those molecules persist for at least a few months, although some studies have reported more limited durations. 
An unpublished study in New York City, for example, found that 95% or more of people with confirmed coronavirus infections developed antibodies — and that neutralizing antibodies stuck around for at least three months. Similarly, a study in Iceland found that 91% of recovered COVID-19 patients developed detectable antibodies, with levels remaining steady for four months.
How much longer the antibodies might last is unknown, and only time will tell. 
Antibodies aren’t the only consideration for immunity, as we’ve noted before. Other immune cells known as T cells also contribute, so even if someone doesn’t have antibodies anymore, they could have some degree of protection. And the B cells that make antibodies also typically stick around, ready to pump out antibodies more quickly if they encounter the pathogen again. Initial data indicate that these cells are also present for at least three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
While the evidence suggests that most people who have come down with COVID-19 will be protected against contracting the virus again for at least several months, there are several case reports of individuals becoming reinfected.
Immunologists do not think this phenomenon is common, as there are fewer than five confirmed reports out of nearly 40 million infections worldwide. But it does show that individual responses to the virus can vary — and that even temporary immunity is not a given.
Trump’s Unique Situation
Because there is no way to know for certain whether a person is immune — short of trying to purposely reinfect someone — it’s impossible to know whether Trump is right when he says he has immunity.
The president has claimed to be immune on multiple occasions following his Oct. 5 release from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he stayed for three nights to treat COVID-19.
In an Oct. 11 tweet, which Twitter flagged for spreading misinformation, Trump claimed to have received a “total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday,” adding, “That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!”
At his Johnstown rally two days later, Trump said, “And now I’m immune, they tell me I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman.”
Trump very likely is protected for now, but the fact that he received Regeneron’s experimental antibody cocktail as a treatment for his disease could mean that in the future, he could become susceptible again more quickly than most other COVID-19 patients.
As the New York Times reported, it’s possible that the antibody infusion prevented him from mounting his own antibody response — and that when the synthetic proteins clear from his body, he may be no longer protected.
Trump also received the steroid dexamethasone, which might also mute the body’s natural immune response.
According to information released by the White House, Trump probably did not start to make antibodies on his own prior to the Regeneron infusion. An Oct. 7 memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, the president’s physician, states that the president had “detectable levels” of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on Oct. 5, but not on the night of Oct. 1. Trump received the Regeneron antibodies the following day.
Regeneron told us in an email that antibody levels remain high one month after infusion — so protection would be expected to last at least that long — but declined to speculate further. 
A company document shows that at the 8 gram dosage the president took, it takes 18 days for one of the antibodies in the cocktail to decline by half, and 25 days for the second antibody, which suggests the drug could be given once a month. More data on the length of protection, a spokesperson said, would be forthcoming in the ongoing clinical trials.
We cannot know if Trump’s natural immune response was hampered by the drugs he took or not. But regardless of his immune status, the same public health recommendations still apply.
The CDC recommends that all people, “whether or not they have had COVID-19, take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19,” including washing hands, practicing physical distancing and wearing a mask.

187,Trump’s False Claims about Pelosi and Chinatown,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-false-claims-about-pelosi-and-chinatown/,,"President Donald Trump is making false and exaggerated claims about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Feb. 24 trip to San Francisco’s Chinatown. Pelosi urged people to shop and eat there at a time when tourism was suffering because of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year.

Trump falsely tweeted that “Crazy Nancy Pelosi” had deleted a video from Twitter of her visit to Chinatown. “She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA,” Trump said. But there is no record such a video was ever posted on Twitter by Pelosi.
At an April 13 coronavirus briefing, Trump falsely claimed that during her visit Pelosi said, “‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade.'” Pelosi didn’t say that. In fact, that parade had taken place on Feb. 8, more than two weeks before Pelosi went to Chinatown.
At a coronavirus briefing on April 15, Trump exaggerated when he said Pelosi “was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.” Pelosi didn’t mention parties during her visit, although she urged people to come to Chinatown to shop and eat.
Trump also falsely said Pelosi visited Chinatown “to show that this thing doesn’t exist,” referring to the novel coronavirus. Pelosi never suggested that it didn’t exist. She stressed the need for “prevention, prevention, prevention” — urging people to be “concerned and vigilant,” but not “afraid.”

The president has raised Pelosi’s visit several times in recent days to counter criticism that he was slow to react to the coronavirus. He repeatedly mentions that he issued travel restrictions on China, which he did on Jan. 31. Meanwhile, he points out, the House speaker was urging people to go to Chinatown.
Trump is mischaracterizing and exaggerating what she said during her visit. And while Trump did issue the travel restrictions, as we have reported, he also downplayed the danger of the virus in a series of remarks and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10.
The California Democrat’s visit to Chinatown came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the same day as Pelosi’s visit, Trump tweeted, “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”
Here’s Trump’s April 16 tweet accusing Pelosi of deleting a video from her Twitter account:

Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent, third-rate politician! pic.twitter.com/uWNI7DCG3o
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2020

We could find no record that the video was ever posted on Pelosi’s Twitter account.
We checked Politwoops, a project of ProPublica that preserves tweets deleted by politicians, and there’s no record Pelosi deleted a tweet of the video, nor a record of her deleting a tweet about the Chinatown visit. The Internet Archives’ Wayback Machine captured an image of Pelosi’s Twitter page on Feb. 27, and that, too, shows no tweet of the video. Pelosi still has a tweet about her Chinatown visit on her Twitter feed.
Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill tweeted that Pelosi’s office hadn’t posted it. “Fact check: We never posted this video. It’s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco….”
Pelosi explained at the time that she was making her Chinatown visit “to say to everyone: we should come to Chinatown.”
Pelosi, Feb. 24: Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern surrounding tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. It’s lovely here. The food is delicious, the shops are prospering, the parade was great. Walking tours continue. Please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.
So, Pelosi mentioned the Chinese New Year parade. But she did not say, “‘Let’s all have the big parade — Chinatown parade,'” as Trump maintained during the April 13 coronavirus briefing. In fact, the parade occurred on Feb. 8. 
And, while she encouraged people to “visit and enjoy Chinatown” and called it “very safe,” Trump went too far in saying at his April 15 briefing that Pelosi “was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.” Pelosi didn’t mention parties during her visit.
As for the coronavirus, Pelosi didn’t deny its existence — contrary to Trump’s remarks — while visiting Chinatown. She struck a middle ground. “Prevention, prevention, prevention. We want people to be concerned and vigilant,” she said. “However, we don’t want them to be afraid.”
During her excursion, Pelosi was asked if it was irrational for people to stay away from Asian-American-owned businesses in San Francisco and elsewhere.
“Well, that’s one of the reasons we are here today,” she replied. “It doesn’t make any sense, but it’s not just Asian-owned now. You see in Italy where the shows – the fashion shows and all of that were done without an audience because people – they just didn’t – because people were not coming. So, again, this fear is – I think – unwarranted in light of the precautions that are being taken here in the United States.”
But in response to a question, Pelosi rejected the notion that racism was the reason people were avoiding Asian businesses.
“I don’t know that,” she said. “But, I do think that because it started in China, there’s a concern that are the – is the Chinese government doing what it needed to do early enough, and now as we go forward. But that should not be carried over to Chinatown and San Francisco.”
Asked whether she felt the federal government was doing enough to control the virus, Pelosi said, “I have confidence in Dr. [Anthony] Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, who has even further confidence in what we’re doing.”
Trump and Pelosi have long had a frosty relationship, one that wasn’t warmed up by the impeachment battle. And the president has bristled at her criticism that he was slow to react to the threat of the novel coronavirus. On March 29, on CNN’s “State of the Union,” she said, “his denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where — it continues — his delay in getting equipment to where it’s needed is deadly.”
Trump returned fire the following day in an interview on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” assailing Pelosi as a “sick puppy.”
To sum up: Pelosi did visit Chinatown in late February in an effort to encourage people to go there to eat and shop. But she did not support parades or parties, try to show the coronavirus didn’t exist or delete a tweet of her visit, as Trump claimed.",Rem Rieder,2020-04-16 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"And, while she encouraged people to “visit and enjoy Chinatown” and called it “very safe,” Trump went too far in saying at his April 15 briefing that Pelosi “was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown, because she thought it would be great.” Pelosi didn’t mention parties during her visit.

188,Kennedy Center Didn’t Contribute to Democrats,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/kennedy-center-didnt-contribute-to-democrats/,,"Quick Take
Online posts falsely claim that the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts donated $5 million to Democrats after it was allocated $25 million in the COVID-19 stimulus package. The center has not given any political contributions; it’s prohibited by law.

Full Story
The stimulus package that passed with bipartisan support in March to ease COVID-19’s crippling effect on the economy included $25 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Shortly after that bill — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — became law, rumors started circulating online that the Washington D.C.-based arts center had given a $5 million contribution to Democrats.
One popular version of the rumor started on Twitter and later migrated to Facebook as a screenshot meme, framing the bogus claim this way:

Like a lot of misinformation that gets traction online, this tweet surrounded the falsehood with facts.
It’s true that the Kennedy Center finished a $250 million expansion in 2019 and that it got $41 million in federal funding for fiscal year 2019. That was the center’s annual  appropriation for operations, maintenance and repairs, which it gets since it serves as a memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Most of the center’s budget comes from its programming income and philanthropic donations, as well as some other sources, such as gift shop sales. Those brought in a combined $216 million in fiscal year 2019.
It’s also true, as we said, that the Kennedy Center has been allotted $25 million in the stimulus package. That money is “to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally,” according to the law, which specifies “deep cleaning” and “information technology to improve telework capability” as uses for the funds.
President Donald Trump, who signed the act on March 27, defended the inclusion of the Kennedy Center in the stimulus package at a press briefing a few days before that, saying, “[T]hey’ve been essentially closed.  They have tremendous deficits that are built up. I mean, this thing has been devastating to it.”
But the primary claim made in the tweet is not true. The Kennedy Center didn’t give $5 million to the Democratic National Committee, nor is it true that it “launders taxpayer money for the Democrats.”
The Kennedy Center is registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the Internal Revenue Service and, according to the IRS, those tax-exempt charitable organizations are barred from making political contributions.
Just to be sure, we searched the Federal Election Commission database for political contributions and found no record for political spending of any kind from the Kennedy Center going back as far as online records are available, which is 1980.
Employees of the center are, of course, eligible to make political donations. But any such individual contributions would come from their own money, not the center’s funds.
The writer of the original tweet, conservative content creator Cari Kelemen, later added a clarification that said: “[M]y original tweet should have said: *Tomorrow* donates $5 M to the DNC. It was meant as a next-step hypothetical.”
But that hasn’t stopped others from taking the original claim and repeating it in new posts.

189,Dems Misconstrue Trump Budget Remarks,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/dems-misconstrue-trump-budget-remarks/,,"After President Donald Trump said, “I don’t know anything about” the disbanding of a White House pandemic response office, the Democrats claimed that he “lied” and pointed to Trump’s earlier remarks about “some of the people we cut” as evidence. But those remarks were in response to a question about proposed budget cuts — not the anti-pandemic team in question.
Several Democrats have criticized the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak by pointing to the dissolving of a team within the White House’s National Security Council dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic. As we’ve written before, in 2018, the administration did eliminate a key position that would have been involved in such a response — the senior director of the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense. But that doesn’t mean the responsibilities of that office were eliminated.
Administration officials have described a reorganization or streamlining of the NSC. An NSC spokesman told the Washington Post in May 2018 that the administration “will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure.”
Some still have been critical of the elimination of the post or a separate global health team. For instance, the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended in a November 2019 report restoring the position on the NSC as one of seven key changes to better protect the American public from global health threats.
In a March 13 press conference, the president was asked “what responsibility do you take” for the “disband[ing]” of the White House pandemic office, and he responded that he “didn’t know anything about it.”
“And when you say ‘me,’ I didn’t do it,” the president said. “I could ask perhaps — my administration — but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don’t know anything about it. I mean, you say — you say we did that. I don’t know anything about it.”
(Trump’s mention of “Tony” was a reference to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.)
The reporter made clear she was talking about “the reorganization that happened at the National Security Council,” and Trump added: “It’s the — it’s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go.”
The next day, March 14, the Democratic National Committee tweeted: “Yesterday, Trump said he didn’t disband the government’s pandemic response team. He lied. Here he is earlier this year defending doing just that.”
The accompanying video showed Trump saying: “Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.”
But those remarks came in a Feb. 26 press conference after Trump was asked about his proposed budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.
Reporter, Feb. 26: Your budgets have consistently called for enormous cuts to the CDC, the NIH, and the WHO. You’ve talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent, have been critical and necessary. Does this experience at all give you pause about those consistent cuts?
Trump: No, because we — we can get money and we can increase staff. We know all the people. We know all the good people. It’s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them.
When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we’re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this, you know, great government that we have, and very specifically for this. We can build up very, very quickly. And we’ve already done that. I mean, we really have built up. We have a great staff.
Trump doesn’t say to whom he’s referring in talking about staffing cuts, but the question was about his proposed budget cuts, not the National Security Council global health security team. The NSC was not mentioned in the reporter’s question or Trump’s answer.
As we’ve said before, Trump has consistently proposed budgets that would cut funding for the CDC and NIH, but Congress hasn’t enacted those proposals. The CDC’s staff has decreased by 591 positions, or 5.4%, from December 2016 through March 2019, the most recent data available from the Office of Personnel Management.
Daniel Wessel, a spokesperson for the DNC, told us that Trump didn’t answer the question that was asked and was likely talking about the NSC issue, which had been in the news that day.
“Trump was not answering the question that he was asked, so we should not be held to the standard of what the question was,” he said in an email. “Trump’s response on the day that headlines were breaking about the decision by his NSC to cut the pandemic response team was just as likely (probably more likely) about the pandemic response team than anything else.”
Wessel added that the point of whether Trump “lied … is moot,” saying there have been several news stories “that showed Trump’s administration and NSC led by John Bolton did indeed dismantle the pandemic response team in the spring of 2018.”
Zach Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told us: “As the full video makes clear, at no point in this exchange was the National Security Council or the Global Health Security Directorate team mentioned. The President was specifically asked about his proposed budgets, not any personnel reorganization or actions.”
Parkinson also said the claim that the NSC team was eliminated is “false,” saying, “former and current National Security Council officials have repeatedly said the team working on biodefense is still at the NSC.”
Others on Twitter, including celebrities and journalists, have retweeted a March 17 article by the Independent, a U.K. publication, that also linked Trump’s Feb. 26 remarks to the NSC issue. The Democratic group Protect Our Care pointed to that article and wrongly said Trump made these comments “in 2018.”
The Atlantic, also citing the Independent story, initially said the president’s remarks were from 2018 but later corrected that.
The Independent story didn’t say the video was from two years ago but may have left that impression. “A video has emerged of Donald Trump talking about cutting the US pandemic response team in 2018,” it said. The date pertains to the cutting, not the video, which is merely a few weeks old.
What Happened with the NSC Team?
As we explained in a March 3 story, the administration did eliminate a key position at the NSC but that doesn’t mean the entire “team” was “fired,” as then-Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg said, or that all of the functions of the office were eliminated.
The Washington Post reported in May 2018 that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton dissolved the NSC’s Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense in a reorganization effort. Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer left his post as senior director of that office and wasn’t replaced.
President Barack Obama had created the NSC unit in 2016 after the yearslong Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Trump appointed Ziemer as senior director in April 2017, but Ziemer left about a year later. He now serves as senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance at USAID.
The Post said this was part of a “reorganization” by Bolton and quoted an NSC spokesman as saying “global health, global health security and biodefense” would be addressed “under the new structure.” The Atlantic also reported at the time that some team members were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of Ziemer’s duties. 
Tom Bossert, a former White House homeland security adviser who helped develop the Trump administration’s biodefense strategy and was the designated lead for coordinating the American response to a biological crisis, was also reportedly pushed out of the NSC when Bolton took over. Bossert resigned in April 2018, a day after Bolton started as national security adviser.
Bossert was replaced with a series of people, but when Trump announced his coronavirus task force on Jan. 29, he did not name current homeland security adviser Julia Nesheiwat in any capacity.
Bolton, as well as Tim Morrison, former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense for the NSC, also have described the moves as a restructuring or consolidation. What was the Office of Global Health Security and Biodefense became part of the directorate on counterproliferation and biodefense.
Morrison objected to claims that the office was “dissolved,” writing in the Post on March 16 that the administration “create[d] the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented.”
Morrison led that directorate for a year, he wrote, before leaving that position. Another official replaced him, he said. The administration has decreased staffing at the NSC, something Morrison said was needed after “bloat” under the previous administration.
We didn’t get a statement from the White House when we asked about the NSC issue, but the Washington Post Fact Checker did. NSC spokesman John Ullyot told the Post: “No director-level positions were eliminated during this process, and the organization retained its subject matter expertise under a different organizational structure.”
Some have said the NSC needs a separate global health security point person or team — as the Center for Strategic & International Studies recommended. That’s a matter of opinion, and we take no position on that.
Three days before Morrison’s op-ed, Beth Cameron, former senior director for the old NSC team — the global health security and biodefense office — wrote in the Post that disbanding that directorate “left an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.”
Democratic senators had questioned the move at the time, as well as former government officials.
Kenneth W. Bernard, who served in both former President Bill Clinton’s and President George W. Bush’s administrations, wrote in 2018 that this was the third time that an administration had “downgraded the importance of disease and bioterrorism threats in the hierarchy of national security issues.” Bernard said he worked in such a post in 1998 but the Bush administration abolished it in 2001, then reopened it a year later after 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks. He said Obama abolished it again after his election, but in his second term created the NSC office.
Bolton responded to the recent criticism on Twitter on March 14, saying: “Claims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation’s bio defense are false. Global health remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis.”
Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly and Republican Rep. Steve Chabot have introduced a bill that would require that the president create a global health security interagency council and “appoint an employee of the National Security Council, serving at the senior director level or higher, to serve as Chair for the Council.”
Connolly asked Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a March 11 hearing whether it was a “mistake” to “dismantle” the office in the NSC devoted to global health and security. Fauci responded: “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there.”
We take no position on whether it was a mistake or not to eliminate the global health security post or restructure the NSC team. But it’s wrong for Democrats to cite Trump’s remarks about “some of the people we cut” as proof that he “lied” about not knowing what happened to the NSC team.",Lori Robertson,2020-03-20 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"The President was specifically asked about his proposed budgets, not any personnel reorganization or actions.”
Parkinson also said the claim that the NSC team was eliminated is “false,” saying, “former and current National Security Council officials have repeatedly said the team working on biodefense is still at the NSC.”
Others on Twitter, including celebrities and journalists, have retweeted a March 17 article by the Independent, a U.K. publication, that also linked Trump’s Feb. 26 remarks to the NSC issue. In a March 13 press conference, the president was asked “what responsibility do you take” for the “disband[ing ” of the White House pandemic office, and he responded that he “didn’t know anything about it.”
“And when you say ‘me,’ I didn’t do it,” the president said. Morrison objected to claims that the office was “dissolved,” writing in the Post on March 16 that the administration “create[d  the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. You know, people let people go.”
The next day, March 14, the Democratic National Committee tweeted: “Yesterday, Trump said he didn’t disband the government’s pandemic response team. After President Donald Trump said, “I don’t know anything about” the disbanding of a White House pandemic response office, the Democrats claimed that he “lied” and pointed to Trump’s earlier remarks about “some of the people we cut” as evidence."

Unverified reports of adverse events that occur following receipt of a vaccine have been a key source of misinformation for months. As we’ve repeatedly documented, anyone can submit a report to the U.S. system and the reports alone are not proof of a link to a vaccine.
In the latest iteration of that type of data being misrepresented, a peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal used it to dubiously claim that the COVID-19 vaccines were causing deaths at such a scale that they nearly rival the number of lives saved through the vaccines.
“For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination,” the paper, published on June 24 in Vaccines, claimed.

Days after the analysis was published — amid backlash from scientists, some of whom resigned from editorial roles with the publication — the journal issued a June 28 statement noting that there were “significant concerns” with the paper and that its assertion that the deaths were linked to vaccination “is incorrect and distorted.”
“The data has been misused because it makes the (incorrect) assumption that all deaths occurring post vaccination are caused by vaccination,” Katie Ewer, an immunologist at the University of Oxford, told Science in an email. “[And] it is now being used by anti-vaxxers and COVID-19-deniers as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe. [This] is grossly irresponsible, particularly for a journal specialising in vaccines.”
Vaccines, based in Switzerland, formally retracted the paper on July 2.
But in the days between its publication and retraction, the paper and its claims found a significant audience on social media, where they were spread widely across platforms.
The link to the paper was shared nearly 9,000 times on Facebook as of early July 2, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. Metrics on the journal’s site indicate it was viewed more than 367,000 times.
Liz Wheeler, a conservative commentator, promoted the paper in a June 30 video on Facebook — viewed more than 250,000 times — titled, “The Vaccine Study You’re Not Allowed To See.”
“This is a peer-reviewed, scientific study,” Wheeler tells her viewers. “Essentially, this peer-reviewed scientific study shows that COVID-19 vaccine causes two deaths for every three lives it saves.” 
Behind her in parts of the video is a board repeating the study’s claim as a statement of fact: “COVID vax kills two people for every three saved.”
As we said, the journal had acknowledged two days earlier that the data about purported deaths from the vaccines had been “distorted.”
The paper said that the authors used “the data of the Dutch national register … to gauge the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations.”
But the Dutch reporting system — maintained by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, called Lareb — includes a prominent disclaimer explicitly stating that a reported side effect may not be from the vaccine, similar to the adverse event reporting system used in the U.S., which we’ve explained.
Dr. Eugène van Puijenbroek, head of science and research at Lareb, told us in an email that the data used in the analysis “were interpreted incorrectly and therefore led to erroneous conclusions.” He said he had requested that the journal “make either an appropriate correction” or retract the study.
The system is used to “highlight possible safety signals at an early stage,” he said. “A reported event that occurred after vaccination is therefore not necessarily being caused by the vaccination, although our data was presented as being causally related by the authors. It should be noted that also the database of the European Medicines Agency that is mentioned in this article contains the same type of reports.”
“As clearly stated on our website, but not taken [into] account in the method applied in this article, death after vaccination does not imply that the adverse event is indeed the actual cause of death,” he said. “Existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases. In a limited number of reports, adverse events following immunisation, known to be associated with the COVID vaccines (e.g. fever, nausea or malaise), may have contributed to the worsening of an already fragile health condition or an underlying medical condition. Suggesting all reports with a fatal outcome to be causally related is far from truth.”
Also, Van Puijenbroek said, the paper’s assertion that the reported deaths “were certified by medical specialists” is “simply incorrect.”
The lead author of the study, Harald Walach, is a psychologist and professor at Poznan University of the Medical Sciences in Poland. He and his co-authors penned a two-page letter defending their study, published by Retraction Watch, in which they admitted “that these data are far from perfect” but said they were justified in using the data for analysis because “they are the only ones that are available.”
They also claimed that “[c]urrently we only have association, we agree, and we never said anything else.”
There were other issues with the paper, too.
In addition to the fact that the deaths and other adverse events reported to the Dutch system are not confirmed to be caused by the vaccines, the authors arbitrarily chose to use that system to look at the case reports submitted per 100,000 vaccinations. But that system’s volume is an outlier, relative to the rest of Europe.
“They have a median of 127 per 100k, ranging from 15 to 701, with Netherlands’ 701 being an extreme outlier,” Jeffrey Morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email. “They give some unconvincing rationale why they think using the 701 to represent the truth is the best idea, thus strongly skewing the adverse event rate of vaccines by a factor of almost 6 relative to using the median for all of Europe.”

The paper also uses a concept known as the number needed to vaccinate, or NNTV, to estimate how many doses would need to be administered in order to avert one COVID-19 case or death. For deaths, it concludes that “the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.”
But using that kind of measure — also referred to as the number needed to treat, or NNT — is problematic for several reasons, Morris said, especially for something where the risk is spread over a long period of time.
“The key factor here is that NNT depends directly on the time frame, and when you compute it using data from a short term study, it severely [underestimates] the benefit when the risk is spread over a longer time frame,” he said.
The authors used data from an Israeli study that followed up with participants who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for an average of 15 days.
Morris said the short time frame for computing vaccine benefit is “especially misleading” since the reported adverse events (which again, aren’t confirmed to be due to the vaccine) are typically occurring within that short time frame — “but only a small fraction of the beneficial effects of the vaccine, preventing cases for the next year or two or longer, are captured.”
Also, the measure is influenced by other factors — such as lockdowns, social distancing and masking.
And when many people are vaccinated, the probability of infection and death goes down — therefore making the number needed to vaccinate higher (and the vaccine benefit appear smaller).
“In short, the NNT is an extremely flawed measure even if they had good data for estimating the risk of infection, hospitalization and death for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and interpreted the data properly (which of course they did not),” Morris said.",Angelo Fichera,2021-07-02 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"He and his co-authors penned a two-page letter defending their study, published by Retraction Watch, in which they admitted “that these data are far from perfect” but said they were justified in using the data for analysis because “they are the only ones that are available.”

191,Stimulus Checks Won’t Reduce Future Tax Refunds,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/stimulus-checks-wont-reduce-future-tax-refunds/,,"Quick Take
Social media posts falsely claim that federal payments from the COVID-19 stimulus package could reduce taxpayers’ future refunds. The Internal Revenue Service says the payment “will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.”

Full Story
The IRS has begun dispersing money from the $2 trillion COVID-19 economic stimulus package. But memes and videos on social media are spreading misleading messages about made-up consequences for those who receive the payments.
A common claim in these posts is that payouts from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — which provides $1,200 lump-sum payments to most individuals making less than $75,000 a year — will either reduce future tax refunds or will have to be paid back.
One viral video originally posted on TikTok has been taken down from that site, but continues to circulate on Facebook, making the claim: “See, what they don’t tell you is that this is just an advance on your next tax return… Next year, you’re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season.”
That’s not true.
The claim in the video appears to stem from a misunderstanding of the language in the law, which uses a tax credit as the vehicle to get stimulus payments to individuals.
In a March report exploring options to stimulate the economy as it faltered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Congressional Research Service said: “One mechanism to provide cash payments relatively quickly is to create a new refundable tax credit and then advance it to households before they would otherwise claim it on their income tax returns.”
Later that month, when the CARES Act became law, that’s exactly what it did.
The CARES Act created a new tax credit for taxes that will be due on income earned in 2020, but it’s available to eligible individuals now. The credit allows for payments of $1,200 to most individuals earning less than $75,000, as we said, and a reduced amount (on a sliding scale) to individuals who make up to $99,000. Couples who are married and file joint taxes can get $2,400 if their combined income is under $150,000, and parents can collect $500 per child.
Like the familiar Earned Income Tax Credit or the Child Tax Credit, this tax credit does not need to be repaid.
The Treasury Department confirmed that to us in an email, and the IRS website explains, “the Payment is not income and you will not owe tax on your Payment. It will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return next year.”
Similarly, taxpayers receiving a stimulus payment based on a previous year’s income level would not have to pay anything back if their earnings in 2020 exceed the program’s income limits, according to the IRS.
Still, confusion persists online. In an example of just how pervasive the misunderstanding is, a copy of a chart showing an accurate description of the law’s allowances has been marked up and shared with misleading captions.
One such post highlighted the section of the chart that said: “This is an advance on a new tax credit on your 2020 taxes. So if you get your stimulus check, you will not get that credit when filing for 2020 taxes.” That part is correct — if a taxpayer collects the stimulus payment now, he can’t collect it again when he pays his 2020 taxes. But the marked up chart was shared with this caption: “They gave you YOUR MONEY back in exchange for your money next year.” That’s not true.
The individual who originally posted the chart, Fabian Saldivar of FS Tax Service Inc. — after seeing how social media users were responding — made it clear in his caption that the stimulus money is available through a new credit and it will not have to be repaid. In a phone interview with FactCheck.org he said, “they think it will get taken out of next year’s taxes, which is not true.”
Update, April 20: To address reader questions, we added that taxpayers who receive stimulus payments based on a previous year’s income would not have to pay anything back if their 2020 earnings exceed the program’s income limits.

192,Pennsylvania Voters Told to Quarantine Can Still Cast a Ballot,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/pennsylvania-voters-told-to-quarantine-can-still-cast-a-ballot/,,"Quick Take
Pennsylvania voters told to quarantine due to potential COVID-19 exposure are entitled to vote and can request and return an emergency absentee ballot through 8 p.m. on Election Day. A viral Facebook post misleadingly suggests they are being disenfranchised.

Full Story
A viral claim pushed on Facebook the day before the 2020 election misleadingly suggests that voters in Pennsylvania are being prevented from voting by the state Department of Health and threatened with arrest if they do.
Spread by a popular conservative radio host in western Pennsylvania, the Facebook post asserts that “[a]fter a reported ‘uptick’ in Covid positive cases, thousands of Pennsylvania voters in York, Lebanon, and Dauphin counties have been receiving letters from the state health department demanding that they quarantine for 14 days.”
“The letter states that they’ve been exposed to Covid-19 (no proof given) and, as such, must remain quarantined and not vote in person on election day,” the post continues. “If they fail to obey the order, they face possible arrest.”
It asks whether Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s “administration is attempting to silence voters — hours before the most important election in American history?”
The post is misleading for a few reasons:

The letters are not a new form of communication in response to recently rising COVID-19 cases in the state; the state has been using the letters for months — and not only in those counties. The letters make no mention of the election.
If someone in the state had planned to vote in person and is now under quarantine, they can still request and return an emergency absentee ballot until 8 p.m. on Election Day. That option is included on the state’s website regarding voting.
A state Department of Health spokeswoman said those who receive such letters are first contacted by case managers (if they’ve tested positive) or contact tracers (if they’ve been in contact with someone who is positive), who were instructed to provide information about voting options.
State health officials do not provide the names of those ordered to quarantine to state or local election officials, so no one would be stopped from casting a ballot in person.

Radio host Wendy Bell, who published the claim on Facebook, attributed the information in a subsequent live-stream video to a writer named Todd Bartley, whose story on a website called talkwilliamsport.com told of a “possible DOH voter suppression effort in Pennsylvania.”
That story focused on the purported script used by contact tracers in the state and included a copy of the state’s quarantine letter instructing individuals who had close contact with someone with COVID-19 to quarantine. It makes no mention of the election or voting, as we said.
While the story suggests the letter included was “obtained” and revelatory, the same exact copy — dated July and featuring the same redactions and highlighted section — was published by another reporter in August.
The letter instructs those who have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days. Near the end of the letter, the state Department of Health says: “If you do not cooperate with this directive, the Secretary of Health may petition a court to have you confined to an appropriate place chosen by the Department to make certain that you are not able to infect the public, and to make certain that you receive proper care.”
It continues by saying that “[l]aw enforcement may be called upon, to the extent necessary, to ensure your compliance with this directive.”
April Hutcheson, a health department spokeswoman, told us in a phone interview that the “quarantine letters have not changed since we started issuing them” at the start of the pandemic and “states what our authority is under the law.” They don’t make any references to voting or the election.
“We have not used that authority since the start of the pandemic,” she said. “There has been no one prosecuted in Pennsylvania [for violating quarantine]. If you’ve been contacted and been asked to quarantine, folks do the right thing and quarantine.”
Moreover, she said, no one receives the quarantine letter without first being contacted by a case manager or contact tracers, who were instructed to advise positive COVID-19 patients and close contacts on their voting options — including the option to contact their county elections officials to apply for an emergency absentee ballot, she said.
The website of the Department of State, which oversees the election process, says: “In emergency situations (such as an unexpected illness or disability and last-minute absence) … you can request an Emergency Absentee Ballot.” The ballot needs to be returned by 8 p.m. on Election Day.
State officials also outlined this option for quarantined individuals in an Oct. 28 Erie News Now report, and in a Nov. 2 press release.
“Every Pennsylvanian who is registered to vote will have the opportunity to do so,” Pennsylvania’s Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said in the press release, which was published following the viral claim’s spread. “There’s an emergency ballot provision under the law. If you can’t deliver your own balloting materials you can assign a designee to do that for you. And if you can’t find a designee, the law actually requires the county election office to have a Sheriff’s Deputy or some county official to deliver the balloting materials for the voter.”
Hutcheson also said the state would not prevent voters from casting a ballot in person — or arrest them, for that matter — if they showed up to do so despite quarantine directives. Health officials do not provide state and local elections officials with records that would enable them to identify people directed to quarantine, she said.
“If you were to show up at a polling place, no one would be able to stop you,” she said. “It is your right to go vote, but we would prefer if you tested positive … that you would get an absentee ballot.”
She likened voting to other essential tasks, such as leaving home to get groceries.
The state has reported more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases and nearly 9,000 deaths during the pandemic.

193,Gowdy Didn’t Author Viral Conspiracy Theory,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/gowdy-didnt-author-viral-conspiracy-theory/,,"Quick Take
A viral Facebook post, spreading a political conspiracy theory about COVID-19, is wrongly attributed to former Rep. Trey Gowdy. Gowdy confirmed to us that he did not write the post in question.


Full Story 
Former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina has publicly weighed in on some issues concerning the novel coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. politics surrounding it.
But the former Republican congressman did not write a more than 400-word conspiracy theory circulating on Facebook that implies, without any proof, that the outbreak was planned to help Democrats in the 2020 election.
“From Trey Gowdy,” the post begins. “I’m not saying Covid-19 isn’t real… But Pay attention folks, there’s much more going on here than what meets the eye.” 
It goes on to claim, among other things, that “there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment” and that “[i]t all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election.”
It’s unclear why or when Gowdy, a high-profile congressman who served from 2011 until Jan. 3, 2019, became tied to the viral text post. We found the same text repeatedly posted to Facebook as early as March 12 with no such attribution.
As the posts using his name (and image, in some cases) swirled in late April, Gowdy dismissed the attribution on his verified Facebook account.
“Just want to alert folks there is a fraudulent post attributed to me circulating on social media,” he wrote in an April 22 post. “Not the first time, likely not the last. We have enough going on in our country right now without propagating misinformation. Stay safe and strong.”
In an email to FactCheck.org, Gowdy confirmed that his statement was referring to the viral COVID-19 post.
Some versions of the post tying the text to Gowdy were updated in light of his Facebook statement.
One such post appeared on the Facebook page of Beatrice Cardenas, a Republican congressional candidate in California, and used the Gowdy attribution and an image of the former congressman. It remains up and has been shared 48,000 times, but an update was added at the bottom reading: “4/22 EDIT: several people have sent me a message posted by Trey Gowdy making a disclaimer about posts attributed to him he did not write. We are unsure who was the original author.”
Still, multiple versions of the post leave the false attribution in place — and new ones are still being published.
And other iterations have used different attributions altogether. Another post of the same text was credited to former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, even though there’s no evidence it was his work, either. One simply sourced it to an unnamed “Trump Supporter.”
This is just the latest example of a viral post leveraging a name to advance an argument.

194,"COVID-19 Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein is Safe, Contrary to Viral Claims",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-covid-19-vaccine-generated-spike-protein-is-safe-contrary-to-viral-claims/,,"All of the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States are designed to instruct human cells to make harmless spike proteins — mimicking a viral protein that’s used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter cells. When the immune system recognizes the proteins, which aren’t normally there, it starts generating antibodies and building an immune response against them. The process prepares the body against future infection. 
These vaccines have been found to be effective and safe in clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants, and in real world conditions with over 325 million doses administered. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the “most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history” has found that most of the reported side effects after COVID-19 vaccination are minor, such as pain at the injection site or fever. Severe adverse reactions to the vaccines have been rare. 
Yet, a Canadian virus immunologist recently claimed that the vaccine’s spike protein is “a pathogenic protein,” “a toxin” that gets into the bloodstream, then accumulates in breast milk and “in a number of tissues” and could lead to cardiovascular and neurological damage in adults, children and infants. 
“We made a big mistake,” said Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at the University of Guelph’s Ontario Veterinary College, during an interview with Canadian radio personality Alex Pierson on May 27. “We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.”
According to his profile, Bridle’s research focuses on biotherapies for the treatment of cancers and the way organisms respond to viruses. Since the pandemic started, his lab has been trying to develop vaccines against coronaviruses, for which he received a $230,000 grant from the Ontario government. 
Bridle’s interview was reposted by several publications, including one owned by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization. Segments of the interview were widely spread in social media platforms in English and Spanish. 
But researchers and health officials told FactCheck.org there is no “mistake” and that there is no evidence to support Bridle’s claims. 
There is no evidence that the spike protein in vaccines “is toxic or that it lingers at any toxic level in the body after vaccination,” an FDA spokesperson told us in an email.
Jason McLellan, a structural biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who has been studying spike proteins in other coronaviruses for years and whose work was fundamental for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, said Bridle’s statements are not correct.  
“The spike protein is not pathogenic. It is not a toxin,” McLellan told us in an email. “I have not seen any data to support what Bridle claims.”
No Evidence Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein Lingers in Bloodstream
Bridle, who in the radio show said he’s “very much pro-vaccine,” says his claims are “completely backed up by peer-reviewed scientific publications in well-known and well-respected scientific journals.” 
But authors of two of the studies he cites told us their findings don’t back Bridle’s statements. 
“Bridle is taking our results and completely misinterpreting them,” said David R. Walt, a member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School and of Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, who co-authored a study that found circulating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen in the plasma of vaccine recipients. 
The study, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in May, collected plasma from 13 health care workers at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine. Researchers detected levels of SARS-CoV-2 protein as early as one day after the first injection in 11 of the 13 participants.
Bridle presents the study as evidence that the spike protein gets into blood circulation. 
Walt told us in an email that the aim of the study was to see if an ultrasensitive detection technology, a single-molecule array, could detect circulating antigen produced by the mRNA vaccine to demonstrate the vaccine is working as designed. 
“We found we could detect extremely low concentrations of S1 (a subunit of spike) in 11 of 13 healthy vaccinated individuals and the full spike in 3 of 13,” he said in an email, noting that the technology they used is 1,000 times more sensitive than a typical antigen test, “so we are really detecting minute quantities of the spike and S1 proteins.” (Emphasis is his). 
“We found that within a few days of the antigen appearing, the individuals developed antibodies that removed the antigen from the bloodstream,” he added. “Our conclusion was that the vaccine is working as intended.”  
Walt, a pathology professor, added there is no evidence that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein that causes damage in several tissues. 
“COVID, on the other hand, is known to have significant effects on many tissues and organs,” he said. “The most important message is that over 400 million doses of the mRNA vaccine have been administered with negligible serious consequences. It is incredibly safe.”
A second study Bridle uses to support his claims is one by Pfizer. In the radio interview with Pierson, Bridle says he and “other international collaborators” obtained the document through a request for information to a Japanese regulatory agency, claiming that it shows for the “first time ever” where the mRNA vaccines “go after vaccination.”
“Is it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is absolutely not,” Bridle says in the radio show. “The spike protein gets into the blood, circulates through the blood in individuals over several days post vaccination, it accumulates … in a number of tissues such as the spleen, the bone marrow, the liver, the adrenal glands …  and in quite high concentrations, in the ovaries,” he said.   
Keanna Ghazvini, a Pfizer spokesperson, told us in an email that the document referred to by Bridle, which is mostly in Japanese, is a pharmacokinetics overview of the company’s vaccine. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how a drug moves through the body, including how quickly drugs are absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. The document was “part of the submission data applied by Pfizer to PMDA (Japan’s version of FDA) for its review,” and it is publicly available online, Ghazvini said.  
“The document is about the pharmacokinetics overview seen from lab studies and we can confirm it’s not about spike proteins from the vaccine resulting in dangerous toxins that linger in the body,” Ghazvini said. 
According to a statement sent to FactCheck.org by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the vaccine-generated spike protein “is not secreted into circulation in the bloodstream.” 
Virus Spike Protein vs. Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein 
The spike proteins from the virus and the ones generated by the vaccines are “essentially the same,” McLellan, the spike protein researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, told us, noting that they have the same function, structure and way of processing.
But, he said, there is “one key difference,” in that the spikes encoded by the vaccines “contain 2 amino acid changes that help stabilize the spike in its initial conformation and help prevent the spike from undergoing a conformational change that is required to facilitate membrane fusion.”
That’s because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a shape-shifter. To fuse its viral membrane with the host cell membrane it substantially changes its shape from an unstable pre-fusion state to a stable post-fusion state. While previously working on a vaccine for MERS, a disease caused by another coronavirus, McLellan and others discovered that by adding two proline molecules to the spike protein, they could lock it into its pre-fusion state, triggering a more effective immune response and preventing cell entry. The same harmless mutation, called 2P, as in two proline molecules, is used in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. 
During a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the NIAID told us, the virus spike proteins can latch onto human cells, allowing the virus to infect them. With the live virus, the protein “attaches to receptors on the surface of cells and fuses the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane,” McLellan said. 
However, vaccine-generated spike proteins can’t do that fusion because they are locked in the pre-fusion shape.
“The spike protein encoded by the mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech) and the J&J vaccine instruct the cells in our arm (where the injection is given) to produce spike protein that is tethered to the surface of the cell. It is not secreted and thus does not float through the body,” McLellan said. 
According to the NIAID statement, “the spike protein is only detectable for a few days after immunization” in tests conducted in animals. 
No Evidence Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein Is Harmful
FactCheck.org reached out to Bridle for comment. In response we got an automatic email reply saying he “cannot respond” because “his workload has become challenging to manage” after the radio interview, which led to “vicious attacks by some.” 
In two documents prepared in response to the attention brought by the interview, Bridle says the Canadian government “should be called upon to immediately halt the mass vaccination program of children and adolescents.” He says “there is no immediate threat of severe COVID-19 in the majority of Canadian children and adolescents,” and that more safety and efficacy data is needed for the “use of experimental vaccines.”
In May, Canada authorized the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 12 to 15, following authorization of the vaccine in youth 16 years old and older in December. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends offering the vaccine “to all children and adolescents 12 years of age and older as soon as vaccine supply permits.”
In a document published in June, Bridle says severe SARS-CoV-2 infections “can cause damage to the cardiovascular system” and “neurological problems.” 
“[T]he spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 might be responsible for at least some of the damage that occurs in severe cases of COVID-19,” he says, citing a study published in March in Circulation Research. 
The study, in which researchers administered a pseudovirus to hamsters, found the spike protein “alone can damage vascular endothelial cells.” But as the authors mention, the use of a pseudovirus is a limitation and “findings need to be confirmed with the SARS-CoV-2 virus” in the future. 
Furthermore, the study concludes that vaccines not only protect people from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also from damage to the endothelium, a thin membrane that lines the inside of the heart and blood vessels.
According to a statement sent to FactCheck.org by NIAID, if “enough excess spike proteins are shed into the bloodstream and bind to human cells expressing the ACE2 receptor, an infected person could theoretically experience additional symptoms. However, this is theoretical; the exact mechanism by which COVID-19 infection leads to cardiovascular symptoms is still unclear.” 
Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher and professor of microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, says there is “not much virus in the blood following infection with SARS2.” 
“I am quite confident that the spike protein is not a toxin,” she told FactCheck.org in an email. “Furthermore if vaccine induced spike were pathogenic wouldn’t we see a lot of illness following vaccination?” 
Study on Vaccine Transfer into Breast Milk Distorted
Finally, Bridle says there is evidence that the mRNA vaccines get transferred through breast milk, citing a preprint from Singapore that tested milk samples from 10 lactating health care workers after they were immunized with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The unpublished study found antibodies in the breast milk from all of the workers and “minimal amounts of vaccine mRNA.”
“36 out of 40 (90%) samples did not show detectable levels of vaccine mRNA. The highest concentration of BNT162b2 mRNA in the tested samples was 2 ng/mL … a hypothetical 0.667% of the original vaccine dose being transferred in 100 mL of human milk,” the study says. “This miniscule amount of mRNA is expected to be readily destroyed by enzymes in the infant’s gut,” the authors say in the discussion. 
The study concluded “lactating individuals should continue breastfeeding” after being vaccinated.
Bridle omits this information in his 37-page document, instead saying that detection of the mRNA “was downplayed.”   
“Now we know the spike protein gets into circulation. Any protein in the blood will get concentrated in breast milk,” he said on the radio show. “Looking into the adverse event database in the United States, we have found evidence of suckling infants experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract.”
As we’ve reported, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is designed to detect potential problems — that’s why it’s there — but it does not show whether the vaccines caused any of the reported issues. Anyone can submit a report of an event to VAERS, even if it’s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem, and all of the notifications are accepted without determining if the event was caused by a vaccine. 
“It is unlikely that enough of the spike protein could accumulate in breast milk to have any impact on infants that consume it,” NIAID told us in a statement.  
Dr. Jeannie Kelly, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and lead author of a study on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk following vaccination, told us there is no evidence to support Bridle’s claims.
“We did not measure spike protein levels in our study. However, there is no evidence that the spike protein is in breast milk,” Kelly said in an email. “Much like any other vaccination in a breast feeding person, even if the spike protein makes it into the milk, the protein would be degraded by the stomach acid. Even if the spike protein was absorbed into the blood stream, it has no mechanism of action to cause any issues such as bleeding disorders.”
According to the CDC’s website there is limited data available on the safety and the effects of vaccination in lactating people or breastfed babies because the clinical trials didn’t include people who were breastfeeding. However, it says, based on available data “COVID-19 vaccines are thought not to be a risk.”
In fact, recent studies show breastfeeding after vaccinations may provide babies with protection. 
Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the World Health Organization encourage women who are breastfeeding to take the vaccine. 
“There is no risk at all because all the vaccines that are being used presently, none of them have the live virus in it. And so there’s no risk of transmission through the breast milk. In fact, the antibodies that the mother has can go through the breast milk to the baby and may only serve maybe to protect the baby a little bit. But there’s absolutely no harm. It’s very safe,” says WHO’s Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan on a podcast produced by the organization.",Catalina Jaramillo,2021-07-01 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"According to a statement sent to FactCheck.org by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the vaccine-generated spike protein “is not secreted into circulation in the bloodstream.”

195,Viral Posts Misuse VAERS Data to Make False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-viral-posts-misuse-vaers-data-to-make-false-claims-about-covid-19-vaccines/,,"
Update, Aug. 26: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.
Millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. 
Over 145 million doses had been administered as of March 30, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and over 95 million people had received at least one dose of the vaccine. 
Most of those who have reported side effects have said they were minor, such as pain or swelling at the injection site, headaches, chills or fever — which are all consistent with the results of clinical trials. Some people have no side effects at all. And a small number of people (2 to 5 people per million vaccinated) have reported a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which “almost always” happens within a half an hour of being vaccinated, the CDC says. 
Yet over and over websites and social media posts improperly cite unverified raw data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an alert system managed by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to detect possible safety issues in vaccines, as evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths and serious events. 
Take this Instagram video, seen by over 36,000 users. In the video, a female narrator walks viewers through the VAERS website and shows them how to find adverse reactions reported to the database after people received the COVID-19 vaccines. 
“Acute myocardial infarction. That is a stroke, if you guys aren’t aware of what that means,” she says incorrectly at the 2:30 mark, as she scrolls down through the results. A myocardial infarction is a heart attack. 
And a couple of minutes later: “Death. And here we are y’all —  this is exactly what you guys wanted to see. Death. Patient passed away in her sleep. Look at all these deaths you guys,” the narrator says scrolling down through dozens of death reports. 
“Do your own research,” writes the account owner on the post, a man under the name “Truth Bombs,” who in a second similar post says he’s not a scientist or a doctor but a concerned father, patriot and digital soldier. “There are very serious side effect from getting the vaccines. Here’s your PROOF.”
Except, as the VAERS website warns, any report submitted to the database “is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.” 
As we’ve explained before, anyone can submit a report of an event to VAERS, even if it’s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem. All reports are accepted into the database without determining whether the event was caused by a particular vaccine, and therefore, as a disclaimer warns, submissions “may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.” 
“One of the main limitations of VAERS data is that it cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event,” reads its website. “This limitation has caused confusion in the publicly available data from VAERS WONDER, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. There have been instances where people have misinterpreted reports of deaths following vaccination as deaths caused by the vaccines; that is not accurate.”
So when VAERS says it has received 2,509 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine as of March 29, that does not mean that those deaths were caused by the vaccine. 
In fact, after reviewing medical records, autopsies and death certificates for all of those cases, physicians from both the CDC and the FDA determined that there was “no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.”
What Is VAERS? 
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is a national early warning system to detect possible safety issues in vaccines established by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1990. 
The main goal of the database is to serve as a signaling system for adverse reactions, or events, that were not detected during the clinical trials or before a vaccine entered the market. It also complies with a National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requirement for vaccine manufacturers to report all adverse events and health care providers to report specific adverse events following the administration of a vaccine.

VAERS accepts all reports of suspected adverse events, in all age groups. Patients, parents and caregivers are encouraged to report “any clinically important medical event or health problem that occurs after vaccination,” even if they’re not sure if it was a result of the vaccine. These reactions may or may not been caused by a vaccine. 
These reports create a public national database that allows government scientists, and others, to rapidly detect unusual and unexpected patterns that later can be analyzed. 
“It generates perhaps the most rapid type of signal if there was something really awful going on,” Dr. Susan S. Ellenberg, a professor of biostatistics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, told us. 
As described on its website, VAERS can detect new, unusual or rare reactions to vaccines; monitor increases in known side effects; assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines; and identify other possible safety issues. 
Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta, who directed the CDC’s immunization program from 1988 to 2004, told us that VAERS’ unique capacity of generating timely signals makes it an extremely important tool. 
“It is the best signal generator,” he said. “We may miss signals without VAERS.”
Orenstein said VAERS was very helpful in 1998, for example, when it detected a safety issue with the first rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, as it was being associated with a type of bowel obstruction in infants called intussusception. After the cases were reviewed, the CDC withdrew its recommendation for that vaccine, and the manufacturer took it off the market.  
More recently, as explained in a 2015 study co-authored by scientists from the CDC and FDA, VAERS detected unusual reporting for febrile seizures in young children following a flu shot during the 2010-2011 season. After those episodes, the CDC started listing febrile seizures as a possible side effect of some vaccines for infants and children up to 5 years old.
VAERS Causation Limitation
Although VAERS is great at creating alerts for researchers to follow up, experts agree the database has multiple weaknesses. 
“The biggest limitation is it usually cannot help us assess causation, it provides signals,” Orenstein said. 
As we said, everyone is encouraged to report any medical event or health problem, even if they’re not sure it was caused by a vaccine. The event may have been caused by an underlying medical condition, by a medication or drug taken at the same time, or simply by chance. 
When VAERS detects something unusual, those signals are investigated by scientists and other vaccine surveillance systems, such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration between the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine health care organizations, or the CDC’s Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, a network of vaccine safety experts, including those at seven medical research centers, to evaluate causality. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, VAERS is just one of several vaccine safety monitoring systems the government has in place. 
According to a November 2020 VAERS report, less than 15% of all the events reported to the database describe “serious events, such as hospitalizations, life-threatening illnesses, or deaths.” When a death is reported, the agency collects information, including medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates, and a qualified physician determines the cause of death.
“Just because somebody reports death doesn’t mean that the vaccine caused the death. So we don’t use VAERS to determine death rates or anything concerning death,” a CDC spokesperson told us previously. 
The vast majority of events reported for COVID-19 vaccines haven’t been serious. 
In the latest safety update presented by the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Team to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on March 1, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro reported that as of Feb. 16, 94% of the reports submitted to VAERS after the administration of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were for non-serious events such as headaches, fever, chills and fatigue. The reports of serious events, such as anaphylaxis, heart attacks and strokes, were assessed by vaccine surveillance systems. Except for cases of anaphylaxis, which were rare, the CDC reported no safety concerns were detected, meaning there was no cause and effect relationship between the vaccines and the reported adverse events.  
“People die, unfortunately, without vaccination,” Orenstein told us. “The issue is to determine where the vaccine enhances that risk of death and not, and that’s why we have this very careful system.”
He said the fact that VAERS doesn’t determine causation is difficult for people to understand, despite all the disclaimers on its website and brochures. 
“There is a natural human tendency — plus it has served us well — if event B follows event A, then event A caused event B. I mean, we don’t need a scientific study to know if you jump out of a plane without a parachute, you’re going to be in trouble,” Orenstein said. “I think the issue here is the clinical syndromes that are occurring and [are being] reported to VAERS can also occur without a vaccine. And that’s what complicates things.”
Other VAERS Limitations
The fact that VAERS cannot assess causality is not its only weakness. 
“It’s the worst possible data that you could possibly imagine because there’s so many uncertainties about it,” said Ellenberg, who analyzed VAERS data for 11 years as director of the FDA’s Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
One of the major problems, she said, is that there’s no control group to study because unvaccinated people do not report adverse events to VAERS. Therefore, there’s no way to determine if the number of reported events is different from the number that would have been observed without vaccination. 
Take the 2,509 reports of death filed to VAERS as of March 29, which represent 0.0017% of those who had received a COVID-19 vaccine. People die every day for any number of reasons. In 2019, for example, 0.8% of the U.S. population died from any cause, according to the CDC. That was before the coronavirus pandemic. 
“You’re going to have deaths that had nothing to do with the vaccines,” Ellenberg told us. 
Deaths unrelated to COVID-19 occurred during the vaccine clinical trials, she said. So she expected to see deaths unrelated to the vaccines among the general population, especially considering that older people and people with underlying medical conditions are getting vaccinated first.
Another issue, Ellenberg said, is the accuracy and completeness of the data because anything that anybody reports goes into the database. A person could file a report omitting important details, such as which vaccine they got. Or someone could even report a false event, or report an event without having received a vaccine in the first place — although filing a false VAERS report intentionally is a violation of federal law punishable by fine and imprisonment.
“So you know, if somebody reports that they went skiing and broke their leg, and you know, two years before they had gotten a flu shot, they could report that to VAERS,” she said. 
As experts have told us before, reports to VAERS tend to increase when there’s more awareness of the vaccine or more publicity around specific side effects. For example, Ellenberg said, there was an increase in the number of VAERS reports following approval of a Lyme disease vaccine in the late 1990s and a class-action lawsuit against the vaccine manufacturer, which withdrew the vaccine from the market even though “the adverse event rate was not shown to be elevated among vaccine recipients,” according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
VAERS data aren’t meant to allow safety comparisons between vaccines, but multiple social media posts make such false comparisons anyway. As a disclaimer on the VAERS website states: “The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.”
Other limitations include underreporting, when people don’t report serious events happening after vaccines.
“In addition, it is often the case that more than one vaccine was administered, making it difficult to know to which of the vaccines the event might be attributed,” the VAERS user guide says.
Experts agree that even with all of VAERS’ weaknesses, having a system with the potential for identifying new adverse effects and signals that can be followed up with more data is still worth having. That’s especially true in cases when an emergency use authorization has been issued, and there has been less time to monitor possible adverse events before a vaccine gets on the market. 
Because of the urgency of the ongoing pandemic, the FDA required at least two months of follow-up data on half or more of the participants in phase 3 clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine to get an emergency use authorization. As we’ve explained, full licensure requires a minimum of six months, though experts say there’s little reason to think more time would uncover safety concerns.
“There are people who have said VAERS, and those kinds of systems are worthless, we shouldn’t even bother with them,” Ellenberg said. “I don’t agree with that.”
Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says “women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.” As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see “Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.”

196,Trump Wrong About Ventilators,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-wrong-about-ventilators/,,"President Donald Trump falsely claimed that his administration was not initially able to meet the increasing demand for ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients because “we weren’t left ventilators by a previous administration.”
We can’t say for sure how many ventilators there were in the Strategic National Stockpile when Trump took office, but there were likely thousands.
Update, June 25: In a June 20 statement to FactCheck.org, an HHS spokesperson said the SNS had 16,660 ventilators “immediately available for use” when the federal government began distributing them to states in March. The spokesperson also told us none of the 16,660 ventilators ready for use in March was “acquired” by the Trump administration, which began announcing federal contracts for new ventilators in April. For more, read our June 22 post “Trump Inherited More Ventilators Than Have Been Distributed.”
A 2017 article published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated there were roughly 9,000 ventilators in the federal stockpile as of at least 2010, and ventilators in the U.S. stockpile had never been distributed in the 20 years prior to the global coronavirus outbreak in 2020, according to Richard Branson, a respiratory care specialist and professor at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center who advises the federal government on ventilator supplies.
Reporters also described seeing some of the government’s stash of ventilators in 2016, when they toured at least one of the secret U.S. warehouses where the breathing machines and other equipment are stored in the event of a health crisis, such as a pandemic.
Trump repeatedly has made the general claim that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies was “empty” or “bare” when he took office. That’s false, as we have written before.
But he specifically said there weren’t any ventilators when answering reporters’ questions during a recent White House event about his administration’s efforts to protect seniors from contracting the novel coronavirus. Seniors are vulnerable to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, particularly those in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. 
Trump, April 30: We had a ventilator problem that was caused by the fact that we weren’t left ventilators by a previous administration. The cupboards were bare, as I say often.  And not only are the cupboards full now, we have ventilators; we’re the king in the world of ventilators. We have thousands and thousands of them now being delivered.
But it’s not true that the Trump administration did not inherit any ventilators. Reporters said they saw ventilators during a tour of one of the U.S. facilities housing the stockpile’s massive inventory.
“As we walk, I hear a loud hum. It’s a giant freezer packed with products that have to be kept cold,” wrote NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce in June 2016 — only months before Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.
“Just outside it, there are rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing. [Shirley] Mabry explains that they’re kept in a constant state of readiness. ‘If you look down to the side you’ll see there’s electrical outlets so they can be charged once a month,’ she says. Not only that—the ventilators get sent out for yearly maintenance.”
VICE News also reported seeing the machines when its film crew visited one of the facilities for an episode of “VICE News Tonight” that aired in December 2016.  
“[A]lthough we couldn’t reveal where it was or what exactly it had inside. It looked like a prepper’s Ikea, with row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment — including that one item everyone’s been talking about lately, ventilators,” Vice News said.
We can’t say exactly how many ventilators were in the stockpile when Trump was inaugurated; the federal government doesn’t usually publicize the specific numbers.
But, as of 2010, there were around 9,000, according to a 2017 article published in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. And in an April 7 article, the technology news website Recode quoted Branson, an adviser to the federal government, as saying, “This is the first time in 20 years ventilators from the stockpile have been used.”
In fact, a 2012 report from the Department of Health and Human Services said: “During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, ventilator shortages were not reported to HHS, and ventilators were not deployed from the SNS.” That’s the same pandemic that caused the SNS to distribute “12.5 million regimens of antiviral drugs, 19.6 million pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE), 85.1 million N95 respirators, and 2,129 doses of IV peramivir,” according to Greg Burel, the stockpile’s former director.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there were 12,700 ventilators in the stockpile, as of March 15. At the time, the CDC says there were about 9,500 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. Currently, there are nearly 1.1 million cases in the U.S. and more than 64,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.
Trump can argue that there initially weren’t enough ventilators to accommodate every state’s request, although the stockpile was never designed to be able to do that, Burel has said.
But it’s simply not the case that the federal government did not have any ventilators on hand when Trump took the reins from President Barack Obama more than three years ago.

197,Where the U.S. Ranks in COVID-19 Deaths Per Capita,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/where-the-u-s-ranks-in-covid-19-deaths-per-capita/,,"1The United States has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 deaths per capita in the world. However, President Donald Trump made the false claim that “Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people.”
As of May 11, the U.S. had 24.66 deaths per 100,000 people — more than two times higher than Germany (9.24 deaths per 100,000), and the 11th highest rate out of the more than 140 countries tracked by Johns Hopkins University.
Trump made his remarks about the per-capita death rates during a May 11 press briefing at the White House.
Trump, May 11: I think one of the things we’re most proud of is — this just came out — deaths per 100,000 people, death — so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning, low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that’s perhaps the most important number there is.
Of the more than 140 countries for which data is available, the U.S. figure for deaths per 100,000 people as of May 11 was the 11th highest and Germany’s was the 18th highest. Neither is anywhere near the “lowest rung of that ladder.”

Countries near the top diagonal line have the highest mortality per 100,000 people in the general population. Points with a black border represent the 10 most affected countries by COVID-19 worldwide, based on the number of deaths. (Data is as of May 11 at 11:46 p.m. EST.)
We asked the White House if the president’s claim was based on other data, but we have not received a response.
It’s possible Trump meant to refer to a different statistic on the Johns Hopkins University website: the observed case-fatality ratio (COVID-19 deaths divided by confirmed cases) among the 10 countries the university said have been “most affected” by the global coronavirus outbreak. By that limited measure, Germany (4.4%) had the lowest case-fatality ratio and the U.S. (6.0%) had the second lowest among the 10 countries.  
But that’s not what Trump said. 
Instead, the president gave the false impression that the U.S. — which has had more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and about 80,000 deaths — has one of the lowest per-capita death rates of any nation.

198,Pence’s False Claims About Trump’s Handling of Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/pences-false-claims-about-trumps-handling-of-coronavirus/,,"During a visit to Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence made several false claims about President Donald Trump’s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
In remarks to employees of Winnebago Industries in Forest City, Iowa, June 16, Pence said Trump “shut down all travel from China.” The president did impose travel restrictions on China but did not shut down all travel.
Pence also said that Trump took the action before there had been a single case of the disease in this country. That also is not accurate.
And finally, Pence said that Trump’s action gave the United States time to set up its response to the pandemic. But some disease experts say the Trump administration did not use that time effectively.
Pence, June 16:  You know, before we had a single coronavirus case in this country, this president shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response.
There have been more than 2.1 million cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the United States and more than 116,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The novel coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, late last year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the China travel restrictions on Jan. 31. The restrictions, which went into effect Feb. 2, prohibited non-U.S. citizens who had traveled to China within the previous two weeks from entering the U.S.
But the new rules didn’t apply to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members.
A New York Times story on April 4 found that nearly 40,000 people had flown on direct flights from China to the United States in the two months after the travel restrictions went into effect.  So travel from China had hardly been “shut down.”
Trump, too, has frequently overstated the extent of his travel restrictions. For example, as we have written, in April he three times incorrectly referred to a “travel ban” and on another occasion said he had “closed the border” with China.
Pence also was off-base in saying the travel restrictions were imposed before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the United States. In fact, the first reported case was confirmed 11 days earlier, on Jan. 20. The infected man, a resident of Snohomish County, Washington, in his 30s, developed symptoms after returning from a trip to the area around Wuhan.
There were four confirmed cases as of Jan. 31, when the travel restrictions were announced, and nine cases two days later, when they took effect, according to the CDC.
Trump has said accurately that no one had died in the U.S. when his administration announced the travel restrictions. The first reported coronavirus death in this country was disclosed on Feb. 29.
Pence said the travel restrictions “bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response.” But experts have faulted Trump for failing to use that time to act more aggressively in dealing with the pandemic. In fact, between Jan. 22 and March 10, Trump frequently minimized the impact of the coronavirus.
For example, Trump said on Feb. 26, “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”
And as late as March 10, the president said, “And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” The following day, the World Health Organization declared the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
Asked whether the restrictions had indeed “bought us invaluable time,” Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email: “I do think it bought us a bit of time, though it was not very well or effectively implemented. The White House was in denial for January and most of February, and then took a laissez-faire attitude for much of March, squandering that time.”
One of the keys to dealing with a pandemic is widespread testing. In an ad in May, the Trump campaign misleadingly boasted that the president had taken “fast action” in regard to testing. But several infectious disease experts also disputed that assertion.
“The United States has lagged nearly every developed country in ramping up testing, and the slow action is one reason why we have the worst epidemic in the world and are discussing reopening when it is not safe to do so, while other countries have used testing as a centerpiece of their strategy to reduce cases to a point where reopening is much more appropriate,” Lipsitch, told us for a previous story. “The lack of testing has been not only a public health catastrophe in the US, but also is a direct cause of our economic suffering.”
And Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in an email at the time: “We need only look at other countries (like South Korea, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand and others) to see what rapid testing and identification can do to slow down spread of this virus. South Korea had done 150,000 tests before we had done 500. The fact that we have more deaths per million in the population than many other developed countries is a testament to our slow response to this virus.”
Among the factors slowing down the testing were the CDC’s problems in producing tests and delays in enlisting hospital labs and commercial labs in developing tests, according to Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration. In April, we documented the extent and causes of the testing delays.

199,"Flawed Comparison on Coronavirus, H1N1 Emergency Timelines",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/flawed-comparison-on-coronavirus-h1n1-emergency-timelines/,,"Quick Take
Facebook posts falsely claim that it “took [President Barack] Obama ‘millions infected and over 1,000 deaths’ to declare the H1N1 flu a health emergency,” but President Donald Trump “declared a health emergency” before the first coronavirus death. In reality, both administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths.


Full Story 
We’ve previously dissected President Donald Trump’s faulty comparisons between his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and former President Barack Obama’s handling of the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic.
But misleading comparisons persist, and recent social media posts twist the facts about the timing of emergency declarations for the two outbreaks.

“[I]t took Obama ‘millions infected and over 1,000 deaths’ to declare the H1N1 flu a health emergency,” read a March 29 meme on the verified page of Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. But under Trump, “coronavirus was declared a health emergency and public safety measures were in place before a single U.S. death occurred.”
That’s wrong. Both the Obama and Trump administrations declared public health emergencies before the first reported deaths relating to the novel coronavirus and H1N1.
The meme actually compares the point at which Trump declared a public health emergency and the point at which Obama issued a national emergency — two distinct processes. A spokesman for Turning Point USA acknowledged in an email that its “social media team confused the two different types of emergency declarations.”
A public health emergency, declared by the secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, gives the federal government and states certain flexibilities, such as temporarily reassigning personnel, to respond to a major health issue. A national emergency declared by the president is more substantial and can provide access to significant sums of federal money and resources.
Turning Point USA deleted the image after our inquiry, but other posts of the same meme are still on Facebook, and the claim also migrated to Twitter (and back to Facebook).
Here’s an actual (albeit abridged) timeline for the emergency declarations for each pandemic.
Emergency Declarations for H1N1

The first U.S. infection of the novel type of influenza was identified in California on April 15, 2009.
On April 25, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern.
The next day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. (It was repeatedly renewed.)
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first fatality from the outbreak days later, on April 29.
WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic on June 11.
By Oct. 5, an H1N1 vaccine was ready and the first doses were given in the U.S.
Obama weeks later declared a national emergency on Oct. 24, 2009. The CDC director, Dr. Thomas Frieden, said at the time that millions of people had been infected in the U.S. and more than 1,000 had died.

Emergency Declarations for COVID-19

The CDC confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., in Washington state, on Jan. 21.
WHO declared a global public health emergency of international concern days later on Jan. 30.
The next day, on Jan. 31, HHS declared a public health emergency for the U.S. in response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease.
Weeks later, on Feb. 29, the first U.S. death attributed to the virus was reported.
WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
On March 13, Trump declared a national emergency. As of March 12, there had been 40 reported deaths in the U.S.

In addition to being wrong, the posts misleadingly suggest that while Trump took decisive action on the coronavirus outbreak and put “public safety measures” in place, Obama failed to do the same when it came to H1N1.
As we’ve previously explained, the CDC began releasing antiviral drugs to treat the H1N1 flu on April 26, the same day of Obama’s public health emergency declaration, and two days later the FDA approved a new CDC test for the disease. By April 30, Obama formally requested $1.5 billion from Congress to address the outbreak (the Obama administration later asked for nearly $9 billion). And a vaccine was made available in about six months.
More than 12,000 people are estimated to have died from H1N1 between April 2009 and April 2010, according to the CDC. There have been more than 3,400 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. as of early March 31.

200,Indiana Doctor Piles On Bogus COVID-19 Claims in Viral Video,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-indiana-doctor-piles-on-bogus-covid-19-claims-in-viral-video/,,"Full Story
Update, Aug. 23: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.
A cascade of false and misleading claims undercutting public health guidance about COVID-19 has been widely circulating on social media.
The video, viewed more than 4 million times on YouTube alone, features an Indiana doctor urging his school district to eschew guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On July 27, the CDC cited the highly contagious delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 when it recommended that everyone — students, teachers, staff and visitors — wear a mask inside schools, regardless of vaccination status. The CDC has also emphasized the importance of vaccination in getting students back to in-person classes.
“Vaccination is the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to the CDC’s guidance. “Promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning as well as extracurricular activities and sports.”
But, at an Aug. 6 meeting of the Mt. Vernon Board of School Trustees, Dr. Daniel Stock claimed that the CDC and other government health agencies “don’t bother to read science” before making their recommendations.
Stock, who runs a direct primary care practice that sells vitamins and supplements online, then launched into a roughly six-minute recitation of some popular but dubious claims about COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, in an effort to persuade the school board to forgo public health guidance. We’ll address some of his major points below, most of which we’ve debunked before.
The social media accounts that have shared the viral versions of this video are political, not medical or scientific. For example, Sebastian Gorka, a one-time aide to former President Donald Trump and host of a conservative podcast, shared the video with his 1 million followers on Twitter and posted a version that was viewed 1.8 million times on Instagram. FactCheck.org reached out to Stock for comment, but did not receive a reply. 
Misleading Claim on Face Masks
In addressing the use of face masks, one of the most common targets for COVID-19 misinformation, Stock told the board: “So, things you should know about coronavirus and all other respiratory viruses — they are spread by aerosol particles, which are small enough to go through every mask, by the way.” Stock cited studies contained on a flash drive given to the school board. It’s unclear what studies Stock is citing; he did not return our call for comment, and the school district declined to provide us with a copy of the flash drive contents.
When we wrote about a similar claim in April, J. Alex Huffman, an aerosol scientist at the University of Denver, explained to us that “there is a wide distribution of particle sizes emitted when people breathe, speak, sing, or cough, but the range is anywhere from tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns. Most of these, even after evaporation, are easily removed by good masks.”
The aerosols and droplets that carry the virus get blocked as air tries to pass through the mask fibers — as Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, have explained in the journal Med.
“Masks work by blocking or filtering out viruses that are carried in aerosols,” the authors wrote. The “air must curve as it flows around individual, tightly packed fibers of the material, like a race car swerving around cones of an obstacle course. As the air curves, the aerosols it carries cannot make the sharp bends and therefore slam into the fibers, or they come too close to the fibers and stick to them.”
As we’ve explained, there have been a number of studies, particularly in labs, showing that face masks can help reduce transmission — though such studies do have their limitations. Also, the material, layers and fit of a mask all factor into how effective it is.
It’s worth noting that masks are not considered to be foolproof — but instead one measure to help limit the spread of COVID-19. For more information on the research surrounding face masks, see our SciCheck story “The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.”
No Support for Immune Enhancement Claim
Stock claims the COVID-19 vaccines “fight the virus wrong and let the virus become worse than it would with native infection.” He blames outbreaks of COVID-19 on “antibody-mediated viral enhancement,” a “condition done when vaccines work wrong, as they did in every coronavirus study done in animals on coronaviruses after the SARS outbreak and done in respiratory syncytial virus.”
As we’ve explained before, that issue — known as antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, or ADE — occurs when a previous infection or vaccination generates antibodies that don’t neutralize the virus but instead enhance the virus’ ability to infect cells, which can lead to a worse illness instead of preventing it.
But ADE hasn’t been an issue in the animal studies and clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines — not to mention their real-world rollout.
The phenomenon in question was indeed seen in a vaccine trial in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Regarding vaccine work on previous coronaviruses, a 2012 study found that vaccine candidates for the coronavirus behind the SARS outbreak of 2003 caused mice to develop eosinophilia — a high count of a type of white blood cells — when exposed to the live virus. Similar issues were encountered in mice tested with a vaccine candidate for MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus.
That’s why vaccine experts publicly discussed the need to be cognizant of potential enhancement issues when COVID-19 vaccine research got underway in early 2020.
“Antibody-dependent Enhancement was one of the questions of concern before development and testing of vaccines,” Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, told us in an email. “But if anything, the data show just the opposite. Breakthrough infections are milder in general to infections in the unvaccinated, particularly around hospitalizations and deaths.”
The vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 continue to be among those not fully vaccinated, as a recent analysis of state-level breakthrough infection data by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows. (Of course, as we’ve explained, when more and more of the population becomes vaccinated, the proportion of cases among vaccinated individuals will also rise.)
In proposing that the vaccines worsen disease, Stock also makes the false claim that the July outbreak of COVID-19 in Provincetown, Massachusetts, was somehow due to the vaccines.
“That is why you are seeing an outbreak right now,” he said. “75% of people who had COVID-19-positive symptom cases in Barnstable, Massachusetts, outbreak, were fully vaccinated,” he added, to applause.
Later, he iterated his claim, saying, “This vaccine was supposedly going to make all this go away, but it suddenly managed to make an outbreak of COVID-19 develop in the middle of the summer.”
But there is no evidence that when outbreaks occur that they’re because of or made worse by vaccination. On the contrary, experts say the vaccines are doing their job, keeping outbreaks from otherwise being more severe.
Here, Stock is distorting the findings of a paper published on July 30 in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which found that 74% of the 469 people included in the study who were infected with the coronavirus after being in Provincetown in the first half of July were vaccinated.
As we have previously explained, however, the 74% is misleading without more context, and doesn’t mean that the vaccines don’t work. That’s because even with a very effective vaccine you still expect some COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people — and the proportion of cases among the immunized can be high if much of the population has been vaccinated.
“The 74% needs to be put in the context that a very high proportion of the people exposed were vaccinated,” William P. Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us. “It suggests that in the absence of vaccination the outbreak would have been much larger.”
While the Provincetown outbreak has garnered a lot of news coverage, it’s far from the only outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, as Stock incorrectly implies. COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the U.S. as the highly contagious delta variant has spread, but particularly so in places with low vaccination rates. Only a tiny fraction of people who have been vaccinated have died or fallen seriously ill from COVID-19, according to federal and state data.
Some Vaccines Do Reduce Infection and Transmission
Stock also falsely claimed that “no vaccine … ever stops infection” and that vaccines do nothing for transmission, citing an outbreak of mumps in the National Hockey League in 2014.
“No vaccine prevents you from getting [an] infection,” he said. “You get infected, you shed pathogen. This is especially true of viral respiratory pathogens. You just don’t get symptomatic from it. So you cannot stop spread, you cannot make these numbers that you’ve planned on get better by doing any of the things you’re doing.”
It’s true that most vaccines aren’t able to prevent infection. But as we’ve written, that’s not a reason to skip vaccination, since the vaccines still work to protect against disease, which is their primary purpose.
And it’s false to claim that no vaccines prevent infection or that vaccines can’t stop the spread of diseases. Some vaccines, such as those for the measles, hepatitis A and human papillomavirus, or HPV, can prevent infection since they trigger sterilizing immunity, which is when antibodies glom onto a pathogen and remove it before it has a chance to enter cells and set up an infection.
Many other vaccines that aren’t able to produce sterilizing immunity nevertheless can reduce transmission because vaccinated people typically shed less virus, for example, making them less contagious.
And in fact, there is evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines do reduce infection and transmission, although not completely — hence the recommendation from public health officials to continue to take some precautions, particularly when transmission levels in the community are high or if you or those around you are more vulnerable to COVID-19.
For example, as the CDC outlines in its scientific brief on vaccination, subsequent data from some of the vaccine clinical trials and multiple studies of real-world effectiveness suggest that immunization reduces asymptomatic infection.
One study from the U.K., published in June in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that household transmission was 40% to 50% lower from infected vaccinated people than from infected unvaccinated people. More than 90% of the vaccinated people in the study had received only one dose of a two-dose vaccine.
The CDC recently changed its guidance on masking for the vaccinated in light of the delta variant, based in part on findings from the Provincetown outbreak showing that, at the time of diagnosis, infected vaccinated and unvaccinated people harbored similar amounts of viral RNA.
But as we’ve noted, viral RNA is not the same as infectious virus, and it’s unlikely that infected vaccinated people would be as contagious as their unvaccinated peers. Even if they are, vaccinated people would still be less likely to spread the virus, since they’re less likely to be infected in the first place.
Throughout his speech, Stock was also focused on saying that “no one can make this virus go away,” contrasting the situation to that of smallpox, which was eradicated more than 40 years ago.
But this is neither news, nor is it relevant to the main purpose of vaccination, which is to get the current pandemic under control with the fewest lives lost. Scientists have suspected for some time that the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, would not just “go away,” as we wrote in May 2020.
Studies Do Show a Vaccination Benefit for Previously Infected
Contrary to Stock’s claim that people who recovered from COVID-19 “get no benefit from vaccination at all,” studies show the COVID-19 vaccines provide an immunity boost to those who previously recovered from an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
For instance, a study by U.K. researchers published Aug. 10 in the journal Science Translational Medicine found that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in previously infected individuals increased the immune response to variants of the coronavirus, including the beta and gamma variants. The researchers evaluated blood samples from 45 health care workers who had been fully vaccinated, comparing a group that had a previous infection with the novel coronavirus with a group that had no evidence of a past infection.
The authors noted that past studies had found a single vaccine dose can improve the immune response of previously infected people. (We wrote about such studies here.) But this research found that natural infection followed by a two-dose regimen of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine increased antibody concentration and neutralization of the gamma and beta variants at a comparable level as to the original virus.
“Our data provide compelling evidence that neutralizing potency and breadth is further increased following a vaccine boost, and this effect is even greater if the vaccine recipient has had prior infection with SARS-CoV-2,” the study said.
In the video, Stock said that studies on his flash drive “show that people who have recovered from COVID infection actually get no benefit from vaccination at all. No reduction in symptoms, no reduction in hospitalization. And suffer 2-4 times the rate of side effects if they are subsequently vaccinated.” It’s unclear to what studies Stock is referring.
A group called Hancock County Patriots listed several studies in an online posting about Stock’s remarks. Among those studies, one would be relevant to this issue, but it doesn’t support Stock’s claim.
That study, published on July 14 in Cell Reports Medicine, evaluated 254 COVID-19 patients over several months, finding that most mounted broad immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 for up to 250 days. The researchers, from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Emory University in Atlanta, didn’t evaluate the impact of vaccination on those patients. They did say the findings suggested that individuals could mount a rapid immune response if they were exposed to COVID-19 again or vaccinated.
An early version of the paper, posted in April before peer-review, included this sentence: “Thus, recovered COVID-19 patients are likely to better defend against the variants than persons who have not been infected but have been immunized with spike-containing vaccines only.” But that sentence was removed before the paper was published, and the lead author of the study told PolitiFact.com that the sentence had been taken out of context.
Kristen Cohen, a senior staff scientist in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, told PolitiFact.com the sentence was a hypothesis, not a definitive finding, in the discussion section. “We did not intend to argue that infected people do not need to get vaccinated or that their immune responses are superior,” Cohen told PolitiFact.
Another study in which Cohen and colleagues at the Fred Hutchinson Center participated, published in Science on June 25, found that vaccination may “offer a valuable boost” to the immune responses against variant viruses of those who had previously been infected.
That study analyzed blood samples from 15 previously infected individuals both before and after one or two doses of the mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, and it analyzed samples from 13 individuals without prior infection after two vaccine doses. It found that a single shot provided the immunity boost for the previously infected. “Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies,” the authors said.
Also, a real-world retrospective study by the CDC in Kentucky found unvaccinated residents who were infected with the coronavirus in 2020 had a 2.34 times higher risk of being reinfected in May and June 2021, compared with those who were fully vaccinated. The study, published Aug. 6 in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, said it suggested that “among previously infected persons, full vaccination is associated with reduced likelihood of reinfection, and, conversely, being unvaccinated is associated with higher likelihood of being reinfected.”
The CDC noted this was a study on one state with a short reinfection period and that more research was needed.
It’s possible Stock was referring to an unpublished study, which hasn’t been peer-reviewed, that followed employees at the Cleveland Clinic Health System for five months, beginning on Dec. 16, 2020, the day vaccination against COVID-19 began. It found that none of the 2,579 previously infected workers got COVID-19 again over those five months. The only group that did see an increase in infections were the previously uninfected who remained unvaccinated.
The observations led the authors to conclude: “Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.” But the Cleveland Clinic issued a statement saying it recommended that everyone who is eligible for the vaccine receive it.
The statement noted that researchers don’t know how long the immune system protects against reinfection, that the population in the study was younger and healthier than the general population, and that more research was needed.
Lack of Evidence for Vitamin D, Ivermectin
Stock suggested that an anti-parasitic drug called ivermectin could be used along with supplements to effectively treat COVID-19, a claim similar to one we’ve addressed before.
“I can tell you,” Stock said in the video, “having treated over 15 COVID-19 patients, that between active loading with vitamin D, ivermectin and zinc, that there is not a single person who has come anywhere near the hospital.”
But available data on ivermectin hasn’t shown a benefit in reducing symptom duration, hospitalization or mortality for COVID-19 patients, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, told us in an email.
As we’ve explained before, neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin in the treatment of COVID-19, and Merck, which manufactures the drug, has similarly noted that there is no “meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease.”
Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, and it’s among a few repurposed medicines that the NIH is studying for use in COVID-19 patients. But the Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved it to treat any viral infections to date.
The FDA has, however, warned against the use of veterinary ivermectin since patients have been hospitalized after taking a version of the drug intended for horses as interest in it as treatment for COVID-19 has grown.
Boulware also addressed Stock’s claim about vitamin D, noting that “observational data have limitations.”
It’s true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system. But that doesn’t mean it’s a panacea for COVID-19, as we’ve explained before.
“Having a low vitamin D level is associated with bad outcomes in COVID-19,” Boulware wrote. “Vitamin D is also associated with bad outcomes in heart disease, cancer, infections, and all sorts of medical conditions. Unfortunately, supplementing vitamin D does not necessary reverse these bad outcomes. But most people do need for Vitamin D in their diets, and taking Vitamin D at normal doses is likely to be beneficial in general and unlikely to be harmful.”

201,"As Deaths Rise, Trump Sticks with Old Numbers",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/as-deaths-rise-trump-sticks-with-old-numbers/,,"During his July 14 press conference from the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump made the outdated claim that U.S. deaths from COVID-19 are down “tenfold.”
Data from three different sources show that, as of July 14, the total number, and seven-day average, of daily deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus had declined between threefold and fourfold from its peak more than two months ago.
Trump made the claim as he argued that news organizations have recently highlighted record increases in cases of the disease in several states, rather than focusing on the fact that deaths from COVID-19 have declined from their previous high.
Trump, July 14: And when I turn on the news, I see, “cases, cases, cases.” They don’t talk about deaths being cut down to a level that — actually, “tenfold,” they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets — “Tenfold.” Cut tenfold. Yes, but they don’t talk about that; they talk about cases.
Trump’s “very respected” source appears to be the Washington Times, which was merely quoting his press secretary. We searched the Nexis news database and couldn’t find any other news organization using the “tenfold” language.
On July 7, Trump tweeted about a Washington Times article that quoted White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying, in a July 6 press briefing, that there had been a “tenfold” decrease in deaths.
“The president is not downplaying the severity of the virus,” McEnany said in response to a reporter’s question about Trump’s false claim that “99%” of COVID-19 cases “are totally harmless.” She explained: “What the president is noting is that at the height of this pandemic we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where on July 4 there were 254. That’s a tenfold decrease in mortality.”
We don’t know where McEnany got those figures; the White House didn’t tell us.
The data aggregation website Worldometer reports that there were 2,748 coronavirus-related deaths on April 21 — at the peak — and 265 deaths on July 4. Those aren’t the same totals McEnany cited — but it was a tenfold decrease, as she said.
However, daily deaths have increased in the days since — including in Arizona, California, Florida, South Carolina and Texas — meaning Trump’s “tenfold” talking point is stale.
On July 14, the day of Trump’s press conference, there were 935 deaths, according to Worldometer. That’s only a threefold decrease from the number of deaths on April 21.
Slightly different totals from two other sources also show less of a decline in daily deaths than Trump claimed.
There was a high of 2,752 deaths on April 15 and a total of 954 deaths on July 14, according to the New York Times. That’s a threefold decrease, as well.
In addition, the COVID Tracking Project reports that there were 736 deaths on July 14, which would be a nearly fourfold decrease from the peak of 2,742 deaths it reports for May 7. We have included a chart of that website’s totals to better illustrate how the number of daily deaths has changed over time. (Scroll to the right to see the full chart.)
<a href='https:&#47;&#47;covidtracking.com&#47;'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CT&#47;CTPWebsiteGallery&#47;3_USDeath&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>                   
There also hasn’t been a tenfold decline in the seven-day average of deaths, which accounts for fluctuations in daily totals over a full week.
Here are those averages at their high point, and on July 14, according to Worldometer, the New York Times and the COVID Tracking Project.




7-Day Average of COVID-19 Deaths

Each source shows a decline of less than fourfold over those time periods.
Trump does have a point that daily deaths from COVID-19 “are way down” from their previous highs, as Trump noted in a July 9 interview on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show. The president claimed a “tenfold” decrease in “mortality” then, too. But on July 9, the number of daily deaths was already higher than it had been over the July 4 weekend.
And on July 14, it also was no longer the case that deaths had been “cut tenfold,” which is what Trump said in the Rose Garden. He has simply ignored the increases in daily deaths that have occurred since July 4.

202,"Posts Distort Facts on Coronavirus Air Transmission, Masks",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/posts-distort-facts-on-coronavirus-air-transmission-masks/,,"Quick Take
Facebook posts make the unsubstantiated suggestion that the novel coronavirus is infectious in the air for “8 hrs,” and falsely claim that “everyone is required to wear mask everywhere!” There was no requirement for healthy people to wear masks when the claims were made; health officials later recommended wearing masks, and some states require them in public settings.


Full Story 
Update, July 14: This story was published before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began advising people to wear face coverings in public settings. Many states now have laws mandating masks in public settings. Our most recent coverage on COVID-19 can be found here. We have updated the Quick Take. The original story is as follows.
As the health care system in the U.S. faces shortages of face masks and other protective gear for workers fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic, some Facebook posts are sending the wrong message by claiming that wearing a face mask is now a requirement for everyone.
The posts falsely claim that “everyone is required to wear mask everywhere,” because “COVID-19” — the disease caused by the virus — “is confirmed as airborne and remain 8 hrs in air!”
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend face masks for healthy people, but says they should be worn “by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms.” It notes that the “use of facemasks also is crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).”
So there’s no requirement that “everyone” wear a mask at all times.
The Facebook posts further leave a misleading impression when saying the coronavirus (formally known as SARS-CoV-2) is “airborne and remain 8 hrs in air!” The term “airborne,” we note, is used differently by different people and is the subject of some debate.
Public health officials have thus far said they do not believe the virus is widely spread through the air. But new studies suggest air transmission could be a factor, especially in health care settings.
A study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine called aerosol transmission “plausible.” The study involved an experiment using a nebulizer to show that the virus “remained viable in aerosols” for up to three hours. The term “aerosol” refers to virus particles being suspended in the air; more on that shortly.
But, importantly, the study estimated that the virus had a half-life of approximately 1.1 to 1.2 hours in aerosols — meaning half of the viral particles were no longer infectious after a little over an hour.
The amount of virus projected into the air would affect the total time that some of it remains infectious, according to Dylan Morris, a Princeton University researcher and co-author of the study. Certain conditions, such as humidity, could also affect how long it remains infectious.
The Facebook posts, however, leave the unfounded impression that the virus is infectious in the air for “8 hrs.” A CNBC article referenced in the posts does not claim as much.
Morris told us by email that “the ‘airborne’ question bedevils scientists trying to communicate with the public. It combines a locus of substantial public fear with a question of true scientific nuance — a recipe for a misinformation mess.”
“Many viruses — from measles to flu, and including SARS-CoV-2 — are ‘airborne’ in the sense that one way of getting sick is to inhale virus particles (‘virions’) sneezed or coughed into the air within respiratory secretions,” he said. Some secretions are bigger (often called “droplets”) and some smaller (thought of as “aerosols”), he said, though there’s a spectrum.
“The tricky crux of the matter is that when people say ‘airborne’, what they often mean is ‘you’re at risk from virus particles hanging in the air — or being kicked back up into the air after falling to the ground — long, long after an infectious person sneezed them out,'” he said. “That’s much more of a risk for smaller, ‘aerosol’-end-of-the-spectrum secretions. And it turns out that it’s more of a risk for some viruses than for others.”
Measles is very airborne, he said, but the flu is less so — “even though both measles and flu can in principle be found both in aerosol-like and in droplet-like secretions. So far, scientists mainly think COVID looks more like flu” in that way.
Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, said we don’t have enough evidence of how exactly the coronavirus is being spread between people.
“We do know transmission is much more likely if you’re close to someone who’s sick,” Marr said. In terms of the virus being potentially transmitted in the air, she uses the analogy of being directly next to someone smoking a cigarette; the farther away you are from someone releasing the virus into the air, the lesser the concentration.
“The ‘airborne’ term scares people — they envision this cloud of viruses that roams around the neighborhood that can infect them,” she said. “The important thing [to know] is that virus released in the air from a patient is usually quickly diluted unless you’re in a really small space.” And over time, the “level of risk becomes much, much lower.”
Marr added that larger droplets could also land on the floor or a desk, surfaces which people may touch and then touch their faces or mouths — also putting them at risk of infection. That’s why public health officials stress frequent hand-washing.
And while the Facebook posts suggest the “airborne” factor necessitates the healthy public at large (“everyone”) wear masks “everywhere,” experts say it’s health care workers who truly need them most.
“Where nobody disagrees is that there are frighteningly plausible aerosol transmission risks in hospital settings, since medical procedures involved in treating COVID can produce aerosols,” Morris said. “This is a major reason why hospitals are in such critical need of appropriate protective equipment for frontline healthcare workers (e.g. N95 masks).”
Marr, too, said the limited supply is most needed by health care workers.
“If there is a shortage of masks, which is the case here, then they should be reserved for health care workers,” she said. “Even coughing, breathing and talking can generate aerosols,” she said, so “health care workers close to patients … should be wearing proper respiratory protection.”
Morris suggests that members of the public, some of whom could be infected but not show symptoms, can follow online tutorials to create their own surgical masks — covering the nose and mouth — to wear in public settings, like the grocery store. While such masks don’t prevent the person wearing it from becoming infected, they can help those who are unknowingly sick avoid inadvertently contaminating the environment.
In short, there is emerging evidence that the virus may be “airborne,” but that term requires context and experts say the primary concern is direct contact with people infected with the disease. And the idea that the virus remains infectious in the air for “8 hrs” is not supported — and there’s no requirement that people wear masks at all times.

Facebook posts make the unsubstantiated suggestion that the novel coronavirus is infectious in the air for “8 hrs,” and falsely claim that “everyone is required to wear mask everywhere!” There was no requirement for healthy people to wear masks when the claims were made; health officials later recommended wearing masks, and some states require them in public settings."
203,Spoof Video Furthers Microchip Conspiracy Theory,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-spoof-video-furthers-microchip-conspiracy-theory/,,"
Conspiracy theories about microchips in COVID-19 vaccines started circulating before any vaccines were even available.
The first one we wrote about was in April 2020 — eight months before the first vaccines rolled out in the U.S. Most recently, we debunked a claim that magnets were sticking to the arms of vaccinated people, allegedly proving that they had microchips in their arms.
Now a similar claim is circulating in a video that originated on TikTok, where it’s been viewed more than 15 million times, and has been copied and shared widely on Facebook.
The video shows a veterinary clinic worker in Ohio who says to someone off camera, “Look what I just figured out, Justine. Scan this arm.” A microchip reader for pets then appears and scans her arm, showing nothing. “Now here’s my vaccinated arm,” she says, and the scanner shows a series of numbers.
The original video was shared with the hashtags, “#vaccinesideeffect #chipped #chipfinder #covidvaccine #covidvaccinesideeffects.” After the video had received millions of views and thousands of comments, the person who posted it wrote, “you guys clearly don’t know what a joke [is]. it’s obviously a dog chip… you guys believe anything on the internet.”
We reached out for further comment, but didn’t hear back.
Copies of the video that have been circulating on Facebook give no indication that it was made as a joke, and one version, which has received 11,000 views, was posted with this text: “They are literally tagging and tracking everybody taking the Jab.”
But, as we’ve explained before, a list of the ingredients for each vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. is publicly available, and the ingredients don’t include microchips.
Also, the manufacturer of the detection device shown in the video uses microchips that it describes on its website as being about the size of a grain of rice, 1.4 millimeters wide by 10.3 millimeters long.
The needles used to administer the COVID-19 vaccines are much smaller than that. They deliver the vaccine through a tube that measures less than half a millimeter wide.
So, as with the other microchip claims we’ve addressed, this video doesn’t prove anything nefarious about the COVID-19 vaccines.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-07-02 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"Copies of the video that have been circulating on Facebook give no indication that it was made as a joke, and one version, which has received 11,000 views, was posted with this text: “They are literally tagging and tracking everybody taking the Jab.”

204,Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-and-the-coronavirus-death-rate/,,"7.9KThe World Health Organization says that 3.4% of reported COVID-19 patients worldwide have died – a global fatality figure that President Donald Trump dismissed as “a false number.” It’s not a false number, although experts say Trump has a point that the fatality rate may ultimately be quite a bit less than 3.4%.
Trump says the true rate is much lower because the WHO’s rate does not take into account unreported cases. The WHO rate comes from the actual number of known cases and fatalities.
The dispute began March 3 when the head of the WHO announced that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus was 3.4%, which was higher than previously believed and made it far more deadly than the seasonal flu.
“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 (the disease spread by the virus) cases have died,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a briefing. “By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.”
He said there had been 90,893 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3,110 deaths.
Trump challenged that number. “Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,” Trump said in a telephone interview March 4 with Fox News’ Sean Hannity.
The problem, the president said, was that many people with mild cases of coronavirus simply weren’t being counted, resulting in a deceptively high figure for the percentage who have died.
Trump, March 4: Now, this is just my hunch, and — but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this, and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people. So, you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and — or virus. So you just can’t do that. So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California — I believe you had one in New York — you know, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4%, which is a very high number, as opposed to — as opposed to a fraction of 1%. But, again, they don’t — they don’t know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don’t go to the hospital. They don’t report to doctors or the hospital in many cases.
The actual mortality rate, Trump said, “is way under 1%.”
For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, told us in a January email.
A number of disease experts agree with Trump that there are many unreported cases and that the rate reported by the WHO is higher than the rate will end up being over time. It’s relatively easy to know how many people have died from the disease. But it takes a while to have a fuller sense of how many people have it, for the reason Trump cited — they have a mild case and haven’t sought treatment — or because they don’t even know they have it. And very little testing has been done. In other words, experts say, we have the numerator but not the denominator.
In time, and once much more testing has been carried out, the rate will fall, they say. But one WHO expert who visited China doesn’t think there are that many undiagnosed cases.
Vaccine expert Paul A. Offit told us the rate could go below 1% as Trump says. “I think Trump is right,” said Offit, who holds the Maurice R. Hilleman Chair of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Offit likens the situation to the swine flu epidemic of 2009. At one point, he said, the mortality rate was thought to be much higher than the 0.01 to 0.03% it turned out to be. He thinks the mortality rate for coronavirus will similarly plummet and the “false notion that it is more likely to kill you than influenza” will disappear.
Offit believes there has been a “wild overreaction” to the disease, in part because it is new. “We’re more the victim of fear than the virus,” he said.
Other experts agree that mortality rates at this point in an outbreak are wobbly since its full extent is not known. Fisman told us in January that statistics at the time might not tell the full story. He said it was likely far more people had been infected, but had not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. At the same time, he pointed out that some of the people who are sick might die, pushing the rate in the other direction.
Gary Kobinger, director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec, told the health website STAT in February that it would be highly unusual if there weren’t mild cases that had been missed. The website’s article said: “He pointed to the fact that outbreaks have popped up in countries far from China — including Iran and Italy — because people with mild infections were not detected and traveled to other places.
“There are mild cases that are undetected. This is why it’s spreading. Otherwise it would not be spreading because we would know where those cases are and they would be contained and that would be the end of it,” Kobinger told STAT.
But there is by no means unanimity on the subject. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist who led a WHO team to inspect China’s response to coronavirus, doesn’t believe there are nearly as many undiagnosed cases as other scientists do.
“There is no evidence that we’re seeing only the tip of a grand iceberg, with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus,” he told the New York Times. “What we’re seeing is a pyramid: most of it is aboveground.”
In Guangdong, he said, “they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province.” He concluded, “Once we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I’ll be saying, ‘Guess what? Those data didn’t tell us the story.’ But the data we have now don’t support it.”
A Feb. 28 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, took the position that the mortality rate may well fall dramatically. It said if one assumed that there were several times as many people who had the disease with minimal or no symptoms as the number of reported cases, the mortality rate may be considerably less than 1%. That would suggest “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza,” the editorial said. 
After the WHO announced the 3.4% mortality rate, a number of medical experts asserted that the rate would shrink over time.
“When we see systems that are able to account for not only the really sick, but also those who have infection and are outpatients, the CFR [case fatality rate] is more accurate and drops considerably,” Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said in an interview with the website Vox. 
Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, had a similar view. He told Vox, “To get a rate, you need the deaths — which you can more reliably pick up — and you need cases, which you can less reliably pick up. It’s not irresponsible to come out with that number, but it should have been more clearly interpreted as not being reliable, or at least mention it’ll vary in regions.”
A February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of cases in China found a mortality rate of 2.3%. But the new coronavirus hit the elderly particularly hard: The rate was 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79.",Rem Rieder,2020-03-05 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"The actual mortality rate, Trump said, “is way under 1%.”

205,Trump Falsely Claims COVID-19 Death Projection Assumes ‘No Mitigation’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-falsely-claims-covid-19-death-projection-assumes-no-mitigation/,,"Dismissing concerns that states are reopening too soon, President Donald Trump incorrectly said that a newly revised model projecting 134,000 COVID-19 deaths by August “assumes no mitigation.” In fact, the model assumes states will keep their existing social distancing measures in place, unless suspensions have already been announced.
Trump’s error came when he was asked about a model from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The group’s modeling efforts previously figured prominently in presentations from the White House’s coronavirus task force, and until a few days ago, had been projecting around 72,000 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus by August. According to Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracker, there were already more than 70,000 deaths as of May 5.
Reporter, May 5: Mr. President, on the IHME model, which is now showing 134,000 deaths by August, doubling its previous prediction, are you concerned that that’s happening because some of these states are relaxing guidelines too early?
Trump: No. No, I’m not, because that — that assumes no mitigation.
Reporter: Assumes less?
Trump: And we’re going to have mitigation. No, we’re letting people out. But the fact that we’re letting people go and go to their jobs — they have to do it.
When asked later if he believed the death toll numbers, Trump again suggested that the higher estimate from the model was because it didn’t incorporate any mitigation efforts.
“Well, that’s with no mitigation. We’re doing mitigation. We have a lot of mitigation,” he said. “The fact that they’re out — they’re mitigating. They’re social distancing. They all know that. They’re washing their hands a lot. But we have to get our country open. We have to open our country.”
The president then proceeded to draw attention to a different death estimate, made by Imperial College London early on in the pandemic, that unlike the IHME model, was done assuming no mitigation.
“I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said. “But, you know, one model that’s very important is that if we did this a different way, we would have lost more — much more than 2 million people. And we did it the right way. We did everything right. But now it’s time to go back to work.”
In a March 16 report, researchers with Imperial College London projected as many as 2.2 million deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus in “the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour.”
It’s fair for Trump to note that some models haven’t performed well, and to be skeptical of them in general. 
Many experts have been especially critical of IHME’s methods, as they essentially take previously reported COVID-19 death data from around the world and try to extrapolate those patterns and apply them to other outbreaks, without accounting for differences in how those outbreaks are being handled. That’s in contrast to epidemiological modeling, which actually tries to use what’s known about the virus and how it spreads to model disease transmission in a population.
But Trump is wrong to say IHME’s model doesn’t include any mitigation. As Amelia Apfel, a media relations officer for IHME, told us, “[O]ur model has always assumed mitigation.”
The new IHME model, which was released on May 4 and now includes some elements of disease transmission modeling, incorporates a variety of government-mandated social distancing policies.
This is most obvious when viewing IHME’s projections for individual states. The top of each page shows which policies the model is assuming are in effect.
“As of May 4, our forecasts now account for locations that have lifted social distancing measures and assumes those measures will remain lifted through August 4,” the website says. “For locations that have not lifted social distancing, the model assumes measures will stay in place through August 4.”
The state of New York, for example, has not suspended any of its mandates, so the model’s projections are based on the idea that schools and businesses remain shuttered, and gathering restrictions and stay-at-home orders are in place. In Colorado, some social distancing measures still apply, but the model is factoring in that the stay-at-home order was lifted and some businesses were allowed to reopen.
IHME’s website further explains that it only classifies measures as being in place if they pertain to the entire population within a given state. So, if a city had ordered schools to be closed, but that order didn’t pertain statewide, the measure wouldn’t be part of the model.
Apfel said that the team incorporated information about states’ social distancing policies, including any that had ended or were scheduled to end, as of May 3. “[A]s we update going forward,” she said, “we’ll be rolling in changes to state social distancing policies that we’re able to verify.”
The model, then, reflects some relaxation of policies as states begin to reopen, but is still trying to capture the mitigation efforts that remain. This is one of the key reasons why the IHME numbers increased — to 134,475, with a range between 95,092 and 242,890 — relative to its earlier estimates.
“The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” explains a press release for the new model.
It remains to be seen whether the new IHME estimate is anywhere close to being accurate, but the president was incorrect to say the model “assumes no mitigation.”

206,Trump’s Misleading COVID-19 Comparisons to Other Countries,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/trumps-misleading-covid-19-comparisons-to-other-countries/,,"In a flurry of tweets and remarks, President Donald Trump continued to distort the facts on the coronavirus pandemic:

In a series of comments focused on the surging number of COVID-19 cases elsewhere in the world, Trump left the misleading impression that the U.S. is doing better than several countries seeing recent upticks in cases. But nearly all of the nations he mentioned still have fewer new daily per capita cases than the U.S.
The president said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force member, was “wrong” that Europe was more successful in reducing new cases partly because countries had more restrictive lockdowns than the U.S. Instead, Trump inaccurately insisted that the U.S. has more cases because of more testing.
Trump repeated the misleading claim that COVID-19 cases are “up” in the U.S. “because of BIG Testing.” Cases are high because of ongoing transmission, not just because of testing. Coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that the recent outbreaks, unlike those in the early days of the pandemic, are “extraordinarily widespread.”

Resurgences in Other Countries
In recent remarks, Trump has noted that other nations are currently experiencing worrisome upticks in coronavirus cases. While this is true, his emphasis and description of these surges could leave audiences incorrectly believing the U.S. is in better shape than certain parts of Europe and Asia.
In a July 30 press briefing, for example, the president referred to “tremendous problems” occurring across the globe.
Trump, July 30: All over the world, they’re having tremendous problems. A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet — in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong — places where they thought it was — they had really done great. It came back. And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly.
He then gave a few eye-popping statistics of the amount of growth in coronavirus cases in select countries. 
“Since the beginning of June,” he said, “daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times — that’s 35 times — in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised.”
Later, in an Aug. 2 tweet, Trump retweeted information about a state of disaster declaration in Victoria, Australia, adding, “Big China Virus breakouts all over the World, including nations which were thought to have done a great job. The Fake News doesn’t report this. USA will be stronger than ever before, and soon!”
The following day, Trump alluded to other countries having a “major second wave” of cases in another tweet, and said that the U.S had handled the virus “MUCH better.”
The White House did not respond to our request for more information, so we are not sure which exact days or the source he used in making his comparisons. The factor increases Trump cited are in line, if not lower, than the numbers from Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford. But importantly, the large changes are only possible because those countries had very few new coronavirus cases in early June.
Japan, for instance, had only 33 new cases on June 1, which increased some 34 times to 1,126 cases by July 30, the day of Trump’s remarks. Similarly, Australia and Israel had only 10 and 59 cases, respectively, on June 1, which rose 28 and 34 times to 278 and 2,001 cases on July 30.
In contrast, the U.S. didn’t experience such a large change — less than a 4-fold increase — but started and ended with more daily cases: 19,807 new cases on June 1 and 74,985 new cases on July 30.
Adjusted for population, only Israel is similar to the U.S. in terms of new COVID-19 cases, and had a slightly higher seven-day average figure than the U.S. on July 30. As of Aug. 4, Israel has dipped below the U.S.; Australia has more than nine times fewer new cases per capita than the U.S. and Japan has more than 16 times fewer cases, per Our World in Data’s seven-day rolling average.

Importantly, all of the nations Trump singled out for having resurgences successfully reduced their case numbers to low levels in May and June, which the U.S. did not manage to do.
And even with the rise in cases now, all the nations Trump mentioned, other than Israel, are far below the U.S.’s seven-day average per capita case count of 183 cases per million people per day.

Hong Kong, which is not included in Our World of Data, is posting no more than 150 cases per day, per Worldometer, or about 20 cases per million people. The U.S. has more than nine times that many new daily cases per million people. 
And while Trump repeatedly suggests that the U.S. has more cases because of more testing, it isn’t true that these other nations aren’t testing as much. With the exception of Hong Kong, all of the nations singled out by Trump have been conducting more tests per coronavirus case identified than the U.S.
In an Aug. 3 press briefing, the president again noted “very significant flare ups” in Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, and in response to a question about the state of the pandemic in the U.S., said, “I think we’re doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation.”
“If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flareups and nations that they were talking about,” he said. “Don’t forget, we’re much bigger, other than India and China. China’s having a massive flareup right down. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.”
The U.S., by a variety of metrics, has not “done as well as any nation.” 
The outbreaks in numerous countries have been smaller and led to fewer deaths, even when including more recent upticks. South Korea, for instance, quickly brought its number of cases down after a burst of infections in March and has largely kept it that way, limiting the total number of cases to fewer than 15,000 and deaths to 301. Australia’s outbreak has also been puny by comparison, with fewer than 20,000 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 232 deaths as of Aug. 4. 
The U.S., meanwhile, has racked up more than 4.7 million cases and more than 156,000 deaths, according to the COVID-19 dashboard from Johns Hopkins University. That works out to 14,240 cases per million U.S. residents, versus 281 per million in South Korea and 718 per million in Australia.
As of Aug. 4, the U.S. had a mortality rate of 47.5 per 100,000 people, but Australia (0.93), Japan (0.8), South Korea (0.58) all have mortality rates of less than 1 person per 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins.
In an interview with Axios that aired Aug. 3, Trump objected to focusing on deaths as a proportion of the population, pointing instead to deaths as a proportion of total cases. “You have to go by the cases,” he said, claiming that the statistic showed the U.S. is “lower than Europe.”
The U.S. has a case-fatality rate of 3.3%, lower than many countries in Europe, including France, Spain and Germany. But there are also many countries with lower rates than the U.S., including Australia (1.2%), Japan (2.5%), Israel (0.7%) and South Korea (2.1%).
That measure shows how deadly the disease has been for those who have been identified as infected, but looking at deaths per 100,000 population shows how the disease has affected the total population of a country.
Nor is the current situation in the U.S. particularly rosy. On July 29, researchers at Johns Hopkins released a report urging changes to America’s pandemic response. “Unlike many countries in the world,” the authors wrote, “the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic.”
All countries must be prepared for resurgences in COVID-19 cases, which at times may grow rapidly. But Trump omits the fact that viral transmission in the U.S. never declined substantially, unlike many of the countries experiencing upticks, and that there are more new daily per capita cases in the U.S. than in virtually all of the nations he highlighted.
Fauci on Europe’s Shutdown
The president also claimed in a tweet that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was “wrong” in saying in a July 31 congressional hearing that more restrictive lockdowns in European countries led to a sharper decline in cases than what the U.S. has achieved. Trump falsely claimed the difference was due to testing. “We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country,” he said.

Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France & Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard & smart. We will come back STRONG!

In the congressional hearing, Fauci was asked by Rep. James Clyburn, chairman of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, “why Europe has largely contained the virus” while “the United States has seen a continued rise in new cases?” Clyburn showed a chart of the daily new confirmed coronavirus cases per million people for the U.S. and Europe.
Fauci, July 31: The answer to that question is really somewhat complex but I’ll try maybe to very briefly go through what I believe are at least some of the factors that were involved. If you look at what happened in Europe when they shut down or locked down or went to shelter in place, however you want to describe it, they really did it to the tune of about 95 plus percent of the country did that. When you actually look at what we did even though we shut down, even though it created a great deal of difficulty, we really functionally shut down only about 50% in the sense of the totality of the country. Which means when we reached our peak as they did, they came down almost to a low baseline as you’ve shown very clearly.
But take a look at what happened to our baseline, we came up, down and then we plateaued at about 20,000 cases a day. So, we started off with a very difficult baseline of transmission that was going on at the time that we tried to open up the country.
Fauci went on to say that some states reopened “very well” and others didn’t, and the latter “led to the surging that you’re showing on your chart there. And one of the reasons is not doing some of the things that [CDC Director] Dr. Redfield mentioned in his opening statement, universal wearing of masks, avoiding crowds, forced physical distancing, et cetera, et cetera. So it’s a complicated reason why those charts are that way and hopefully as we’re going forward we can turn those around and I do believe we can.”
Here’s a version of the chart Clyburn showed:

Trump’s alternative explanation for the difference — “We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country” — reminded us of the president’s claim in a July “Fox News Sunday” interview that other countries, later mentioning Europe, are only testing for COVID-19 if someone is “really sick” and that the “massive” testing in the U.S. “skews the numbers.” As we found, many countries, including in Europe, have conducted more tests per confirmed case than the U.S.
Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, told us in an email that “tests per confirmed case provides an indication of how aggressively a country is testing. And many countries are at much higher rates than the US.”
As of Aug. 3, the U.S. had conducted 12.3 tests per confirmed case of COVID-19, using the seven-day rolling average figures from Our World in Data. That’s fewer tests per case than 20-some European countries, with the exclusion of France and Sweden – though the available information for those two countries dates back to early July and May.
Among the countries the president has recently mentioned, Spain has conducted 16.3 tests per confirmed case as of July 30, and Germany has done 39 as of July 26. Israel (26.4), Japan (22.3) and Australia (244.8) all have conducted more tests per confirmed case.
Testing Not Sole Cause of Increase in Cases
Trump once again made the misleading claim, in an Aug. 3 tweet, that coronavirus cases in the U.S. have gone “up because of BIG Testing.” As we’ve written, increased testing will lead to more cases, but it doesn’t account for all of the uptick in some parts of the country. The percentage of tests that were positive also went up in many states.
When we looked into this issue in June, Katherine Ellingson, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, told us that the data on cases and testing “suggests that community transmission is increasing, and that increasing case counts are not simply an artifact of testing.”
In some of the hard-hit states, the percentage of tests that were positive increased significantly this summer. For example, in Arizona, the seven-day average for the test positivity rate, as analyzed by Johns Hopkins University, was around 7% in mid-May, spiked to more than 27% in July and has now declined to 18%. 
Florida had a 5% positivity rate or lower for nearly all of May, but for most of July into August, the rate has been above 18%. In Texas, the positivity rate was around 5% at the end of May, hit nearly 18% in July and was about 12% to 14% in recent days.
As of Aug. 4, Johns Hopkins University shows 33 states experiencing an increase in the seven-day positivity rate.
Trump chooses to focus instead on states that are below 5%. He said in an Aug. 3 press briefing: “Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates under 5%,” mentioning Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and New York, among others.
Some areas also have seen increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, which should not occur if additional testing is the only driver of more coronavirus cases.
Two members of the White House’s coronavirus task force also have contradicted Trump’s claims about testing. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the task force, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Aug. 2 that the U.S. was in a “new phase” of the outbreak and that the virus was “more widespread.”
“What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread. It’s into the rural as equal urban areas,” Birx said. “To everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus.”
She recommended those in multigenerational households in areas where there is an outbreak “consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you’re positive, if you have individuals in your households with comorbidities.”
(Trump tweeted that after being criticized by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Birx “took the bait & hit us. Pathetic!”)
Fauci told members of the House in that July 31 hearing: “We see, if you do more testing, you’re going to see more cases. But the increases that we’re seeing are real increasing in cases, as also reflected by increasing in hospitalization and increasing in deaths.”
The seven-day rolling average of deaths per million people in the United States has gone up, from less than or around 2 in late June and early July to 3.38 on July 31, the day Fauci made his remarks, according to Our World in Data.

“If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flareups and nations that they were talking about,” he said.

Later, in an Aug. 2 tweet, Trump retweeted information about a state of disaster declaration in Victoria, Australia, adding, “Big China Virus breakouts all over the World, including nations which were thought to have done a great job. “You have to go by the cases,” he said, claiming that the statistic showed the U.S. is “lower than Europe.”

207,Flawed Report Fuels Erroneous Claims About COVID-19 Death Toll,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-flawed-study-fuels-erroneous-claims-about-covid-19-death-toll/,,"
A conservative talk radio host recently told her listeners that because of a change in death certificate procedures specific to COVID-19, “there is a huge chance that COVID death numbers are exaggerated, to the tune of 94%.”
That’s false. It’s based on a flawed report whose authors also have penned related claims for an anti-vaccination organization.
Wendy Bell, the radio host, made the claim in a March 25 episode of her Pennsylvania-based show. The show was streamed live on Facebook in a video titled, “Has the CDC skewed Covid Fatalities?” It has been viewed more than 34,000 times.

“I’ve reported multiple times that the CDC has said in its own little asterisk, bottom footnote: Of all deaths reported by coroners and health departments to the CDC, only 6% list COVID as the cause of death,” Bell says about 41 minutes into her video. “COVID is what killed this individual — not the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever, and then they got tested in the morgue, but COVID. That 6% number is very significant, and now the CDC is walking it back.”
We’re not sure what she means by the “CDC is walking it back.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website still makes note of the statistic that she’s referencing. But the statistic doesn’t mean, as Bell implies, that COVID-19 didn’t actually cause the other deaths.
We addressed similar social media posts in September that misrepresented CDC data on COVID-19 deaths. As we wrote, CDC data showed COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on 6% of death certificates, while the other 94% of deaths included other illnesses or conditions, or comorbidities.
That’s not unusual since COVID-19 often causes other serious conditions, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome — which rank among the most-cited comorbidities for deaths involving COVID-19. Long-term conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19, such as diabetes or hypertension, are also among the comorbidities listed on death certificates.
The CDC notes, however, that 91% of all death certificates mentioning COVID-19 listed it as the underlying cause of death — or the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death.
Report’s Origins
Now, Bell repeats the distortion about the 6% statistic and cites a paper that erroneously suggests the data is inflated because the CDC changed how such deaths are counted, and falsely claims it violated federal law.
Reading from a March 19 story in the conservative outlet the Epoch Times, Bell tells her listeners: “A little-noticed peer-reviewed study published last October by a science and public health journal claims the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ignored federal laws and regulations when it changed how the government counts deaths from COVID-19, caused by the Wuhan virus.”
The paper referenced appeared in a publication called Science, Public Health Policy, and The Law. The publication started in 2019 and is the product of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, an organization run by James Lyons-Weiler. Lyons-Weiler is a scientist with a Ph.D. in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology from the University of Nevada, Reno, who has previously spread false information about COVID-19 vaccines.
Most of the paper’s authors also wrote a related post, cited in the report, for Children’s Health Defense, an organization run by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. 
We reached out to the report’s lead author, Henry Ealy, a naturopathic doctor based in Oregon, with some questions about its main points and didn’t receive an on-the-record response.
In addition to Bell and the Epoch Times, the paper’s claims have been amplified by other conservative outlets. A February story on the website the National File — headlined “BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law” — was shared more than 16,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data.
Guidance Didn’t Violate Federal Law
The paper’s authors say that, “[b]ased upon our investigation of Federal Register Records for 2020, there was no formal, transparent, public review process initiated by the NVSS or CDC prior to or following the issuance of the March 24th NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 that dramatically altered cause of death reporting exclusively for COVID-19.”
The March 24, 2020, alert being referenced came from the National Vital Statistics System, part of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. It notified the public of a new International Classifications of Diseases code for COVID-19 — since the disease was new, there was no previous code — and offered brief guidance on using it.
Days after the March 24 alert, the CDC issued April 2, 2020, guidance explaining more thoroughly how COVID-19 death certificates should be completed. (The agency has issued similar death reporting guidance for other issues, such as for fatalities due to drug toxicity and relating to disaster events.)
In short, the paper’s authors argue that the March 24 notice was subject to the Information Quality Act and Paperwork Reduction Act — and therefore should have been publicized in the Federal Register and subject to public comment.
But there’s no support for that claim.
First of all, we should note that there is no federal law governing death certificate processes.
Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email that “the collection of death certificate data is not covered by the [Paperwork Reduction Act],” as the paper suggests.
“Death certificate data is collected by the states (i.e., 57 jurisdictions, including 50 states, New York City, District of Columbia and 5 territories), according to state laws and regulations, not according to federal laws or regulations,” he said. “While CDC, i.e., the National Center for Health Statistics, does work with the states to coordinate and promote standardized data collection, along with guidance on some issues such as cause of death certification, NCHS does not (and cannot) impose any legal requirements.”
Anderson said that states develop laws and regulations with the standards in mind, and “[o]nce the data are collected by the states, NCHS purchases the data from the states in order to provide national statistics.”
Bridget Dooling, a research professor at the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, said that since the collection of death certificate data isn’t subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, the CDC’s March 24 guidance wouldn’t be, either.
Dooling — who worked at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the White House Office of Management and Budget, from 2007 to 2018 — also said in a phone interview that the guidance wouldn’t be subject to the Information Quality Act, since those provisions relate to the ways in which government disseminates information.
Public health legal experts similarly told our fact-checking colleagues at AFP that the CDC’s guidance didn’t violate federal law.
Baseless Claim of Reporting Change
In addition to the claim about the legality of the CDC’s COVID-19 death reporting guidance, the paper’s main contention is that the guidance was a stark departure from the CDC’s guidelines used since 2003. It baselessly suggests that, using the 2003 guidance, COVID-19 fatalities would “be approximately 16.7 times lower than is currently being reported.”
“If the fatality data being presented by the CDC is illegally inflated, then all public health policies based upon them would be immediately null and void,” the authors wrote.
But the paper misconstrues how death certificates are completed, experts say, and wrongly concludes that a massive change occurred.
“The death certification process has not been changed by the CDC,” Dr. James Gill, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, told us in an email. “I still fill out death certificates the way I have been doing it for over 20 years.”
Gill, the chief medical examiner in Connecticut, pointed out that the paper illustrates a misunderstanding of how death certificates are completed.
For example, the paper says that Part I of the death certificate “is the immediate cause of death listed in sequential order from the official cause on line item (a) to the underlying causes that contributed to death in descending order of importance on line item (d).”
But it’s the most important diagnosis — the underlying cause of death — that is to be listed on the lowest line of Part I, Gill said. The condition immediately preceding death (such as pneumonia) would be listed first and then the illness that caused that condition (COVID-19, for example) would be listed below it.
Similarly, Anderson, the chief of the CDC’s mortality statistics branch, said the “authors of the October paper do not seem to understand how death certificates are designed or how the cause of death should be certified.”
A comparison of the 2003 guidelines and the COVID-19 guidance doesn’t reveal any significant change in procedure.
“Part I is for reporting a chain of events leading directly to death, with the immediate cause of death (the final disease, injury, or complication directly causing death) on line (a) and the underlying cause of death (the disease or injury that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death) on the lowest used line,” the 2003 guidelines say. “Part II is for reporting all other significant diseases, conditions, or injuries that contributed to death but which did not result in the underlying cause of death given in Part I.”
And here’s how the CDC explained the completion of death certificates in its April 2020 guidance specific to COVID-19, beginning with Part I:
CDC, “Guidance for Certifying Deaths Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19),” April 2, 2020: This section on the death certificate is for reporting the sequence of conditions that led directly to death. The immediate cause of death, which is the disease or condition that directly preceded death and is not necessarily the underlying cause of death (UCOD), should be reported on line a. The conditions that led to the immediate cause of death should be reported in a logical sequence in terms of time and etiology below it. The UCOD, which is “(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury” (7), should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I. … Other significant conditions that contributed to the death, but are not a part of the sequence in Part I, should be reported in Part II. Not all conditions present at the time of death have to be reported—only those conditions that actually contributed to death.
So it’s not accurate to claim that the CDC’s COVID-19 guidance represented a significant departure from the 2003 guidelines, as the paper repeatedly says.
It’s unclear why the authors conclude that, under the 2003 guidelines, COVID-19 would have been “more correctly” included “in Part II as an infection that contributed to death.”
The authors also say that the “inclusion of probable fatalities” is indicative that the “data presented is inaccurate.”
But the 2003 document, in fact, notes that the cause of death is to be determined according to the best medical opinion — and clearly states: “A condition can be listed as ‘probable’ even if it has not been definitively diagnosed.”
And contrary to Bell’s insinuation that fatalities are being deliberately inflated by deaths unrelated to the disease — such as “the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever” — the CDC explicitly advises that COVID-19 not be reported in such cases where the disease didn’t factor into the death.
The CDC emphasizes: “COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.”
Finally, the paper makes no mention of excess deaths. As we’ve previously explained, excess deaths are deaths above the number expected in a given time period. In the context of COVID-19, it can help assess the true impact of the pandemic by capturing direct and indirect effects of the virus. It can account for unreported COVID-19 deaths and for other factors, such as people dying from other causes (say, avoiding medical attention), as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions.
A New York Times analysis of CDC mortality data shows that, from March 2020 to February 2021, deaths nationwide were about 21% higher than what would have been expected during that time period.

208,Social Media Posts Make Baseless Claim on COVID-19 Death Toll,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/social-media-posts-make-baseless-claim-on-covid-19-death-toll/,,"Quick Take
Viral posts wrongly suggest that the COVID-19 death toll is exaggerated because “the state” has instructed that “anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident” be listed as a coronavirus victim. Experts say there is no such default classification — and that the U.S. death count is probably underestimated.


Full Story 
Many experts believe the number of deaths linked to the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is likely higher than the figures available — due to factors such as an insufficient number of tests and inconsistent reporting across locales.
One Facebook user has claimed the opposite, erroneously suggesting the count is being inflated by unrelated deaths, and copies of that claim have gone viral on the social media platform.
The repeatedly shared posts — citing the user’s purported recollection of a woman’s claim on a “live broadcast” — argue that “the state” has instructed “that anyone who didnt die by a gun shot wound or car accident” should be “listed as covid 19 victims.” It claims “the numbers are a lie” and calls for an investigation.
We attempted to contact the user responsible for the original post, to no avail, so we don’t know what “state” was being referenced. But there’s no evidence that any state has adopted a policy to classify all deaths, regardless of the individual circumstances, as being related to COVID-19.
Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, called the allegation “ridiculous.”
“Death certificates are basically federal, and each state has a public health division that answers to the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for death certification,” Aiken, the Spokane County, Washington, medical examiner, told us in an email. “For all practical purposes death certification is directed by the feds, via health departments.”
Contrary to the Facebook posts, Aiken said, “Medical Examiners and Coroners certify hundreds to thousands of deaths each year, using investigation, autopsies, and medical tests as required, and do not choose a ‘default diagnosis’ such as COVID-19.”
Aiken pointed out that CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. The latest guidance was issued April 2. 
“If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the [underlying cause of death], as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),” the guidance says. “In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.”
The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'”
One hypothetical example cited by the CDC is an 86-year-old woman dying after exhibiting symptoms such as a high fever, severe cough, and difficulty breathing, “after being exposed to an ill family member who subsequently was diagnosed with COVID-19.” The CDC says that “probable COVID-19” may be listed as the underlying cause of death — a deduction made “given the patient’s symptoms and exposure to an infected individual.”
There was renewed attention given to the theory of the death toll being inflated after Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said during an April 7 press conference that “if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.”
Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner of New York City and a high-profile pathologist, told Fox News that it’s reasonable to include people with the virus, who also had other health issues, in the count.
“In the normal course, autopsies would then determine whether the person died of the effects of the COVID virus, whether the person had a brain tumor or brain hemorrhage for example that might be unrelated to it and what the relative significance of both the infection and the pre-existing disease is,” he said. Even if the number of autopsies being conducted are low because of concerns of infection, he said, “then you will include in those numbers some people who did have a pre-existing condition that would have caused death anyway, but that’s probably a small number.”
Likewise, Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told us in an email: “There are going to be some people who die of something else, happen to have COVID and get tested, and get counted as COVID deaths but would die anyway. It would be wrong to say that number is zero. However given current testing shortages and protocols, the number of such cases will be small.”
“A greater issue is errors in the other direction — deaths caused by COVID that are not counted as such,” he said.
Lipsitch cited at least two reasons for that underreporting: Someone having and dying from clear COVID-19 respiratory symptoms but never being tested (especially early in the epidemic, when tests were scarce). Or, he said, someone dying from causes, such as a heart attack or stroke, triggered by the infection — with no one ever suspecting or testing for the disease.
This is not an isolated issue: A 2013 study of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. found that lab-confirmed tests accounted for only about 1 in every 7 deaths attributable to the disease.
“So overall it seems likely that while a few individuals who would have died anyway are getting called COVID deaths, there are [many] more deaths caused by COVID that are not being attributed to COVID,” Lipsitch said. And it is “simply not true that anyone who dies of something other than a car accident or gunshot wound is attributed to COVID.”
In New York City, an epicenter for the outbreak with more than 4,000 reported deaths, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had not been counting the many deaths happening at home if the individuals had not been confirmed to have the disease. After a WNYC and Gothamist report on a sharp increase in the number of daily deaths happening at home in the city — and the suspected undercounting of cases — city officials said they would begin to include suspected cases in their counts.
Gary Watts — the coroner for Richland County, South Carolina, and president of the International Association of Coroners & Medical Examiners — also told us that the notion that the numbers of COVID-19 deaths are somehow being inflated didn’t make sense to him.
Watts said in a phone interview if an individual with a pre-existing condition, such as a heart disease or COPD, gets the virus, “COVID-19 is going to be a very detrimental complication to your already existing disease.” Someone could live for years with COPD, for example, then die within weeks after getting COVID-19. In such cases, when the person is confirmed to have the virus, COVID-19 would be listed as a contributing factor.
In terms of known COVID-19 related deaths in hospitals, Watts said hospitals certify deaths and report that information. He said his office is only conducting postmortem tests for COVID-19 in limited cases — if the decedent was healthy, for example, and family indicated he or she had COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Watts said the purpose is to determine the cause of death but also “as a safety precaution for the first responders” who had contact with the individual. But if there was a clear cause of death — say, a stabbing — with no relation to COVID-19, Watts said he would not include the disease, even if the decedent tested positive.
“If it was not related to the cause of death, then I’m not going to list it,” he said.
As of April 8, there have been more than 14,000 COVID-19 related deaths reported in the U.S., according to a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
“The true facts are that COVID-19 deaths will likely be underreported on death certificates and not over-reported,” Aiken said. “This will be especially true as deaths that occur in homes, and not the hospital, mount. Not all jurisdictions are able to test home deaths with typical symptoms for COVID-19.”

Likewise, Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told us in an email: “There are going to be some people who die of something else, happen to have COVID and get tested, and get counted as COVID deaths but would die anyway. Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, called the allegation “ridiculous.”
“Death certificates are basically federal, and each state has a public health division that answers to the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for death certification,” Aiken, the Spokane County, Washington, medical examiner, told us in an email. “For all practical purposes death certification is directed by the feds, via health departments.”
Contrary to the Facebook posts, Aiken said, “Medical Examiners and Coroners certify hundreds to thousands of deaths each year, using investigation, autopsies, and medical tests as required, and do not choose a ‘default diagnosis’ such as COVID-19.”
Aiken pointed out that CDC offers guidance to public health officials on the certification of COVID-19 deaths. “In these cases, COVID-19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it.”
The CDC advises that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definitive diagnosis cannot be made … but it is suspected or likely … it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed. Watts said in a phone interview if an individual with a pre-existing condition, such as a heart disease or COPD, gets the virus, “COVID-19 is going to be a very detrimental complication to your already existing disease.” Someone could live for years with COPD, for example, then die within weeks after getting COVID-19."
209,The White House Spins Trump’s Disinfectant Remarks,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/the-white-house-spins-trumps-disinfectant-remarks/,,"At an April 23 press briefing, President Donald Trump mused about the possibility of using “very powerful light” and injecting disinfectant into the body to kill COVID-19 – a suggestion that, in the case of disinfectant, was roundly criticized by experts as dangerous. A day later, he said he was being “sarcastic.”
There’s no clear indication in his remarks that Trump was joking, either in his initial comment or when he returned to the topic later in the briefing. But we’ll leave it for readers to judge.
The Briefing
At the briefing, William Bryan, who leads the science and technology directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, addressed the media about recent DHS research on how well the coronavirus survives on nonporous surfaces in heat, humidity and sunlight. Bryan said the “virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight” and also talked about the testing of disinfectants that quickly kill the virus on surfaces.
Trump then spoke about the powers of sunlight and disinfectant, turning at times to address Bryan.

Trump, April 23: A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that. So that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful.
Here, Bryan responded to a reporter’s question about injecting a cleaner into the body, and Trump backtracked on his previous speculation about an “injection”:

ABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, April 23: The president mentioned the idea of a cleaner, bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging. There’s no scenario where that could be injected into a person, is there?
Bryan: No, I’m here to talk about the finds that we had in the study. We don’t do that within that lab at our labs.
Trump: It wouldn’t be through injection. We’re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t work. But it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object.
Later in the briefing, Trump suggested applying “light and heat to cure,” and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, responded to Trump’s question by saying she hasn’t heard of heat or light “as a treatment.”

Trump, April 23: I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there’s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. You know — if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can’t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can’t. I’m not a doctor. But I’m like a person that has a good you know what. Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?
Birx: Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as — I’ve not seen heat or light …
Trump: I think it’s a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay?
The Day After the Briefing
The following morning, after numerous press reports cited experts calling the injection or ingestion of disinfectants dangerous, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany issued a statement claiming Trump’s words had been taken “out of context.”
“President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,” McEnany said. “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.”
That morning, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams also issued this warning via Twitter, “A reminder to all Americans- PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/ medication to yourself or a loved one. Your safety is paramount, and doctors and nurses are have years of training to recommend what’s safe and effective.”
Later in the day, Trump claimed his comments the previous day were “sarcastic.”

Reporter, April 24: Can you clarify your comments about injections of disinfectant?
Trump: No, I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you, just to see what would happen.
Now, disinfectant, or doing this, maybe on the hands, would work. And I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday — Bill — because when they say that something will last three or four hours or six hours, but if the sun is out or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday? But I was asking a sarcastic — and a very sarcastic question — to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters. Okay.
Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.
Trump: Uh, no, no, no, no.
Reporter: Were you being sarcastic with them?
Trump: To look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands, but whether or not sun can help us because, I mean, he came in yesterday and he said they’ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn’t where he hasn’t done it. This is where they’ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact, negatively, on this vir– in other words, it does not live well with humidity, and it doesn’t live well with sun — sunlight — heat. It doesn’t live well with heat and sun and disinfectant. And that’s what I brought out. And I thought it was clear. Okay. Anything else?
Although Trump said he told Bryan “to look into whether or not sun and disinfectant on the hands … can help us,” that is not what the video shows. At the briefing, Trump didn’t say anything to Bryan about hands.
Turning to Bryan, Trump said at the briefing, “And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that.”
Again, we didn’t detect any sarcasm – and we aren’t alone in that – but since sarcasm is subjective, we’ll leave it to readers to make up their own minds about the president’s intent.

210,Trump Baselessly Claims Coronavirus Will ‘Go Away’ Without Vaccine,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-baselessly-claims-coronavirus-will-go-away-without-vaccine/,,"At a White House meeting with fellow Republicans, President Donald Trump said, without evidence, that the coronavirus “is going to go away without a vaccine.” While it’s impossible to predict the future, experts say it’s unlikely that the virus will simply go away.
His son Eric went even further in a May 16 interview, claiming that coronavirus “will magically all of a sudden go away” after the November election.
“It is completely fanciful and not evidence-based to state that SARS-CoV-2 will ‘go away’ without a vaccine,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, referring to the full name of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. “There is no basis for this statement.”
“It is a theoretical possibility that the virus could go away permanently with a large uncontrolled epidemic everywhere in the world, leading to depletion of susceptible people and permanent immunity,” Lipsitch added in an email.
But, he said, that series of events would be “exceedingly unlikely,” since no human coronavirus is known to elicit permanent immunity, and because countries will maintain a pool of people susceptible to the virus for a long time, allowing for reintroductions of the virus. 
To state that the virus will go away without a vaccine is “baseless,” Lipsitch said, and to consider it as one of the top scenarios for policy planning is “foolish.”
In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, also objected to Trump’s claim that the virus would “go away” without a vaccine.
“No, this virus isn’t going to go away,” he said. “Hopefully, over time, we’ll learn to live with it and we’ll be able to reduce the risk of transmission. But it’s going to stay as a background problem in the country and around the world until we have a vaccine.”
Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at Harvard, also told us he did not think the virus would go away without a vaccine.
Trump’s comments came during a May 8 meeting at the White House with Republican members of Congress in response to a reporter’s question about how necessary a vaccine is to resolving the pandemic.
Trump, May 8: Well, I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine. It’s going to go away, and it’s — we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time. You may have some — some flare-ups and I guess, you know, I would expect that. Sometime in the fall, you’ll have flare-ups maybe. Maybe not. But according to what a lot of people say, you probably will. We’ll be able to put them out. You may have some flare-ups next year, but eventually, it’s going to be gone. I mean, it’s going to be gone.
You know, there are some viruses and flus that came, and they went for a vaccine, they never found the vaccine, and they’ve disappeared. They’ve never shown up again. They got — they die too, like everything else. They die too.
When asked for evidence for his position in a follow-up question, Trump said he relied “on what doctors say,” adding, “They say it’s going to go — that doesn’t mean this year, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be gone, frankly, by the fall or after the fall. But eventually, it’s going to go away. The question is will we need a vaccine? At some point, it will probably go away by itself. If we had a vaccine, that would be very helpful. I’d be very happy to have a vaccine.”
The White House did not respond to our requests for support for the statement or for clarification on what the president meant by “go away.” But back in February, Trump made a similar claim, suggesting that because of warmer weather, the coronavirus would “go away” in April — a prediction that, as we explained, was highly uncertain even at the time, and did not come to pass. 
And in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on May 16, the president’s son Eric Trump used similar language to make the groundless claim that the coronavirus is a Democratic ploy to keep his father from doing arena-style campaigning. “You watch, they’ll milk it every single day between now and Nov. 3,” the younger Trump said of Democrats. “And guess what? After Nov. 3, coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.”
While the president is right that the pandemic will eventually wane, scientists do not anticipate a speedy retreat — and even with a vaccine, there is a chance the virus will continue to stick around.
“Viruses do not do anything magically,” said Lipsitch. “All scientific evidence and reasoning indicates that SARS-CoV-2 will be spreading in large parts of the human population for months or years to come, in the absence of widespread use of an effective vaccine.”
Virus Unlikely to ‘Disappear’
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a prominent member of the coronavirus task force, has said that it will take a vaccine to allow society to let up on all of its mitigation efforts. 
“It’s not going to be over to the point of our being able to not do any mitigation until we have a scientifically sound, safe and effective vaccine,” he said in an April 16 television interview on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle.”
And Fauci pushed back when host Laura Ingraham suggested, as Trump later did, that this virus might “disappear” the way SARS did.
“Anything could, Laura, but I have to tell you, the degree of efficiency, of transmissibility of this is really unprecedented in anything that I’ve seen,” he said. “It’s an extraordinarily efficient virus in transmitting from one person to another. Those kinds of viruses don’t just disappear.”
In Senate testimony on May 12, Fauci again said of the virus disappearing, “That is just not going to happen,” adding that even if there is better control of the virus in the summer, “it is likely that there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will eventually get back to us.”
Fauci also previously cautioned that while conditions in the U.S. would improve, there could be an ongoing risk. 
“[I]f you want to get to pre-coronavirus, you know, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there,” he said in an April 6 task force briefing. “But I believe, with the therapies that will be coming online, and with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get back to where we are right back now.”
The World Health Organization, too, has said that while a vaccine is humanity’s best chance of getting rid of the virus, even then, there is no guarantee that the virus will go completely away.
“I think it’s important to put this on the table,” said Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, in a May 13 press conference. “This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away.”
“I don’t think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear. We do have one great hope,” Ryan continued. “If we do find a highly effective vaccine that we can distribute to everyone who needs it in the world, we may have a shot at eliminating this virus. But that vaccine will have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone and we will have to use it.”
Ryan noted that the world has failed to eliminate other viral diseases, such as measles, even with readily available, effective vaccines.
“There are no promises in this and there are no dates,” he said, adding that there was a possibility COVID-19 might “settle into a long-term problem.”
COVID-19 Projections
How the COVID-19 pandemic will unfold can’t be known, but some scientists have attempted to model how the virus will spread under different assumptions to understand what the possibilities might be.
Lipsitch was part of a team at Harvard that created a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate regions of the world, factoring in different levels of seasonality, immunity and cross-immunity to two common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1.
Publishing in the journal Science in mid-April, the team found that repeated wintertime outbreaks “will probably occur,” and even if the virus might appear to go away, “a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.”
In many of the team’s simulations, SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate long-term. If immunity to the virus lasts a bit less than a year — on par with the common cold coronaviruses — then the coronavirus might return annually. A longer, two-year period of immunity pushes the virus’s reappearance into a biennial or more sporadic pattern.
In the unlikely case that immunity is permanent, then the virus could disappear for five or more years, the study found. But even in cases in which the virus might seem to die out, SARS-CoV-2 could make a comeback several years later.
These scenarios do not factor in any mitigation measures, but other modeling from the group suggests that one-time lockdowns won’t be enough to control the virus.
“We found that one-time social distancing measures are likely to be insufficient to maintain the incidence of SARS-COV-2 within the limits of critical care capacity in the United States,” said co-author Stephen Kissler, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard, in a press call. “And so what seems could be necessary in the absence of other sorts of treatments are intermittent social distancing periods.”
While the team does not endorse any particular strategy, the basic idea with intermittent social distancing would be to try to space out the number of infections enough so that the health care system never gets overloaded, but that over time, immunity to the virus builds. 
If approximately 50-67% of a given population were to become infected and develop immunity, then that could provide so-called community or herd immunity, preventing spread to those who still remain susceptible — and causing outbreaks to eventually peter out.
This type of slow-build immunity approach is one way that the pandemic could end without a vaccine, Annelies Wilder-Smith, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told us. (The other involves a highly unlikely global containment effort, involving a simultaneous Wuhan-level lockdown in every country.) 
But it would take a long time, she said — perhaps two to four years — and, as we’ve established, would not necessarily bring a true end to the virus.
Work by others also suggests the virus will be around for the long haul. In an April 30 report released by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, researchers outlined three possible scenarios, based on what is known about SARS-CoV-2 and past experience with epidemics.
In the first so-called “peaks and valleys” scenario, the first wave of infection would be followed by a series of well-defined waves that gradually diminish in 2021.
In a second scenario, the virus returns in the fall or winter with a vengeance — akin to what happened with the 1918 influenza pandemic — producing a much larger wave of infections than the current one, followed up by smaller subsequent waves.
In the third “slow burn” scenario, infections would continue at a lower level after the first surge, but wouldn’t follow a clear wave pattern.
Regardless of the scenario the pandemic follows, the report cautions that “we must be prepared for at least another 18 to 24 months of significant COVID-19 activity, with hot spots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas.”
And the report notes that the virus may not go away, even if the pandemic resolves. 
“As the pandemic wanes, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population and will synchronize to a seasonal pattern with diminished severity over time,” similar to what has happened with past pandemic influenza viruses and the more mild human coronaviruses that cause colds.
Past Viruses
Indeed, although Trump suggested that viruses disappear, never to return, without vaccines, that’s not actually what happens in most cases.
“I’m hard pressed to think of any viruses that ‘disappeared’ on their own,” Columbia epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us. “Once they gain a foothold, most viruses are hard to eliminate, especially respiratory viruses. Influenza – flu — doesn’t go away, it just keeps coming back in new guises.”
Far from disappearing, even after all the waves of a pandemic conclude, pandemic influenza viruses return as seasonal influenza viruses. 
“They settle down and evolve, a key surface protein (the hemagglutinin, H) mutating to get past our immune systems,” said Morse, allowing “the new variant to reinfect, even people already immune from having had the pandemic.”
Versions of the H1N1 influenza strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, for example, continue to circulate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the virus led to at least 100 million illnesses and 75,000 deaths between 2009 and 2018 in the U.S. alone — and that is with a vaccine that became available in October 2009 and is estimated to have prevented up to 1.5 million clinical cases.
In fact, Morse said every seasonal flu the world knows is the descendant of a pandemic virus.
The common cold coronaviruses that infect humans today are also examples of viruses that never disappeared. These viruses are thought to have emerged from animals in the past, the most recent one around 1890, according to a genetic analysis of OC43. Although still speculative, the authors of that study think it’s possible that OC43 may have been responsible for the 1889-1890 pandemic when it crossed over into humans from cows. 
These coronaviruses do not mutate to the extent that influenza does, Morse said. But immunity to the viruses is short-lived, so the viruses are able to reinfect people after a period of time and also tend to exhibit a seasonal pattern.
There is the example of the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, virus, which led to an outbreak in 2003 that was successfully contained. Other than a few lingering cases and a couple mishaps in a lab in 2004, the virus has not returned — although there is still the risk the virus could reemerge if humans interact with animals harboring the virus.
But that virus never spread as widely as SARS-CoV-2, infecting only about 8,000 people in fewer than 30 countries. In contrast, as of May 19, there have been more than 4.6 million COVID-19 cases in 188 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker.
SARS-CoV-1, Morse said, was not as transmissible as its successor, and the bulk of the transmission was in health care settings. “Once the affected facilities implemented rigorous infection control,” he said, “they could control SARS in the facility and it eventually stopped.”
What will ultimately happen with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, as the trajectory, Morse said, will depend “on the virus, on how we behave, and on our immune systems.”
But there is little precedent for a virus that has spread so efficiently to “go away,” as the president claimed.
Morse said that long-term, there isn’t enough evidence to know whether the coronavirus will follow the path of a seasonal flu virus — mutating and periodically reinfecting — or that of a seasonal coronavirus, periodically reinfecting after a while, and usually causing a milder disease. 
“Whatever the scenario,” he said, “it’s likely we’ll be dealing with it, and its consequences, for some time to come.”

211,False Claim About CDC’s Global Anti-Pandemic Work,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/false-claim-about-cdcs-global-anti-pandemic-work/,,"As the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus has spread around the world, a number of politicians, news organizations and public figures have made the false claim that the Trump administration cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s anti-pandemic work in over 40 countries to just 10. The CDC told us that’s not true.  
The claim appears to have been based solely on outdated news reports from early 2018 that said the CDC was preparing to dramatically reduce its work helping to prevent infectious-disease epidemics. Those reports said much of that work on the Global Health Security Agenda, a pact between over 60 nations that began in 2014, had been funded by a five-year, nearly $600 million supplemental package that was dwindling. That one-time funding, which Congress originally appropriated in response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, ran out at the end of September 2019.
The director of the CDC’s Center for Global Health did say at the time that, without additional funding, its Division of Global Health Protection “will have to scale its global health security portfolio to focus efforts based on existing resources,” as the Wall Street Journal first reported in January 2018. If that happened, the official said the CDC would shift its focus to just 10 “priority countries” and “plan for the completion of its country-based programs” in 39 other nations, the Journal’s story said. 
Those hypothetical cuts were avoided, however, because Congress later provided more funding for the CDC’s global health programs, the CDC told us in a statement.  
But in remarks from the Senate floor on Feb. 24, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed the Trump administration made “drastic cuts to the global health division at CDC,” before saying, “In 2018, CDC was forced to reduce the number of countries it operated in from 49 to 10.”
Three days later, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut made a similar claim on Twitter — though he used slightly different figures.
“President Obama set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries, as a way to protect against something just like Coronavirus breaking out across the world,” Murphy wrote. “Experts begged Trump to keep them open. He closed 37 of them.”
Murphy’s tweet appeared to catch the attention of Joy Behar, co-host of ABC’s “The View,” who made the same claim on the daytime talk show March 9. 
Murphy’s office did not respond when we asked for a source for his statement, and Schumer’s office told us Schumer relied on a New York Times article that was published the day of his floor remarks. That Times piece was not the only one from a news outlet to state that the cutbacks the CDC warned about in 2018 had actually gone into effect.
As we said, the CDC told us that’s false.
“CDC did not have to cut back its work from 49 to 10 countries,” said Maureen Bartee, CDC’s associate director for Global Health Security, in a statement to FactCheck.org. “In the FY18-FY20 annual appropriations, CDC received base appropriations for global health security from Congress. This was used to continue the essential public health capacity development in the four core areas that was started in 2014 with the one-time supplemental funds.”
Those four core areas, Bartee said, are surveillance, laboratory systems, workforce development and emergency management and response. “Focusing on potential weak links in these core areas ensures that partner countries are better prepared to respond to disease threats, wherever they might begin,” she explained.
CDC operating budget plans show that its funding for global public health protection — which includes global disease detection and emergency response and global public health capacity — increased from $58 million in fiscal year 2017 to around $108 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. (And that does not include any remaining supplemental funds available for use.) The increases included nearly $50 million more each year for CDC’s global health security initiatives. 
Those amounts went up again in fiscal year 2020, when the CDC was awarded $183 million for global public health protection, overall, and $125 million specifically for its global health security efforts. For fiscal year 2021, President Donald Trump has requested that CDC funding for global disease detection and other programs be increased further — to $225 million total, with $175 million going directly to global health security.
With its current funding, Bartee said, the CDC is actually working in “more than 60 countries” — not 10 — to address the threat of global infectious diseases and outbreaks.
Bartee, email to FactCheck.org, March 10: In fiscal year 2020, the U.S. government, including CDC, is working with 19 priority partner countries to build preparedness and capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats at their source. These countries are Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, and Vietnam. In addition to these 19, CDC is supporting global disease detection, emergency and humanitarian response, and other global health protection activities in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Niger, Panama, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.  
Also, CDC is establishing platforms with regional offices to advance global health security and maintain a sustainable global presence. With this regional approach, CDC intends to implement a sustainable, long-term overseas operational structure, expand the reach of its technical assistance and programs, and strengthen disease outbreak response. CDC is currently establishing regional platforms in South America (Brazil), Eastern Europe/Central Asia (Georgia), Middle East/North Africa (Oman), and Southeast Asia (Vietnam). 
Beyond those countries listed here, CDC, along with other U.S. government agencies, continues to support a broad range of global health programs (e.g., HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, global immunization) that address global infectious diseases threats, as well as response to major outbreaks that require international assistance. All told, CDC is currently working in more than 60 countries.
For comparison, in 2017, the CDC said it worked with 17 “Phase 1” countries and another 14 “Phase 2” countries and CARICOM, an organization of 15 Caribbean island nations, on implementation of the Global Health Security Agenda. That’s the same number of countries the CDC said the U.S. originally committed to working with back in 2014.

Three days later, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut made a similar claim on Twitter — though he used slightly different figures."
212,Cattle Vaccine Not Related to 2019 Novel Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/cattle-vaccine-not-related-to-2019-novel-coronavirus/,,"2.7KQuick Take
Viral Facebook posts use a photo of a vaccine for cows to falsely suggest that the novel coronavirus isn’t actually new, alleging it is proof of “how much the media controls people.” The cattle vaccine has nothing to do with the COVID-19 virus.


Full Story 
Users on Facebook are spreading a photo of a vaccine used on cattle to falsely imply that the novel coronavirus infecting humans globally has been known about “for years.”
“Just in case you are wondering how much the media controls people, America has been vaccinating cattle for coronavirus for years,” the posts read, “yet the news tells you it’s new and gunna kill you all so go buy mask….”

That suggestion is false for a few reasons:

Coronavirus is a generic term for a large family of viruses, not any unique strain, in humans and animals. The vaccine pictured, ScourGuard 4K, is a vaccine for “pregnant cows and heifers” to help prevent diarrhea in their calves caused by bovine coronavirus and other microbes. As its name suggests, bovine coronavirus is a virus that infects cattle.
The novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was first publicly reported in late 2019. The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and has since spread internationally — infecting more than 90,000 people to date. More than 3,000 people have died.
Many credible news outlets, citing experts, have actually suggested face masks are not a certain preventative measure for the general public to protect itself from the virus. U.S. government officials have requested Americans not purchase such masks and instead leave them available for health care workers.

Christina Lood, a spokeswoman for Zoetis, the manufacturer for the vaccine in question, told us in an email that “ScourGuard 4KC is licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the vaccination of healthy, pregnant cows and heifers as an aid in preventing diarrhea in their calves caused in part by bovine coronavirus.” (Emphasis Lood’s.)
Lood noted that the bovine coronavirus and the 2019 novel coronavirus, both of which are betacoronaviruses, are from different lineages — and said that “very little cross protection has been demonstrated between” the two subgroups of betacoronavirus.
In other words, there’s little evidence to suggest the vaccine used to protect cattle from the bovine coronavirus would be effective in vaccinating against the novel coronavirus.
The posts could also leave the wrong, and harmful, impression that the cattle vaccine can be used by humans.
“Under no circumstance should people vaccinate themselves with any animal vaccine,” Jeremy Schefers, an assistant professor in the department of veterinary population medicine at the University of Minnesota, said in an email. “It’s dangerous and likely won’t work.”
As we’ve previously explained, there is not yet a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said a vaccine won’t be ready for “a year to a year-and-a-half,” at best.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has said it “does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.” It instead suggests masks be worn by people “who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).”
The CDC has outlined other preventative measures, such as avoiding close contact with those who are sick; avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and washing hands and surfaces regularly.

213,"Japan Continues to Use Vaccines, Not Ivermectin, to Fight COVID-19",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/scicheck-japan-continues-to-use-vaccines-not-ivermectin-to-fight-covid-19/,,"
Japan has made progress in the fight against COVID-19, with more than 70% of the country’s population now vaccinated. Experts say that high vaccination rate, along with the widespread use of masks, is likely behind Japan’s success at getting COVID-19 rates down. Japan reported just 86 daily cases nationwide as of Nov. 1, the lowest since last June and down from more than 20,000 in mid-August.
But conservative radio host Hal Turner falsely reported on his website on Oct. 27 that Japan ended its COVID-19 vaccine program and has instead been treating cases with ivermectin, an antiparasitic medication. Turner’s headline, which was shared on social media posts, falsely claimed, “Japan drops vax rollout, goes to Ivermectin.”
The article on Turner’s website said Japan pulled the Moderna vaccine after finding metal contamination, then switched from vaccines to ivermectin. The post contains links to press reports, none of which back up the claim that the country has ended its vaccination program or switched to ivermectin. One article, from the Associated Press, quotes a virology expert as saying Japan’s success is due in part to the vaccines.
Japan has mainly relied on the mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer, which require two shots, administered a few weeks apart, for full vaccination against COVID-19. In August, Japan also began using the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being administered in two shots, eight weeks apart. A Japanese health ministry panel approved a plan in October to make a booster shot available to everyone who has received two vaccine shots, eight months after the second shot.

So, rather than ending its COVID-19 vaccination program, the Japanese government has said it plans to continue providing vaccines, including the booster shot as soon as December, according to NHK World Japan.
Japan did have an issue with the manufacturing process of the Moderna vaccine. In late August, Moderna and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. suspended and later recalled three lots of the Moderna vaccine that contained about 1.6 million doses after stainless steel contaminants were found in some vials.
Takeda said the problem was caused by “incorrect assembly and was due to human error specific to visually misjudging the required 1mm gap between the star-wheel and the stopper” of machinery that put the tops on vaccine vials, according to an Oct. 1 article by Reuters. Japan continued to administer vaccine doses that were unaffected by the manufacturing issue. 
Ivermectin Never Approved for Treatment
Contrary to Turner’s claim, ivermectin is not on a list of pharmaceuticals approved to treat COVID-19 in Japan. 
“Ivermectin is not endorsed by the Japanese government,” Kosuke Yasukawa, who is a physician at Medstar Washington Hospital Center and an assistant professor of clinical medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, told us in an email.
Haruo Ozaki, chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, had recommended the use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19 patients at Feb. 9 press conference, “which was criticized by many physicians in the U.S.,” said Yasukawa, an infectious disease specialist who received his medical degree at Keio University in Tokyo.
Ozaki is not a government official, and the Tokyo Medical Association is a professional organization that doesn’t make policy.
“I believe basic precautions like masks [and] social distancing, along with vaccination, helped reduce infections in Japan,” Yasukawa said. 
The World Health Organization said in March that evidence about the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 was “inconclusive.”  
The WHO recommends that ivermectin “continue to be used for its intended purposes,” the organization said in an email to FactCheck.org. “Until more data is available, WHO recommends that the drug only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials,” regardless of disease severity.
Similarly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says “currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19.” (For more on ivermectin, see SciCheck’s article “Ongoing Clinical Trials Will Decide Whether (or Not) Ivermectin Is Safe, Effective for COVID-19.”)
Officials from the Japanese Embassy in Washington didn’t return emails seeking comment.

214,Post Misrepresents Details of Postmortem Study of Vaccinated Patient,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/06/scicheck-post-misrepresents-details-of-postmortem-study-of-vaccinated-sars-cov-2-patient/,,"SciCheck Digest
A controversial radio show host and blogger misrepresented findings of a published case report to conclude that an 86-year-old man died as a result of being vaccinated against COVID-19. The case report’s lead author said the man died of bacterial pneumonia and “there was not any sign of vaccination side effect.”

A case report first published online in April was billed to be the “first case of postmortem study in a patient vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2” — the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In the paper, the authors described the patient history of an 86-year-old male nursing home resident who died almost four weeks after he received his first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in early January.
For more than two weeks after vaccination, the man experienced no apparent symptoms but was hospitalized on the 18th day for worsening diarrhea. Seven days after hospitalization, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 — which he is believed to have contracted from his hospital roommate — and he died one day later.
Although the virus was detected in several of his vital organs upon examination, the authors said the man showed no signs of having COVID-19. They concluded the diarrhea had been caused by ischemic colitis, an inflammatory disease in the bowel, and the cause of death was bacterial pneumonia and renal failure.
The authors said the autopsy results “might suggest that the first vaccination induces immunogenicity,” or an immune response, “but not sterile immunity,” which is when the immune system is able to completely stop a virus from causing infection.


But some of the case report’s findings have since been misrepresented in a June 13 post headlined “‘Global Time Bomb’ First case of postmortem study of patient vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; ‘viral RNA found in every organ of the body.'” 
The post — which has more than 8,000 shares on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data — was originally published by Hal Turner, a conservative internet radio talk show host and blogger, who has used white supremacist rhetoric and floated conspiracy theories.
“The vaccine, while triggering an immune response, DID NOT STOP the virus from entering every organ in the body,” he emphasized. “The viral RNA was found in virtually every organ in the body, which means the spike proteins as well.”
Turner, who acknowledged not being a doctor or scientist, said he consulted an infectious disease specialist in New Jersey who told him the autopsy findings indicate that everyone will eventually have adverse effects from being vaccinated, and that either the vaccine does not work or is causing the virus to spread faster in vaccinated people.
“This is a GLOBAL TIMEBOMB,” Turner quoted the unnamed specialist saying.
Later in his post, Turner concluded that the vaccine led to the man’s death.
“If one reads the entire article, the whole story is: Patient was given the vaccine, it got him hospitalized with ulcerative colitis due to blood clots, during his hospitalization he got infected by an asymptomatic hospital room mate, and died 4 days later,” Turner wrote. “My conclusion: the jab drove this elderly man to his end.”
However, in a statement to FactCheck.org, the lead author of the case report said Turner got several facts wrong.

“The conclusions made by Turner based on our case report are absolutely misleading and in particular nearly always completely contradictory to our suggestions,” said Dr. Torsten Hansen, who is with the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital OWL of Bielefeld University, Campus Lippe, in Detmold, Germany.
For starters, Hansen said the patient did not have vaccine-induced “ulcerative colitis due to blood clots,” as Turner claimed.
“The patient did not suffer from ulcerative colitis, but from ischemic colitis,” Hansen explained.
Ischemic colitis occurs when the blood flow to the large intestine is temporarily reduced, causing tissue damage in the colon. In this case, Hansen said the patient had a history of ischemic colitis and suffered from “severe arteriosclerosis,” which restricts blood flow to organs and tissues.
“In specific regions of the bowel such as the left colonic flexure these vessels are particularly susceptible for vessel damage by arteriosclerosis. Subsequently, the respective part of the bowel develops inflammatory disease, called ischemic colitis,” he told us.
“Moreover, in the patient’s history, we found a similar finding of ischemic colitis about 15 years ago (not described in the paper). In addition, we did not detect viral RNA in the tissue probes of the actual endoscopic investigation of the large bowel. Taken together, the ischemic colitis is the cause of the diarrhea and it is not induced by vaccination.”
In a follow-up email, Hansen said there “was not any sign of vaccination side effect” in the organs examined. He further stated that the patient died from bacterial pneumonia and that he and his coauthors “believe that there was not any significant viral effect.”
“Our patient, though being positive for SARS CoV2 did not die from COVID19,” he said, noting that Turner’s post incorrectly used the term COVID-19 to refer to both the virus and the disease. “We suggest immune response due to vaccination was able to prevent COVID19.”
Hansen made three other points:

He said Turner “completely ignored” that the patient only received his first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and “it is well known that immunogenicity against SARS CoV2 is fully established not before two weeks after the second vaccination.”
He said it is “simply wrong” that viral RNA was “found in every organ” of the patient’s body, as Turner’s post said multiple times. Hansen and his coauthors only analyzed nine organs known as pathways for viral spreading and detected virus in seven of them.


Finally, Hansen said the results of the autopsy case study have to be interpreted carefully because the case report is about a single patient — which makes it difficult to draw general conclusions about the vaccines. 

When notified that Hansen called Turner’s post a distortion of the case report, Turner — whose post conceded he “might be wrong” — stood by his own analysis.
“My story about ‘Global Time Bomb’ did not ‘distort’ anything,” he told us in an email. “My report came from the lead author’s report and my story provided a direct link to the full text for anyone to view themselves.”
Indeed, anyone who takes the time to read the complete case report of the patient history will likely notice its authors do not reach the same conclusions as Turner.

215,Trump Falsely Claims He Inherited ‘Empty’ Stockpile,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-falsely-claims-he-inherited-empty-stockpile/,,"More than once, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies he inherited from his predecessor was an “empty shelf.”
While the government does not publicize all of the contents of the repository, at the time Trump took office, the Strategic National Stockpile, as it is formally known, reportedly contained vast amounts of materials that state and local health officials could use during an emergency, including vaccines, antiviral drugs, ventilators and protective gear for doctors and nurses.
“The SNS was definitely not an empty shell,” Dr. Tara O’Toole, a former homeland security official during the Obama administration who is now executive vice president at the nonprofit strategic investment firm In-Q-Tel, told us in an email.
At least three times in the past week, however, Trump has sought to blame former President Barack Obama’s administration for the current state of the stockpile, which has been unable to meet the demand for additional supplies expected to be needed to treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or to protect the doctors and nurses caring for those patients. 
During a White House coronavirus task force briefing on March 26, in which Trump mentioned the number of respirators, face shields and ventilators that had so far been distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the president said: “We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place, in a lot of ways.”
When a reporter asked him about that claim during another briefing the following day, Trump again said he inherited “an empty shelf” that he had to refill. 
And he continued to use that inaccurate description on March 30, during an interview with the hosts of “Fox & Friends.” “We started off with an empty shelf,” he said, adding, “We didn’t have very much in terms of medical product … and we built something really good.”
Strategic National Stockpile
The Strategic National Stockpile was created in 1999, and, as of April 2, was described on a Department of Health and Human Services website as “the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.”
(That description was later altered to say, “The Strategic National Stockpile’s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies.” The change was made after Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, said on April 2: “The notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be states’ stockpiles that they then use.” Some interpreted Kushner’s remarks to mean the federal stockpile was not meant to be used by states, which would be false. But, in context, Kushner said the federal government is trying to “make informed data-driven decisions, both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get, to make sure it’s going to the people who need them.”)
Most of the materials in the stockpile are stored in large warehouses around the country, and where those warehouses are located, and exactly what’s in them, is not publicly disclosed.
But NPR science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce was allowed to visit one facility in June 2016 — only months before Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. In her article about the warehouse she toured, she described the shelves as being the opposite of bare.
“A big American flag hangs from the ceiling, and shelves packed with stuff stand so tall that looking up makes me dizzy,” Greenfieldboyce wrote.
She continued:
Greenfieldboyce, for NPR, June 26, 2016: The Strategic National Stockpile got its start back in 1999, with a budget of about $50 million. Since then, even though the details aren’t public, it’s clear that it has amassed an incredible array of countermeasures against possible security threats.
The inventory includes millions of doses of vaccines against bioterrorism agents like smallpox, antivirals in case of a deadly flu pandemic, medicines used to treat radiation sickness and burns, chemical agent antidotes, wound care supplies, IV fluids and antibiotics.
I notice that one section of the warehouse is caged off and locked. Shirley Mabry, the logistics chief for the stockpile, says that’s for medicines like painkillers that could be addictive, “so that there’s no pilferage of those items.”
As we walk, I hear a loud hum. It’s a giant freezer packed with products that have to be kept cold.
Just outside it, there are rows upon rows of ventilators that could keep sick or injured people breathing. Mabry explains that they’re kept in a constant state of readiness. “If you look down to the side you’ll see there’s electrical outlets so they can be charged once a month,” she says. Not only that—the ventilators get sent out for yearly maintenance.
In fact, everything here has to be inventoried once a year, and expiration dates have to be checked. Just tending to this vast stash costs a bundle — the stockpile program’s budget is more than half a billion dollars a year.
And that was the scene at just one of the repositories where the medicine and supplies are housed. As of 2016, there were at least six warehouses holding “approximately $7 billion in products across more than 900 separate line items,” according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
VICE News reported on March 17 that its film crew was also allowed inside one of the facilities for an episode of “VICE News Tonight” that aired in December 2016.  
“[A]lthough we couldn’t reveal where it was or what exactly it had inside. It looked like a prepper’s Ikea, with row after row of containers filled with mystery medications and equipment — including that one item everyone’s been talking about lately, ventilators,” Vice News said.
In her story, Greenfieldboyce also quoted an official with a consulting firm the government had recently hired to analyze how well the stockpile could respond to a range of threats.
Rocco Casagrande, the managing director of Gryphon Scientific, told her that he couldn’t publicly discuss the results of the analysis. But, she wrote, he did say “that across the variety of threats that we examined, the Strategic National Stockpile has the adequate amount of materials in it and by and large the right type of thing.”
That doesn’t sound to us like empty shelves, either.
O’Toole, who also chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, did tell us in an interview that “the SNS mission has expanded” over the years and “one could argue resources did not expand commensurately.”
But the idea that the stockpile should be able to provide all of the supplies needed during a pandemic is misguided, she said.
“It was never, never, never intended to be the full answer to any disaster,” she explained. “It was intended to bridge from the moment of crisis until a little while after when the private sector would be able to gear up and use the whole global supply chain to deliver what was needed.”
Some Supplies Not Fully Restocked
It’s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama’s presidency.
For example, the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not “significantly restored” after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. Medical personnel wear the respirators because they can “filter out at least 95% of airborne particles,” according to the Food and Drug Administration.
Greg Burel, who was the director of the Strategic National Stockpile for more than 12 years until he retired in January, recently told CBS News: “We didn’t receive funds to replace those masks, protective gear and the anti-virals that we used for H1N1.” 
He told Vice News that he decided to use the program’s limited funding to instead purchase vaccines, flu medications and other pharmaceuticals.
“We had to trade off those funds that we had, and we chose to invest in those lifesaving drugs that would not be available from any other source, in the quantity needed, and in time. I definitely want to see my healthcare workers protected; that’s very important. But if I’m thinking, ‘Do I buy this many masks to protect this many workers, or do I buy this many medicines to keep people safe that we can’t get elsewhere?’ there’s no easy answer here,” Burel said.
In other cases, the Obama administration’s attempts to add more equipment, such as ventilators, to the stockpile were not successful.
As the New York Times reported earlier this week:
New York Times, March 29: Thirteen years ago, a group of U.S. public health officials came up with a plan to address what they regarded as one of the medical system’s crucial vulnerabilities: a shortage of ventilators.
The breathing-assistance machines tended to be bulky, expensive and limited in number. The plan was to build a large fleet of inexpensive portable devices to deploy in a flu pandemic or another crisis.
Money was budgeted. A federal contract was signed. Work got underway.
And then things suddenly veered off course. A multibillion-dollar maker of medical devices bought the small California company that had been hired to design the new machines. The project ultimately produced zero ventilators.
That failure delayed the development of an affordable ventilator by at least half a decade, depriving hospitals, states and the federal government of the ability to stock up. The federal government started over with another company in 2014, whose ventilator was approved only last year and whose products have not yet been delivered.
On CNN’s “State of the Union” on March 15, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that there were 12,700 ventilators in the stockpile. At the time, there were 3,487 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As of April 2, there were 239,279 reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. In a task force press briefing that same day, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk said that the U.S. has delivered more than 7,600 ventilators to the states, and still has some in reserve.
Still, O’Toole said she wishes there was less of a focus on expanding the stockpile because it will never be enough and will always lack something that is needed.
“You can’t stockpile your way out of a pandemic like this,” she emphasized.
One of the reasons for the current supply shortage, she said: “We’ve allowed our own national capacity to manufacture things to degrade and in some places go away. And we’ve done that for cost-efficiency sake.”
She later added: “What we need is not a big stockpile. We need a new strategy. We need to use the technologies we have now to create the capacity to respond to something in close to real-time.”
That means being able to “rapidly design and manufacture what we need, when we need it, and the quantities demanded,” she said.",D'Angelo Gore,2020-04-03 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"But, in context, Kushner said the federal government is trying to “make informed data-driven decisions, both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get, to make sure it’s going to the people who need them.”)
Most of the materials in the stockpile are stored in large warehouses around the country, and where those warehouses are located, and exactly what’s in them, is not publicly disclosed. More than once, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that the federal stockpile of emergency medicine and supplies he inherited from his predecessor was an “empty shelf.”
While the government does not publicize all of the contents of the repository, at the time Trump took office, the Strategic National Stockpile, as it is formally known, reportedly contained vast amounts of materials that state and local health officials could use during an emergency, including vaccines, antiviral drugs, ventilators and protective gear for doctors and nurses. O’Toole, who also chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, did tell us in an interview that “the SNS mission has expanded” over the years and “one could argue resources did not expand commensurately.”
But the idea that the stockpile should be able to provide all of the supplies needed during a pandemic is misguided, she said. At least three times in the past week, however, Trump has sought to blame former President Barack Obama’s administration for the current state of the stockpile, which has been unable to meet the demand for additional supplies expected to be needed to treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or to protect the doctors and nurses caring for those patients. Greg Burel, who was the director of the Strategic National Stockpile for more than 12 years until he retired in January, recently told CBS News: “We didn’t receive funds to replace those masks, protective gear and the anti-virals that we used for H1N1.” 
He told Vice News that he decided to use the program’s limited funding to instead purchase vaccines, flu medications and other pharmaceuticals."
216,Report Resurrects Baseless Claim that Coronavirus Was Bioengineered,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/report-resurrects-baseless-claim-that-coronavirus-was-bioengineered/,,"Quick Take
A paper that has not been peer-reviewed reaches faulty conclusions to advance the unsubstantiated claim that the novel coronavirus was bioengineered in a Chinese lab, according to immunology and microbiology experts. The paper’s claims were amplified by Fox News, anyway.

Full Story 
A long-circulating, unsubstantiated claim about the origins of the novel coronavirus resurfaced in recent days after a paper published online purported that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab.
The baseless claim — which we first addressed in the early days of the pandemic — was further amplified when Fox News host Tucker Carlson featured an interview with one of the authors of the paper on his show on Sept. 15.
That segment was viewed on YouTube nearly 2 million times and that link alone was shared by more nearly 50,000 users on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data, where other popular posts also repeated the allegations.
But experts say the new paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, does not prove that the virus was created in a lab.
The paper was uploaded to an open-access website Sept. 14 and was published by the “Rule of Law Society & Rule of Law Foundation” — two related entities in New York tied to Steve Bannon, a former adviser to President Donald Trump. Bannon is listed as the chair of the Rule of Law Society in a registration document filed last year with the state.
The organizations are connected to a partnership forged by Bannon and Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman, that has been described as being based on their shared disdain for the Chinese government. Guo is wanted in China on charges of bribery and fraud — allegations he has denied — according to the New York Times. Bannon announced in November 2018 that Guo would be setting up a $100 million “Rule of Law fund” in part to aid Chinese dissidents and their families.
Guo’s work in the U.S., including consulting services from Bannon, has drawn the interest of federal investigators, the Wall Street Journal has reported.
The new paper attempts to make the case that the novel coronavirus couldn’t have come from nature and instead may have been created by altering a previously discovered bat coronavirus. But several of its main points rest on faulty conclusions.
One of the study’s main claims is that the “genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is suspiciously similar to that of a bat coronavirus discovered by military laboratories” in China and therefore indicates that another coronavirus was used to create the novel coronavirus.


Kristian G. Andersen, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research who has studied the origins of the virus, said of the claim on Twitter: “This simply can’t be true – there are more than 3,500 nucleotide differences between SARS-CoV-2 and these viruses.”
And Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa who studies coronaviruses, told us in an email that the coronavirus referenced — ZC45 — is “only 89% related to SARS-CoV-2. In virology terms, that is very distant.”
Perlman said it would be nearly impossible to make the reverse genetics system needed to manipulate the virus and “changing its sequence to arrive at SARS-CoV-2 would be virtually impossible since it would not be known how to manipulate the virus.”
Nevertheless, Dr. Li-Meng Yan — one of the authors of the new paper and a virologist who has claimed she fled China to reveal the truth about COVID-19 — doubled down on Carlson’s show. She alleged a cover-up by the Chinese government and the scientific community.
Yan, Sept. 15: This virus, COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 virus, actually is not from nature. It is a man-made virus created in the lab based on the China military discovered and owned the very unique bat coronavirus, which cannot affect people, but after the modification become a very harmful virus at now. So, I have evidence to show why they can do it, what they have done, how did they do it.
The paper goes on to suggest that “SARS-CoV-2 contains a unique furin-cleavage site in its Spike protein” — which is “completely absent in this particular class of coronaviruses found in nature” — and that, therefore, the virus was engineered.
Susan R. Weiss, a University of Pennsylvania professor of microbiology who researches coronaviruses, told us in an email that that “makes no sense in terms of what we know about” coronaviruses.
“Among murine coronavirus strains there are viruses with the furin site and strains without — closely related strains closer than SARS-1 and SARS-2 yet they are all virulent,” Weiss said. “So this observation says nothing to me about the virus being engineered.”
A furin site is a short protein sequence that can be recognized and cut by other proteins.
Perlman also said “furin sites are found in many coronaviruses and finding it does not surprise us in the field.”
The paper also argues a conspiracy is afoot by claiming that scientific journals won’t publish the “alternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory.”
“I don’t believe that,” Weiss said. “It is just that the data is not compelling. I don’t know any CoV researchers that believe this at all. There is no way anyone could figure out how to make a virus behave like SARS-2 – asymptomatic spread for [one] thing.”
In March, Andersen and other scientists concluded in an article in Nature Medicine that the novel coronavirus “is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” The authors said that the virus likely originated in one of two ways: “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” meaning before the spread of disease from animals to humans, or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.”
The Nature Medicine article did say it couldn’t rule out an accidental laboratory release of the naturally occurring virus, but its authors said they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”
The new, dubious paper attempts to discredit those findings by saying the Nature Medicine study’s authors “show signs of conflict of interests, raising further concerns on the credibility of this publication.”
The supposed support for that allegation: that one of the authors, Columbia University’s Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, received an award from China for his work on public health there following the 2003 outbreak of the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
The new paper also references the curriculum vitae of another author — Edward C. Holmes, a researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia — which shows that he has collaborated with scientists and organizations in China.
“[D]espite the online lies and malicious editing of my Wikipedia page, I have never received any funds from China, personal or research, and have no grants with Chinese scientists. I do have some honorary appointments there and a nice certificate though,” Holmes wrote on Twitter. “I do work closely with some Chinese scientists and as that directly led to the first release of the genome sequence that might just perhaps possibly be argued to be a good thing.”
Andersen also said that the allegation about the authors being “conflicted” was wrong. “[M]y lab has never received funding from China and we have no collaborations with Chinese investigators. I have no financial interests in China,” he said in a tweet. “All our analyses are scientific and unbiased.”
It’s worth noting that collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and China aren’t uncommon. A recent study published in Higher Education found that U.S. research output between 2014 and 2018 would have dropped without Chinese partnerships — while China’s output would have grown regardless of work with the U.S. “[T]he findings demonstrate that the USA has more to lose than gain in cutting ties with China,” its authors wrote.
Public health officials have also suggested the virus originated in bats.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said: “The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.”
And in April, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement that the “Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.” The intelligence community, it said, “will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic in a May interview, “If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated.”
“Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” Fauci said.

Update, Sept. 28: Experts have since published more thorough reviews of Yan’s paper. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security concluded that the paper “presents a theory about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 but offers contradictory and inaccurate information that does not support their argument.” 


And in a review published by the MIT Press’ “Rapid Reviews COVID-19,” researchers from IBM and the University of Michigan found that the paper “does not demonstrate sufficient scientific evidence to support its claims” and that its “[c]laims are at times baseless and are not supported by the data and methods used.” 
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for “more investigation” to determine how the pandemic began. “Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,” they wrote. “Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.”

217,"Trump, Pence and Reassessing Coronavirus",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trump-pence-and-reassessing-coronavirus/,,"In a little more than a month, President Donald Trump’s language about the coronavirus has shifted, from talk of 15 cases that “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero” to warning of as many as 2.2 million deaths in the country if no social distancing efforts were undertaken. 
At times, the president has acknowledged he changed his assessment of the pandemic, but in other cases, he and Vice President Mike Pence have tried to revise history, ignoring or recasting his previous statements.
Here, we outline Trump’s evolving language on the deadliness of the virus, its spread in the U.S. and how it compares with the seasonal flu. We also provide a timeline of the president’s comments below.
The Threat of the Coronavirus
In an interview on CNN on April 1, Pence said, “I don’t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus.”
That may be what the vice president believes. But he is wrong. The truth is that Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus.
From Jan. 22 to March 10, as we reported before, Trump made a series of statements minimizing the danger posed to the United States. (See our timeline below.)
On March 16, Trump reversed course, imposing social distancing guidelines for 15 days. The following day, he said at a press conference: “This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” 
But he soon sounded a different tone again.
As recently as March 24 at a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump likened the disease’s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents. At the time the president was considering, for economic reasons, whether to relax the social distancing guidelines he had imposed to combat the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Trump, March 24: I brought some numbers here, we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, “Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.” We have to get back to work.
He suggested he might ease the social distancing guidelines. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” he said.
On March 29, the president abandoned that aspiration and announced the guidelines would remain in place until April 30.
In the CNN interview, Pence maintained that the president had been aware throughout of the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak. Confronted by anchor Wolf Blitzer with statements by Trump minimizing the danger, Pence replied, “The president is an optimistic person. We’ve been from the very beginning, when the president suspended all travel from China and stood up the White House coronavirus task force in January, we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst, and that’s been being worked out every single day.”
(The vice president is wrong to claim that “the president suspended all travel from China” from “the very beginning.” As we have written, the administration did not suspend “all travel.” There were exceptions, including for Americans and their family members, to the travel policy announced on Jan. 31.)
‘Under Control’
In a coronavirus task force press briefing on March 15, Trump praised the task force members standing behind him, saying they have been “working around the clock” and were “doing an incredible job.” Then, he added, “This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.”
The next day, when asked about that statement, Trump attempted to reframe his past comments about the U.S. having the coronavirus “under control.”
“Well, when I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with,” Trump said. “If you’re talking about the virus, no, that’s not under control for any place in the world.”
At times, Trump has been clear that he meant the federal government’s response to the pandemic is “under control,” such as on Feb. 29 when talking about a “natural reflex” among Democrats to criticize his actions.
“And we’ve done a great job,” Trump said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “And I’ve gotten to know these professionals. They’re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they’re very, very cool. They’ve done it, and they’ve done it well. Everything is really under control. But when they put a mic in front of a Democrat, and the Democrat said — doesn’t even know what’s going on. ‘How is Trump doing?’ ‘He’s doing a terrible job.’ Well, sadly, I’d probably say the same about them.”
At other times, however, Trump’s “under control” comments appear to be about the coronavirus itself. For example, on Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.”
Or on Feb. 26, when Trump said, “It’s going to be very well under control. Now, it may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We’ll see what happens. But regardless of what happens, we are totally prepared.”
Or on Feb. 25 when he said at a business roundtable in India, “If you go back six months or three months ago, nobody would have ever predicted. But let’s see, I think it’s going to be under control. And I think I can speak for our country, for — our country is under control.”
That same day during a press conference in India, Trump said: “You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it.”
Moving the Goal Posts on the Outbreak
The Trump administration has moved the goal posts dramatically when it comes to estimates of how many Americans will contract COVID-19.
For weeks, as he downplayed the disease’s danger, Trump said there were just a small number of cases in the U.S. and that the disease would vanish. By the end of March, he was saying that without dramatic action like social distancing, as many as 2.2 million Americans could die.
On Feb. 10, when he suggested the disease would go away “in April with the heat — as the heat comes in,” Trump said, “We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.” (See our item “Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?“)
On Feb. 26, the president said, “As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time.”  That same day, he also said, “And again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”
Trump was still downplaying the scope of the problem on March 4, when he said, “[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country.”
But by the end of the month, Trump was painting a stark picture of the disease’s potential toll. On March 29, when he announced he was extending social distancing guidelines until the end of April, he said as many as 2.2 million Americans could die of COVID-19 if the country failed to take decisive action.
He said, “So you’re talking about 2.2. million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that.”
At a White House briefing on March 31, federal health officials raised the upper limit of those who might die from the disease even with mitigation efforts to 240,000.
Trump’s Flu Comparisons
Several times, Trump had compared the coronavirus outbreak to the seasonal flu, but in the March 29 task force briefing, Trump acknowledged that he had changed his mind about this.
“But there were a lot of people that said — I thought about it. I said, ‘Maybe we should ride it through.’ You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We’re in the midst of a bad flu season, Trump said. “But this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it.”
Two days later, he repeated those remarks, but said the flu comparison came from “many friends” and “a lot of people.”
“I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense, they said, ‘Why don’t we ride it out?’ A lot of people have said, a lot of people have thought about it, ‘Ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu.’ But it’s not the flu,” Trump said.
That’s a marked difference from his earlier comments comparing COVID-19 to the flu. For example, in the March 24 virtual town hall, Trump said, “And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off.”
And in a March 9 tweet, he said deaths from the flu average “between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”
In a Feb. 26 press conference, Trump made some confusing remarks that wrongly suggested the fatality rate for the flu is “much higher” than the rate for COVID-19, as we wrote. So far, the worldwide fatality rate for COVID-19 has been higher, but, as we have explained, the rate may end up falling as more is known about the actual number of cases. 
As for the seasonal flu, or influenza, it does kill thousands of Americans each year, and infects millions. For the 2019-2020 flu season, 39 million to 55 million people had flu illnesses in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC estimates this season’s flu had caused between 24,000 and 63,000 deaths. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death.
Trump also has made comparisons between the coronavirus pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, but as we’ve written, the two viruses are very different. Peter Jay Hotez, a professor and dean of the tropical medicine school at Baylor College of Medicine, told us that the novel coronavirus, which is known as SARS-CoV-2, is considerably more transmissible and more lethal than the H1N1 influenza virus. “The urgency to contain this coronavirus is so much greater than the H1N1 2009 one was,” he said.
Timeline of Trump’s Comments
Here is a timeline of statements the president has made about the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, beginning two days after the first case in the country was confirmed:

218,Idaho Doctor Makes Baseless Claims About Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-idaho-doctor-makes-baseless-claims-about-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines/,,"SciCheck Digest
A viral video features a doctor making dubious claims about COVID-19 vaccines and treatments at a forum hosted by Idaho’s lieutenant governor. Dr. Ryan Cole claims mRNA vaccines cause cancer and autoimmune diseases, but the lead author of the paper on which Cole based that claim told us there is no evidence mRNA vaccines cause those ailments.

Update, Aug. 27: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older.
More than 565,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., but two effective mRNA vaccines are now available. Some treatments for certain patients, such as those hospitalized or receiving oxygen, have also been approved or authorized by federal agencies, and they continue to be studied.
Since the pandemic began, however, politicized social media posts have featured doctors, some looking authoritative in white coats, spreading dubious claims about both vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. The most recent example in this misinformation niche is Dr. Ryan Cole, who owns a medical lab in Idaho.
Cole is featured in a video that has amassed more than a million views. He makes a variety of claims, some of which we’ve addressed before.
The video was recorded while he spoke at a forum on March 4 hosted by Idaho’s lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, a Republican, and it was posted by a Libertarian organization called the Idaho Freedom Foundation.
McGeachin was featured in an October post by that group, posing with a Bible and a gun in a video that advocated against public health measures related to the pandemic and asked viewers to sign a statement saying that “any order issued in the future will be ignored.”
Cole said in an interview with FactCheck.org that he’s “not affiliated with any political party, group or organization.” According to the Idaho Secretary of State’s office, Cole is registered as a Republican.
In the March 4 video, Cole makes claims suggesting that federal agencies have acted nefariously, as well as claims that undermine vaccines and promise miracle treatments.
We’ll address his four main claims.

Although there is no evidence to support this, Cole suggested that some of the COVID-19 vaccines could cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.
Again, without evidence, Cole suggested that the federal government withheld a treatment for COVID-19 in order to “vend” a vaccine.
Studies haven’t proved that ivermectin is effective in treating COVID-19, but Cole claimed that federal agencies “have suppressed this life-saving medication.”
Cole said public health officials should encourage people to take vitamin D supplements rather than wear masks or stay physically distant from others.

Vaccine Safety
Two of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to train recipients’ immune systems to make antibodies that fight the virus that causes COVID-19. (See SciCheck’s articles on those vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine“ and “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
These are the first vaccines using mRNA technology authorized in the U.S., but scientists have been developing and testing mRNA vaccines for years, including in people during clinical trials. Still, misinformation exploiting fears of this new technology has been common online.
To those bogus claims, Cole has now added: “mRNA trials in mammals have led to odd cancers. mRNA trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases — not right away, six, nine, 12 months later.”
We asked Cole to provide support for those claims, and he referred us to a 2018 paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery that reviewed trials and studies of various, earlier mRNA vaccines.
But that paper doesn’t support his statement.
Norbert Pardi, a research assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, was the lead author of the paper. He told us in an email, “No publications demonstrate that mRNA vaccines cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.”
Pardi’s 19-page paper does make one passing reference to autoimmune diseases, which is what Cole highlighted to us.
The paper says: “A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.”
But, Pardi explained, he and the other researchers included that passage because they wanted to note some potential concerns. However, he emphasized that “no scientific evidence has confirmed that these concerns are real.”
It’s also worth noting that the paper predated the COVID-19 pandemic by two years, so it doesn’t include any information specifically about the COVID-19 vaccines.
Simply put, “there is no scientific evidence that shows that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune diseases,” Pardi said. “Multiple clinical trials have been performed with mRNA vaccines in the past 10 years and none of them found that mRNA vaccination caused autoimmune diseases. Further, we are not aware of any studies showing an autoimmune disease appearing many months after vaccination as Dr. Cole inaccurately suggests.”
Likewise, Dr. Roger Shapiro, associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email that he was unaware of any study that would support Cole’s claim that the vaccines are carcinogenic.
“There is nothing in the science of mRNA vaccines that would suggest carcinogenicity, and they have been tested in humans for other diseases before COVID-19,” Shapiro said. “mRNA rapidly breaks down in the body, and probably does not last long enough to act as a carcinogen.”
“Regarding autoimmunity,” he said, “this is always a concern with any medical product, but there is no evidence to date suggesting it, and it does not seem any more likely than with other vaccines. mRNA is made all the time in our bodies, and delivering it by vaccine should not be different.”
Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, concurred with the other experts with whom we spoke. In a phone interview, he characterized Cole’s claims about cancer as “fearmongering” and said, “There’s just no scientific basis for that.”
“We’re talking about these very small fragments of messenger RNA that don’t hang around for long at all,” he said, noting that the mRNA vaccines have been in use for almost six months and have been “very safe, very well-tolerated vaccines.”
Winslow recognized that some people are concerned that the mRNA from the vaccine might persist in their bodies and somehow change their genetics or cause long-term effects. So he emphasized that the vaccines have small fragments of RNA, which survive only briefly and carry information about the virus that causes COVID-19.
Similarly, Pardi told us, “COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not alter our DNA and they get rapidly degraded so they do not promote cancer formation.”
Treatments, Vaccines Can Both Be Approved
Cole also suggested in the video that the federal government had suppressed a treatment for COVID-19 in order to “vend” a vaccine. (We’ll address his claims about the supposed treatment in the next section.)
“If there’s a treatment for a disease, the federal government cannot approve a vaccine by law, by rule,” Cole falsely claimed, suggesting that federal agencies were withholding access to a treatment for COVID-19 so that they could instead profit from vaccines.
“So, the NIH, who, you know, is involved in approving medications, they co-hold the patent on the ‘vaccine’ with Moderna,” Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health, an agency that does not approve medications. “If the fox is not guarding the henhouse there, I don’t know who is. That also is insanity to have the government in bed with a private company vending a product that they want to give to everybody.”
There are several problems with this statement.
First, there is no law barring vaccines if treatments are available for a given disease, said Jorge Contreras, a professor in the College of Law at the University of Utah who specializes in intellectual property and genetics and the law. He asked, “Why would there be such a law?”
Clearly there isn’t, Contreras pointed out, since the Food and Drug Administration authorizes a flu vaccine every year while Tamiflu, an antiviral drug used to treat the flu, has been available since the FDA approved it in 1999.
“It’s certainly true that many diseases that we vaccinate for, there is no known cure for,” he said, noting that this is often the case with viral diseases, which are hard to treat.
“But that’s not a legal requirement. That’s a scientific reality,” he said.
As for Cole’s claim about the NIH, that agency conducts and funds research. It doesn’t approve drugs, medical devices or vaccines — that’s a function of the FDA.
The NIH did collaborate with Moderna on the development of its COVID-19 vaccine. As we’ve explained, government researchers had previously been working with scientists at Moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. The team was able to apply that knowledge to design a COVID-19 vaccine.
Since the NIH does research, it also files and receives patents, many of which it licenses to pharmaceutical companies. So, Contreras said, NIH’s patents stemming from research on mRNA vaccines are to be expected, and use of those patents by pharmaceutical companies is also to be expected. Similarly, scientists from government-funded labs sometimes share credit on patents with scientists from privately funded labs. That’s normal, too, Contreras said.
Generally, he explained, there are two reasons that the NIH licenses its patents to companies. First, the NIH is a taxpayer-funded institution, and it can recoup some of its investment in research by lending out the use of its discoveries. Second, the clinical trials required to bring a drug or vaccine to market are risky and expensive, so, theoretically, making its discoveries available to companies can encourage the private sector to take the risk and create products.
So, Cole mischaracterizes the relationship between the NIH and the vaccine manufacturers when he says that it’s a “conflict of interest” to have the “federal government in bed with a vaccine company.”
It’s actually normal to have pharmaceutical companies use government-owned patents.
And he’s wrong when he says of federal agencies, “they don’t want a therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine.”
There’s nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for COVID-19.
Not Enough Data on Ivermectin
Neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin — a common anti-parasitic medication — in the treatment of COVID-19.
Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin, has similarly noted that there is “[n]o scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.”
But Cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is a “treatment” for COVID-19.
He suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines, as we explained above.
“We’re in farm country, horse country — you know, you give it to your dogs, your cats, your horses,” Cole said in the video, addressing an audience in Idaho.
Ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals, but crossover use in humans can be dangerous. While Cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug, not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine, the FDA has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for COVID-19 has grown.
Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, but the FDA hasn’t approved it to treat any viral infections. It is being studied with regard to COVID-19, though, according to both the WHO and NIH.
“Treating COVID-19 with Ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials, but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use,” said Shapiro, the Harvard professor. “My understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems.”
The trials so far have “showed no benefit or worsening disease, some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance, and some did show a possible mortality benefit; but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases,” he said.
Winslow, from Stanford, cautioned that “there have been many claims for miracle cures” over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating COVID-19.
“Ivermectin truly is a wonder drug for parasitic diseases,” he said, “but my suspicion is that it will be a lot like hydroxychloroquine.”
Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19, although studies found that it wasn’t an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients, as we’ve explained before.
The problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are promoted as having broad-spectrum antiviral properties, is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells, Winslow said.
Even potent versions, like remdesivir, which Winslow referred to as the “gold standard” of specific antiviral therapy in COVID-19 treatments, only accelerates the time to recovery, but doesn’t significantly reduce death rates or mortality from COVID-19. Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19; the approval is for patients requiring hospitalization.
So, Cole’s claim that “there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in Washington who have suppressed this life-saving medication,” is unfounded. Ivermectin hasn’t been proved to be effective.
Overstating Effect of Vitamin D
Another of the major points that Cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin D could have in fighting COVID-19.
“If you do not supplement with vitamin D in the wintertime, you are immune suppressed. Most insurance companies in Idaho and northern states do not pay for a vitamin D test, unfortunately,” said Cole, whose lab offers several vitamin D tests.
After eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, Cole said, “What should public health message number one, two, and three be? Vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D.”
It’s true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system. But that doesn’t mean it’s a panacea for COVID-19, as we’ve explained before.
While a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit COVID-19 patients, as we’ve written. Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent.
A recent article from NPR looked at the research on vitamin D with respect to COVID-19 over the last year and found, essentially, the same thing. It also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or with becoming seriously ill.
“While these studies raised hopes among some researchers, others are skeptical, noting that most of these are observational studies, not the gold-standard randomized, controlled trials,” the story said.
“Much of the available evidence only shows association — not causation — and even those results are mixed,” Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told NPR.
In September, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Instagram Live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin D, “I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.” But, as we wrote before, excessive doses should not be used.

219,Meme Misrepresents Fauci’s Position on Vaccine Trials,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/meme-misrepresents-faucis-position-on-vaccine-trials/,,"Quick Take
A viral meme falsely suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci supports administering a COVID-19 vaccine before clinical trials are completed. Fauci supports the manufacture of vaccines while trials are underway — but only administering the vaccine once the trials are over and it is deemed effective and safe.

Full Story
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become a leading figure in addressing treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19 as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. 
But a meme circulating on Facebook, attributing two quotes to Fauci, falsely suggests an inconsistency in his views on the need for clinical trials before approving a COVID-19 treatment and the process needed to ensure the safety of an eventual vaccine.
The first quote in the meme reads, “Just because hundreds of doctors are reporting hydroxychloroquine is curing some COVID-19 patients, it is not valid until we have a major study done.” Fauci has said that controlled clinical trials are required to make sure hydroxychloroquine is “truly safe and truly effective” against COVID-19, and the evidence so far does not show that it is. 
The second quote reads, “As soon as a COVID-19 vaccine is manufactured, it must be delivered to healthcare professionals for immediate human injection. Proper studies can be done later.” That’s false. Fauci has said distribution and administration of a vaccine would only occur if the clinical trial shows that “in fact it is effective” and safe.
Hydroxychloroquine 
It is true that Fauci has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine before its effectiveness is proven by a large clinical trial. In March, he explained that the evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 is largely “anecdotal” and that without first undergoing a controlled clinical trial — in which a treatment group is compared with a control group — the effectiveness of the drug cannot be known. 
Large trials are still pending, but the evidence so far does not suggest that hydroxychloroquine is effective against COVID-19.
One study, a randomized controlled trial of 150 patients hospitalized with mild to moderate disease in China, did not find the drug helped reduce the chance that patients would test positive for the virus within 28 days — and patients receiving hydroxychloroquine reported more side effects, although most were minor.
In a May 27 interview with CNN, Fauci said, “The scientific data is really quite evident now about the lack of efficacy” of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, and he noted the likelihood of “adverse events with regard to cardiovascular.”
COVID-19 Vaccine
Regarding a COVID-19 vaccine, Fauci did not say that the vaccine will be administered before “proper studies” are over, as the meme claims.
As we’ve written before, Fauci outlined the steps that the COVID-19 vaccine must go through at a February 25 press conference.
Fauci, Feb. 25: Now the thing we need to understand, because we want to make sure that people don’t get confused, that getting a vaccine into a Phase 1 trial within a three-month period, you need at least three to four months to determine if it’s safe and whether it induces the kind of response that you would predict will be protective. Once you do that you graduate to a much larger trial. … When you go to a Phase 2 trial, you’re talking about hundreds if not thousands of individuals to determine efficacy. That is a trial that we would have to conduct in those countries, in those areas, where there’s active transmission. That itself, even at rocket speed, would take at least an additional six to eight months. So when you are talking about the availability of a vaccine even to scale it up you’re talking about a year to a year-and-a-half. 
That timeline was revised on May 15, when the Trump administration announced “Operation Warp Speed” — a national program “to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.” The goal is “to have substantial quantities of a safe and effective vaccine available for Americans by January 2021,” the Department of Health and Human Services said.
In a June 1 interview with STAT News, Fauci explained how the administration would move more quickly to make a vaccine available to the public without compromising public health.
Fauci said manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine would begin “even before you know it works,” which may be the origin of the second quote in the meme. That would allow the vaccine to be widely distributed more quickly, but only “if in fact it is effective,” Fauci said.
“At the same time you’re finishing your Phase 1 trial, you’re preparing your Phase 3 trial sites, which is very expensive, and then you’re starting to manufacture the vaccine even before you know it works. All of that cuts months off,” said Fauci. However, Fauci elaborated, “We’ve designed the Phase 3 trial to very carefully look at safety, even more so than is done in a regular trial.” 
He described the accelerated timeline as “aspirational,” and cautioned that there is “no guarantee” that the vaccine will be proven effective.
Fauci, June 1: If … you’re already manufacturing doses, by December and January, if you’re lucky and if in fact it is effective, you can have a significant number of doses available by the end of the year, the beginning of 2021. So I think it’s aspirational, but it’s certainly doable.
The only thing that’s the big unknown to me is that, is it going to be effective? I think we could do it within the time frame that I’ve outlined. But there’s no guarantee that it’s going to be effective.
Many vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials. One vaccine that shows promise, developed by Moderna in partnership with NIAID, is scheduled in July to enter Phase 3 — the phase in which a vaccine is given to thousands of people to test for safety. Another vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, recently began recruiting participants for Phases 2 and 3 of the clinical trial. 
In a live Q&A with the Journal of the American Medical Association on June 3, Fauci said the plan to manufacture millions of doses of vaccine still undergoing clinical trial is “very unique in vaccine development” and is an investment risk for the companies and the federal government.
Fauci said the plan is to manufacture “close to 100 million doses” by the time clinical trials indicate whether the vaccine is effective, and that “by the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple hundred million of doses.”

221,Video Misrepresents the Science Behind Face Masks,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/video-misrepresents-the-science-behind-face-masks/,,"Quick Take
A viral video misrepresents scientific papers and the reasons for wearing face masks to claim that they are ineffective in mitigating transmission of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that masks may help prevent the spread of the disease.
Full Story
A video pushing misinformation about face masks racked up hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook and YouTube, before the latter removed it for violating the platform’s community standards.
It begins with a promise to answer these questions:
“In our highly politicized climate, it seems like everybody has to be on some kind of team… If we set aside feelings and we just look at facts, what do facts say about wearing a face mask?  What does science say about face masks and whether or not they prevent the spread of viruses like COVID-19?”
But it doesn’t report either facts or science.
Right from the start, in that introduction, the video gets it wrong — COVID-19 isn’t a virus. Rather, it’s the disease that is caused by the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.
More importantly, contrary to its claim that it would cut through the politics of wearing masks, the video actually goes on to misrepresent several scientific papers in an effort to support the claim that wearing a face mask is useless, or worse, that its use is harmful to the wearer.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained that face coverings are meant to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by containing respiratory droplets created when people cough, sneeze or talk. That’s called source control. The CDC has also noted that masks shouldn’t be worn if they are likely to cause harm, and it has said not everyone will be able to wear one.
That’s been the recommendation of the CDC since early April, when the agency changed its original position on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing new studies on the transmission of the novel coronavirus.
We’ve written numerous stories explaining the guidance and correcting misinformation on the issue.
Despite all that, misinformation about masks persists. This video is a particularly polished example since it is produced to look like a television news segment. It’s presented by Ben Swann, a television journalist who won regional Emmy Awards in 2005 and 2009. But Swann has more recently been featured as the co-host of a show called Boom Bust on the Russia-based, government-funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today, and he has made videos pushing conspiracy theories. The video was produced by Swann’s website, called Truth In Media.
Papers Focused on Health Care Workers
In this video, Swann starts off by citing seven scientific papers. He incorrectly refers to them all as “studies,” but only two of them are studies, while the rest are reviews. Reviews are often more comprehensive than individual studies since they provide an overview of a scientific issue by analyzing relevant studies, although they don’t provide new facts or findings of their own.
After listing the papers, Swann says: “All of these are RTCs, randomized controlled tests, that are essentially set up to determine whether or not these N95 respirator masks help to prevent the spread of viruses in this setting, and all of these studies found that they do not.”
Not only is it wrong to say they are all RTCs, or randomized clinical trials — as we said, five of them are reviews of those types of studies — it’s also wrong to characterize their findings that way.
One of the studies and two of the reviews he cites looked at how N95 masks compared to surgical masks in protecting health care workers from getting sick, and the rest of them, similarly, mostly examined how masks generally performed in protecting health care workers from disease.
It’s important to note that nearly all of the studies covered in the reviews were dealing with the use of masks by health care workers, who have more exposure to infected patients than the general public. They also focused on protection from infection, not source control.
Swann then claimed: “In the 2019 study, there was no significant difference by wearing N95 respirator masks. Happened again in 2020.”
But the 2019 study looked at the effect of N95 respirators compared to surgical masks to prevent health care workers from getting the flu and “other viral respiratory infections in geographically diverse, high-exposure, outpatient settings.” It did not examine the use of masks as source control for containing the spread of a virus in the general population. It also didn’t include a group of study subjects who didn’t wear masks at all, so the outcomes of those who wore surgical masks or N95 respirators can’t be compared to outcomes for non-mask wearers.
The 2020 “study” is actually a review that includes the 2019 study along with five other similar studies, looking largely at the effect of masks in protecting health care workers from getting sick.
That review included only one study that wasn’t focused on health care workers. Published in 2009, that study looked at the use of masks in households with a sick child and found that if masks aren’t used regularly and correctly, they won’t be effective in controlling the spread of seasonal viruses. “However,” the study found, “during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced.”
As we’ve written before, there have been relatively few studies looking at the efficacy of face masks on the  public, and the ones that have been done are inconsistent or have not observed large effects.
Swann goes on to claim (emphasis added): “There’s another study that was also done in 2020. It was done by a group of researchers in Hong Kong. The study was conducted just before COVID-19 hysteria took over and the results of it were released just a few weeks ago and, once again, those researchers found the very same thing: that there was, in fact, no statistical reason to believe that face masks will protect you, but improper use of a face mask actually puts you at greater risk of contamination.”
Again, this was a review of previously completed studies, not a new study, and it looked largely at how effective various methods  — including wearing a mask, hand hygiene, covering coughs and sneezes, and cleaning surfaces — would be in responding to an influenza pandemic. The review did include studies of face masks used for source control, but found that “[m]ost studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group.”
The researchers also said, “We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility. However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.”
Swann released a follow-up video about a week after the original and relied heavily on this paper, claiming that it “proves that face masks do not prevent the spread of a virus.”
But one of the researchers who worked on the paper, Benjamin Cowling, told us by email, “It is wrong to say that our review said there was no effectiveness of face masks. We could only rule out very large effects.”
Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, explained that, “while we said there was not a significant effect, we could not exclude the possibility that masks reduce transmission by 10% or 20%. Those would be useful effect sizes.”
He also noted on Twitter that he and his colleagues worked with the World Health Organization in 2019 to come up with guidelines for mitigating pandemic influenza. Those guidelines recommend wearing a mask in “severe epidemics or pandemics.”
As for the claim that using a mask improperly could “put you at greater risk of contamination,” that possibility is mentioned in one sentence in the paper, which cites interim guidance from the WHO to address the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. That two-page WHO paper doesn’t explain what that caution is based on, but it does lay out best practices for wearing masks in the general public, saying:
If masks are worn, proper use and disposal is essential to ensure they are potentially effective and to avoid any increase in risk of transmission associated with the incorrect use of masks. The following information on correct use of masks derives from the practices in health-care settings:

place mask carefully to cover mouth and nose and tie securely to minimise any gaps between the face and the mask
while in use, avoid touching the mask − whenever you touch a used mask, for example when removing or washing, clean hands by washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based handrub
replace masks with a new clean, dry mask as soon as they become damp/humid
do not re-use single-use masks − discard single-use masks after each use and dispose of them immediately upon removing.


Swann next builds on his claim about contamination, saying (emphasis added): “What we’ve been told, over and over, is that if you just wear a cloth mask over your face, it’s better than nothing, so you should do that. And, so, because of that, we have tens of millions of people walking around with cloth masks on their face. Now, get this, in 2015, there was actually a study done taking a look at medical masks versus just a cloth mask and whether or not wearing a cloth mask would protect against the spread of a virus and what that study found in 2015 should alarm you. Not only does wearing a cloth mask not prevent the spread of a virus, it can actually put you at greater risk for catching the virus.”
Again, this study did not look at the effect of masks as source control in slowing the spread of a virus, which is the reason the CDC recommends wearing them. Like most of the other papers cited in this video, it looked at how effective masks were in keeping health care workers from getting sick. And, like the 2019 study, it didn’t include a group who wore no masks, so it couldn’t say whether or not cloth masks might provide more protection than no mask at all.
The study did find that “[m]oisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.” But it said that “[f]urther research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.”
Also, the authors of that study released a statement this year to clarify questions about their 2015 findings in relation to COVID-19. They noted the shortage of personal protective equipment and explained that, in their study conducted in Vietnam, the cloth masks may not have been washed well enough and that the effectiveness of a mask could change depending on the material and the number of layers used.
On top of that, Raina MacIntyre, who was lead researcher on that study, clarified to FactCheck.org in an email, “The findings of the study are not translatable to the community, or to all cloth masks.”
MacIntyre, who heads the biosecurity program at the University of New South Wales’ Kirby Institute, went on to say, “There is also the matter of source control, which is preventing outward transmission from an infected person. A face covering provides a physical barrier.” She stressed that reusable masks have to be cleaned after every use.
The Myth of Rebreathing the Virus
Swann next made this sweeping claim: “Wearing a face mask on a regular basis is unhealthy for you and there are multiple studies that show that.”
That’s based entirely on an article written by Dr. Russell Blaylock, who has pitched several dubious claims over the years and writes an alternative medicine newsletter. Swann focused on the section of the Blaylock article that said health care workers have reported getting headaches with prolonged use of personal protective equipment, which is backed up by two studies cited in Blaylock’s article. Those studies looked at health care workers who wore N95 masks for hours at a time, not shoppers wearing a cloth face covering to go to the grocery store.
Swann also read from another section of Blaylock’s article, paraphrasing it this way: “There’s another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if you’re wearing it for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of that virus with each breath. But if you’re wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask, you’re breathing back in the virus every time you attempt to expel it.”
Swann doesn’t explain what he means, but it sounds like a claim we debunked when it was made in the viral video called “Plandemic” that filled social media feeds in May. In that video, Judy Mikovits, a former chronic fatigue researcher, claimed: “Wearing the mask literally activates your own virus. You’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you’ve got a big problem.”
Experts we talked to at the time said her claim didn’t hold up. Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, told us then, “If you’re shedding (breathing out) virus, then you’re already infected. Even without a mask, infected people who are shedding virus probably rebreathe some of their own viruses, but there are already billions times more viruses in your body. Hopefully, the mask is protecting other people from your exhalations.”
Also, the fact-checking organization Science Feedback addressed the same Blaylock article that Swann cited, debunking the claim that wearing a mask concentrates “exhaled viruses” in the nose, which sends them to the brain. Science Feedback called it “unsupported and illogical.” They wrote: “If someone is exhaling the virus, then they are already infected. The spread of the infection would be largely determined by how well the person’s immune system fights off the infection, not by whether they inhaled virus particles that they previously exhaled.”
Misrepresenting Dr. Fauci
Swann wrapped up the video with a misrepresentation aimed at Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“Even the biggest doctor of them all in this country, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who keeps talking about this issue, referred to wearing a face mask as mostly symbolic. Listen to his words — he called it, ‘mostly symbolic,'” Swann said.
Here’s what Fauci actually said on CNN’s “Newsroom”: “I wear it for the reason that I believe it is effective. It’s not 100% effective. I mean, it’s sort of, respect for another person and have that person respect you — you wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other. I mean I do it when I’m in the public for the reasons, A) I want to protect myself and protect others and also I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that’s the kind of thing you should be doing.”
Regardless of Fauci’s real message, Swann used his twisted version of it to draw the conclusion that the recommendation to wear face masks is not about public health, but about the “submission of the public.” Looking at the camera, Swann asked, “Are we being forced to submit merely because politicians want us to?”
Like his bogus claims based on misrepresentations of scientific papers, that claim is based on a misrepresentation of Fauci’s statement. Swann offered no further support for it.

222,Birx Spins ‘Extraordinarily Low Numbers’ of Coronavirus Cases,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/birx-spins-extraordinarily-low-numbers-of-coronavirus-cases/,,"Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, misleadingly claimed that 19 states — “almost 40% of the country” — “have less than 200 cases” of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. In fact, 17 states with 7.2% of the U.S. population have fewer than 200 confirmed cases each.
Birx made her remarks at a task force press briefing at the White House on March 26 on a day when the United States passed China and became the country with the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. As of March 26, the U.S. had more than 83,000 confirmed cases and more than 1,200 deaths, according to data collected by John Hopkins University.
At the same briefing, President Donald Trump spoke about wanting to soon open “large sections of our country that aren’t so seriously affected.” The president has said he would “love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” as he put it during a Fox News virtual town hall on March 24.
Public health officials have warned that going back to business in a couple of weeks would worsen the coronavirus outbreak. “This disease will not respect state borders and city borders, and will move around this country just like it’s moved around the world,” Tom Inglesby, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the New York Times.
Birx — formerly the U.S. global AIDS coordinator — lent support to Trump’s basic message that large sections of the U.S. aren’t seriously affected. But she was actually speaking about a small section of the country in terms of population.
Birx, March 26: So just as a summary of where it looks domestically — I won’t talk so much about the global issues this time: We do have 19 out of our 50 states, to be reminded, that had early cases but have persistently low level of cases and, at this point, have less than 200 cases. So that’s almost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers.
It’s true that 19 states divided by 50 states is 38%, or “almost 40%.” That’s “basic math,” as a White House official told us. But it’s also misleading.
First, using the data collected by John Hopkins University, we found that only 17 states — not 19 — had fewer than 200 cases as of March 26, when Birx made her remarks.

Second, those 17 states have a combined population of 23,719,483, or just 7.2% of the total U.S. population of 328,239,523, according to 2019 population estimates by the Census Bureau. (See the pie chart below.)



Five of the 17 states have fewer than 1 million people each. South Dakota, population 884,659, had the fewest COVID-19 confirmed cases with 46 cases, according to John Hopkins University.
California alone has more residents than the 17 states combined. The Golden State has a population of 39.5 million people. It also has 3,899 confirmed cases as of March 26.
The 17 states have 1,872, or 2.2%, of the total cases nationwide.
We would caution that these are only the confirmed cases, based on the testing the states have done. Some tests may still be pending, and some states have conducted more testing than others.
But while Birx boasts about “almost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers,” the fact is that only 7.2% of the population lives in those states.",Eugene Kiely,2020-03-27 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Birx, March 26: So just as a summary of where it looks domestically — I won’t talk so much about the global issues this time: We do have 19 out of our 50 states, to be reminded, that had early cases but have persistently low level of cases and, at this point, have less than 200 cases.

223,Instagram Post Missing Context About Israeli Study on COVID-19 Natural Immunity,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/scicheck-instagram-post-missing-context-about-israeli-study-on-covid-19-natural-immunity/,,"
An Instagram post highlighted a headline about a non-peer-reviewed study from Israel that found that unvaccinated people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had greater immunity against the delta variant than never-infected people fully vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine. But the social media post omitted the study’s other finding that one dose of the vaccine enhanced protection for infection survivors.
According to its authors, a study conducted in Israel demonstrated that natural immunity from a prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 provided “longer lasting and stronger protection” against the highly transmissible delta variant than vaccine-induced immunity from two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Some social media users are highlighting that finding — which is far from conclusive — while ignoring that the study also said that previously infected individuals can still benefit from vaccination.
The texastruther Instagram account, for example, posted a screen capture of an Aug. 27 Gateway Pundit headline that says, “New Israeli Study Finds Fully Vaccinated People are at ‘Greater Risk of Hospitalization’ and 13 TIMES MORE LIKELY to Catch Covid-19 Than Those Who Have Recovered and Have Natural Immunity.”
What was not mentioned in the Instagram post — which received more than 4,600 likes on the platform — is that the study found even greater immunity against the delta variant for people who got a single shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and had an infection with the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
It’s true that in many cases, natural immunity can provide better protection from certain diseases than immunity from vaccination, as we’ve written before. But we’ve also written about scientific studies that show the benefits of vaccination for those who contracted the coronavirus and then recovered from infection.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends that people still get vaccinated regardless of whether they already had COVID-19, because it’s not known how long someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again after recovering from the disease. A small proportion of people who had an infection may not develop much immunity at all.
In addition, experts say that people should not interpret the Israeli study’s findings as an endorsement to intentionally get infected as a way to obtain natural immunity. That would be extremely risky, as more than 633,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in the United States alone. Even some who survive an infection experience so-called “long COVID,” which is when symptoms from the disease last for weeks or months.
The Study
The retrospective observational study is the largest to compare natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity, according to its authors. It was posted Aug. 25 to the medRxiv preprint server, which means it has not been peer-reviewed and “has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.”

Using data on tens of thousands of patients (age 16 and older) from the Maccabi Healthcare Services database in Israel, a team of researchers compared the health outcomes, including infections, symptoms and hospitalizations, of three different groups of people. The analysis included individuals never infected with SARS-CoV-2 who received the two-dose regimen of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, previously infected individuals who had not been vaccinated, and individuals who had an infection and received a single dose of the vaccine, either before or after the infection.


Among a group of more than 32,000 people either previously infected or fully vaccinated between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28, the authors found a 13-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection with the delta variant as opposed to reinfection. The frequency of either event, however, was still very low, as this was based on 238 breakthrough infections, or infections in fully vaccinated individuals, and 19 reinfections among unvaccinated people who had recovered from a previous bout with the virus.


The authors also found a 27-fold increased risk for symptomatic breakthrough infection after full vaccination as opposed to symptomatic reinfection. That was based on 191 infections in vaccinated individuals and eight in previously infected people.


Then, when comparing over 46,000 individuals who were fully vaccinated between January and February with the same number of unvaccinated people who were infected at any time between March 2020 and February 2021, the authors discovered about a 6-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection as opposed to reinfection. They also found a more than 7-fold increased risk for symptomatic breakthrough infection than symptomatic reinfection. 
The authors said the results “could suggest waning natural immunity against the Delta variant,” which was prevalent in Israel during the study’s follow-up period of June 1 to Aug. 14.
In both comparisons, the fully-vaccinated individuals also had a “greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations” than those with natural immunity from a previous infection, the study said. There were no COVID-19-related deaths recorded in the study.
Importantly, though, the researchers also found that previously infected people benefited from vaccination, as those who received a single dose of the vaccine were about half as likely (0.53 fold) to be reinfected as those who did not get the shot. The single dose vaccinees also had fewer recorded cases of symptomatic disease (16) than their unvaccinated counterparts (23).
For those vaccinated after an infection, specifically, there was “a similar, though not significant, trend of decreased risk of reinfection,” the authors said.
But that part of the analysis was not featured in the Gateway Pundit headline — or its article — which was amplified on social media.
The Study’s Limitations
Furthermore, the authors of the study acknowledged that it had several limitations.
For one, they said that the analysis only assessed protection from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine “and therefore does not address other vaccines or long-term protection following a third dose, of which the deployment is underway in Israel.” As of Aug. 31, about 62% of Israel’s population was fully vaccinated and about another 6% were only partially vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford-based project Our World in Data.


The authors also said that because they conducted an “observational real-world study,” where polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, screening for the coronavirus was not required, “we might be underestimating asymptomatic infections, as these individuals often do not get tested.”
The testing aspect was perhaps “the biggest limitation of the study,” according to Natalie Dean, an Emory University biostatistician, who was quoted in an Aug. 26 Science article about the study. “That means, she says, that comparisons could be confounded if, for example, previously infected people who developed mild symptoms were less likely to get tested than vaccinated people, perhaps because they think they are immune,” Science reported.
“Lastly,” the authors of the Israeli study wrote, “although we controlled for age, sex, and region of residence, our results might be affected by differences between the groups in terms of health behaviors (such as social distancing and mask wearing), a possible confounder that was not assessed.”
The Science article also quoted Charlotte Thålin, a physician and immunology researcher at Danderyd Hospital and the Karolinska Institute, who cautioned that the number of infections and other outcomes on which the comparisons were based were quite “small.”
For instance, the study’s finding that never-infected vaccinees were at higher risk for COVID-19-related hospitalization than the previously infected non-vaccinees was based on no more than about two dozen hospitalizations in either of the comparisons.
In the part of the analysis that compared the outcomes of people previously infected or fully vaccinated in January or February, the study said “nine cases of COVID-19-related hospitalizations were recorded, 8 of which were in the vaccinated group and 1 in the previously infected group.”
In the part of the analysis that looked at individuals who were fully vaccinated in either January or February and unvaccinated people who were infected at some point between March of last year and February of this year, the study said “COVID-19 related hospitalizations occurred in 4 and 21 of the reinfection and breakthrough infection groups, respectively.”
Other scientists have raised additional concerns about the study’s methodologies and conclusions.
In an extensive Twitter thread, Diego Bassani, an epidemiologist at the Hospital for Sick Children and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto, said that the study’s “very large ORs,” or odds ratios, “indicate something could be off with sample selection or response measurement.” He also said the fact that the study matched groups by age could introduce a bias in the results, since the previously infected group only includes those who survived their first infection, whereas the vaccinated group did not.
It’s worth noting that two other studies have come to different conclusions about the relative potency of natural versus vaccine-induced immunity, although each is also subject to its own limitations and is not definitive.
One unpublished paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed, from researchers at Oxford University, found that the protection against any kind of confirmed infection with delta by the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was slightly better than natural infection.
Another study, published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in August, found that unvaccinated residents of Kentucky who were infected with the coronavirus in 2020 were more than twice as likely to become reinfected in May and June 2021, compared with those who were previously infected and fully vaccinated.
Don’t Try to Get Infected
In any case, experts advise against purposely getting infected in hopes of acquiring some degree of immunity.
“What we don’t want people to say is: ‘All right, I should go out and get infected, I should have an infection party,'” Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University, told Science in response to the study. “Because somebody could die,” he warned.
And on Twitter, Alessandro Sette of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology wrote that the question is not “should I get COVID or be vaccinated?”
“COVID is associated with high disease burden, risk of death and long-lasting health issues (long COVID), in contrast with the excellent safety profile of vaccination,” he tweeted. “The question is ‘should I get vaccinated even if I previously had covid?’ People that were infected and then vaccinated develop a powerful immune response, called ‘hybrid immunity’, which exceeds what is seen with either natural infection or vaccination.”
That’s in line with what the preprint study from Israel also found.
Clarification, Sept. 8: We updated the story to make clear that the Israeli study found a trend toward a decreased risk of reinfection for people vaccinated after an infection, but it wasn’t significant. We also added language to clarify that the other study published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report analyzed the risk of reinfection for unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people who were previously infected.",D'Angelo Gore,2021-09-02 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"The authors also said that because they conducted an “observational real-world study,” where polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, screening for the coronavirus was not required, “we might be underestimating asymptomatic infections, as these individuals often do not get tested.”

224,Health Sensors Misconstrued as Government Tracking ‘Microchips’,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-health-sensors-misconstrued-as-government-tracking-microchips/,,"SciCheck Digest
A digital device company is developing gel sensors that would monitor the wearer’s health and could potentially help to detect future outbreaks of disease. But conspiracy theorists are falsely claiming that the sensors are actually COVID-19-detecting microchips that will be used to track people’s movements.

Full Story
A California company called Profusa is using federal grant money to develop sensors that would monitor the wearer’s health if they choose to use it.
Dr. Matt Hepburn, a Department of Defense infectious disease physician, mentioned the project in a “60 Minutes” episode reporting on various government projects aimed at ending the COVID-19 pandemic and preventing future outbreaks.
The show was careful to make clear that the device is “not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.” But, still, the segment has become fodder for conspiracy theorists and misinformation profiteers who claim that it’s evidence of government plans to track people with microchips.
One of the first such examples of this claim came from Ben Swann, a purveyor of dubious claims and conspiracy theories whom we’ve written about before.
“For almost a year, we have heard from so many so-called conspiracy theorists how the COVID vaccine is going to contain a microchip because the government wants to track you,” Swann said in a video shared on his private platform and on YouTube. “Of course we’ve heard that that’s all crazy. And yet, on Sunday, a new report from ’60 Minutes’ includes an interview with a scientist from the Pentagon who says that there is now a COVID microchip.”
Swann made the same claim in a segment on the Russia-based, government-funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today, which describes him as the network’s “investigative journalist.”
Although Swann’s claim came shortly after the “60 Minutes” segment aired in April, similar versions continue to be repeated on social media.
For example, Ben Irawan, an Australian pastor who sought political office in 2019 on the Australian Conservatives line, posted a clip of the “60 Minutes” segment on his Facebook page and directed viewers to his Telegram account, which he says he created “due to censorship.” He posted the same clip on Telegram with a message that referenced the biblical “mark of the beast,” which has become a common means of discrediting COVID-19 vaccines to religious audiences who incorrectly believe the vaccines contain a microchip.
But, in reality, the sensor Hepburn mentioned isn’t a microchip, it isn’t related to the vaccine, and it isn’t even commercially available in the U.S.
Here’s what it is: A small gel sensor inserted under the skin that can monitor body chemistry when paired with a separate device.
It was developed by Profusa with the help of a $7.5 million Department of Defense grant in 2016, but is still in clinical trials in the U.S.
In a phone interview, Hepburn described the sensor as has having a “squishy, rubbery texture.” It doesn’t have metal or electronic components, he said, and it would have no way of tracking or communicating a person’s location.
The sensor can detect only one thing at a time, Hepburn said — like glucose, for example, which would be useful for diabetics who typically have to prick their fingers to monitor their blood sugar levels.
The changes that it detects can be read only by a specifically designed device held up to the skin, Hepburn said. That device would then communicate the information to an app installed on the user’s phone. The device itself doesn’t have the capability to track a person’s location, he said, but smartphones are often equipped with apps that track their users’ locations. As with existing apps that track location, though, it’s the user’s choice to agree to those terms and use the app.
It’s also important to note that the sensor can’t detect pathogens, Hepburn said, so it couldn’t detect COVID-19. But it could potentially sense chemical changes in the body that indicate viral, bacterial, or fungal infection early on. So, the sensor may be able to be used as an early signal for severe infections.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, is funding two clinical studies to see if the sensor could be used in this way to detect disease following a bio-terror event, Jared Adams, a DARPA spokesman, told us in an email. DARPA is an agency within the Department of Defense that supports research and development of new technologies that could bolster national security. In the past, DARPA invested in Moderna’s mRNA vaccine technology.
Similar to Hepburn, Adams explained that the sensor “is inert, does not have any electrical components, and is of similar material to a contact lens or corneal implant.”
He also said, “For these reasons, there is no such thing as a ‘biochip’ the government could use to track people.”
Currently, one version of the Profusa system has been approved for use in the European Union. That system monitors tissue oxygen levels. It is still in the clinical trial phase in the U.S.
So, it’s wrong to claim this sensor is actually a microchip that will be installed by the government to track people’s movements. As we said, the sensor inserted below the skin doesn’t have the ability to track movement and, if it does get approved for use in the U.S., it would be anyone’s choice to use it.

225,"Chiropractor Again Peddles False, Misleading COVID-19 Claims",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-chiropractor-again-peddles-false-misleading-covid19-claims/,,"SciCheck Digest
The delta variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is more transmissible than previous forms of the virus, and has helped spur an increase in cases, including in children. But a chiropractor in a Facebook video wrongly claims that “it is not showing more of a problem.” That’s one of several misleading and false claims he makes about COVID-19.

A St. Louis chiropractor who in April was accused by federal officials of deceptively marketing unproven COVID-19 treatments is airing baseless and false claims about the novel coronavirus that causes the disease and public health measures designed to prevent its spread.

Eric Nepute — who was the first person charged with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, and who has spread misinformation that we’ve debunked before — took to an Aug. 17 livestream on Facebook to baselessly suggest that recent pandemic-related events, as well as the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, are somehow actually efforts “to keep you distracted” from the issue of voter fraud.
In the video, viewed more than 60,000 times, Nepute continues by rattling off a string of false and misleading claims related to COVID-19 — including about the delta variant, and certain mask and vaccine requirements. We fact-checked several of his claims.
Delta Distortions
Referring to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that everyone in schools — regardless of vaccination status — use face masks, Nepute claims that it’s “all because of the quote unquote delta variant.” He claims that the variant “is not showing more deaths, it is not showing more of a problem — we are not seeing pediatric hospitals filled. They’re trying to scare you.”
First of all, as we’ve explained, the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is about twice as transmissible as the original versions of the virus. In July, it became the dominant strain in the U.S. and is now estimated to account for virtually all infections. Though, it’s unclear whether the variant, while more transmissible, actually causes more severe disease.
The rise of delta has helped spur a significant spike in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are up significantly from early July, according to CDC data. It also prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that even vaccinated individuals wear masks indoors in areas with substantial or high transmission of the coronavirus.
Children do continue to comprise a very small portion of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association estimated, based on data collected from 23 states and New York City, that as of Aug. 19 “children ranged from 1.6%-3.6% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and 0.2%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.”
That said, the number of children being admitted to hospitals for the disease also has continued to increase since early July, CDC data show. The U.S. averaged 303 new daily hospital admissions for children with confirmed COVID-19 during the week of Aug. 16 to Aug. 22 — a new high.
Total pediatric hospital admissions for COVID-19 reached a high of nearly 2,000 earlier this month. Some children’s hospitals have reported nearing capacity, with some officials citing COVID-19 cases as well as increased cases of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, division chief of infectious diseases at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., told NPR that delta’s increased transmissibility was likely to blame for the larger volume of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in children.
“If you have a larger number of cases overall and you apply that percentage, you’re going to see children hospitalized,” she said. “And that’s really the most important take home for families is that there’s nothing particularly more dangerous about the delta variant for children, but it has always remained a danger.”
The AAP reported based on available state data that, as of Aug. 19, more than 180,000 COVID-19 cases in children “were added the past week, reaching levels of the previous winter surge of 2020-21.”
“After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over a four-fold increase the past month, rising from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22nd to 180,000 the past week,” the organization said. 
In an Aug. 5 letter to the Food and Drug Administration regarding the need to vaccinate children against COVID-19, AAP President Lee Savio Beers wrote that the rise in cases showed that “the Delta variant has created a new and pressing risk to children and adolescents across this country, as it has also done for unvaccinated adults.”
Later in his video, Nepute tells his viewers: “There was a news reporter in Texas that was misrepresenting the numbers in Texas hospitals for pediatric sicknesses and deaths. They’re trying to completely distract you.”
It’s true that an Aug. 12 news report in the Texas Tribune erroneously reported the number of children recently hospitalized with COVID-19 in Texas. The original story mistakenly referred to the total number hospitalized since the pandemic began. But what Nepute doesn’t mention is that the newspaper corrected itself the same day, affixing a prominent correction at the top of its story online and notifying readers of the error.

Missed Mark on Mask, Vaccine Mandates
Nepute also uses the video to argue against local mask mandates and vaccine requirements by distorting the facts about what federal officials are requiring of their own ranks.
“When the truth is, the White House is not even mandating masks,” Nepute claims. “When the truth is that the CDC and the World Health Organization are not even mandating the vaccines. They’re not mandating these injections. And so why are they trying to mandate them on you when they’re not doing it for themselves?”

President Joe Biden and the members of the Seattle Storm, the 2020 WNBA champions, wearing masks during an Aug. 23 event at the White House.
But contrary to Nepute’s claims, the White House reimposed indoor mask requirements for staff, regardless of vaccination status, in late July. CDC guidance recommends face masks be worn indoors in areas with substantial or high transmission of COVID-19. Washington, D.C., is currently experiencing “high” transmission, according to CDC data.
And the U.S. has started to implement a policy that requires all federal employees — which includes employees of the CDC — to attest to being vaccinated against COVID-19, or else comply with mitigation measures. Those measures include complying with routine testing, maintaining physical distance from others, and some travel restrictions. So while not a full-blown mandate, CDC employees are expected to either be vaccinated or comply with certain restrictions.
A WHO spokesperson told us there is currently no COVID-19 vaccine mandate for its staff. But while Nepute claims the organization is “trying to mandate them on you,” it has not necessarily endorsed mandatory vaccinations.
The WHO published an April policy brief in which it did not endorse or object to the use of such mandates, but outlined ethical considerations.
In a statement, the WHO said it “does not envision that countries will implement mandates for vaccination against COVID-19 at this time, but there are certainly situations where a strong recommendation to be vaccinated might be issued. One example would be health care professionals, to ensure the safety of both staff and the patients.”
“However, in situations where voluntary vaccine uptake is inadequate and COVID-19 transmission rates remain unacceptably high, it is possible that some countries may consider introducing mandatory programmes in the interest of saving lives,” the WHO statement said. “Extreme care should be taken with the implementation of such mandates or requirements, including the use of any penalties or fines, as they can reinforce social and health inequalities.”
Baseless Claim of Removals of Children in Australia
Turning his attention to other countries, Nepute proceeds by making a fact-free claim about the Australian government “taking children” from their homes in the name of COVID-19 safety.
“They’re already taking children out of homes that there’s possible risk of COVID in — they’re putting them in detainment camps,” Nepute claims. “The prime minister of health … in Australia talked about the camps, and how the kids are going to be well taken care of and there’s going to be plenty of things for them to do there.”
While Australia is currently under a very strict lockdown — and there are some quarantine facilities used in Australia for travelers — we found nothing to back up his claim regarding the forced removal of children from homes.
Other fact-checkers have addressed similar claims.
Nepute may be referring to Aug. 6 remarks by Brad Hazzard, minister for health and medical research of New South Wales, encouraging high school students to attend a voluntary vaccine drive at the Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia. Hazzard told families dropping their children off — since “we don’t want too many people obviously milling around inside the arena” — that “your children will be well looked after, inside, when they arrive.”
Again, though, that was a voluntary opportunity for young people to get vaccinated. Hazzard wasn’t talking about forced removals of children or “detainment camps,” as Nepute says.
About 25% of Australia’s population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 so far, according to Our World in Data, based at the University of Oxford.

The AAP reported based on available state data that, as of Aug. 19, more than 180,000 COVID-19 cases in children “were added the past week, reaching levels of the previous winter surge of 2020-21.”
“After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over a four-fold increase the past month, rising from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22nd to 180,000 the past week,” the organization said. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association estimated, based on data collected from 23 states and New York City, that as of Aug. 19 “children ranged from 1.6%-3.6% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and 0.2%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.”
That said, the number of children being admitted to hospitals for the disease also has continued to increase since early July, CDC data show. Hazzard told families dropping their children off — since “we don’t want too many people obviously milling around inside the arena” — that “your children will be well looked after, inside, when they arrive.”
Again, though, that was a voluntary opportunity for young people to get vaccinated. One example would be health care professionals, to ensure the safety of both staff and the patients.”
“However, in situations where voluntary vaccine uptake is inadequate and COVID-19 transmission rates remain unacceptably high, it is possible that some countries may consider introducing mandatory programmes in the interest of saving lives,” the WHO statement said. “Extreme care should be taken with the implementation of such mandates or requirements, including the use of any penalties or fines, as they can reinforce social and health inequalities.”
Baseless Claim of Removals of Children in Australia

226,Baseless Conspiracy Theories Claim New Coronavirus Was Bioengineered,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/baseless-conspiracy-theories-claim-new-coronavirus-was-bioengineered/,,"10.8KQuick Take
Several online stories inaccurately claim that the new coronavirus contains HIV “insertions” and shows signs of being created in a lab. But there is no evidence that the new virus was bioengineered, and every indication it came from an animal.

Full Story 
The latest conspiracy theories about the new coronavirus, which first led to an outbreak in Wuhan, China in late 2019, allege that the virus was man-made, rather than the natural result of people coming into contact with wild animals.
We’ve seen similar claims before, but this time many claims are being fueled by an unpublished — and highly dubious — scientific paper. By delving into the genetic or protein sequences of the virus, many of these stories have an aura of scientific credibility. But scientists who study viruses say they are incorrect.
One set of stories, subsequently shared on Facebook, inaccurately asserts a link between the new coronavirus, also known as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, and HIV, largely based on an unpublished manuscript by scientists in India.
The paper, which was posted on the preprint website bioRxiv (pronounced “bio-archive”) on Jan. 31, claimed to have identified very short “insertions” in the virus’ protein sequence that had an “uncanny similarity” to HIV. Numerous scientists, however, almost immediately pointed out flaws in the analysis, noting that the sequences are so short, they match a bevy of other organisms — and there’s no reason to conclude they derive from HIV. The paper was voluntarily withdrawn by its authors just two days later, with one saying, “It was not our intention to feed into the conspiracy theories and no such claims are made here.”
But the speedy withdrawal wasn’t fast enough to prevent some websites from picking up the story and concluding that the new coronavirus had been crafted in a laboratory.
A ZeroHedge article with the headline, “Coronavirus Contains ‘HIV Insertions,’ Stoking Fears Over Artificially Created Bioweapon,” pounced on some of the language in the preprint to argue that the scientists were saying the virus might be “man-made.” The story also cited tweets from a visiting scientist at Harvard who had commented on the preprint and stated that the scientist’s tweets suggested that the virus “might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon.”
ZeroHedge is a website that we’ve written about before, including for spreading the false idea that the new coronavirus was stolen from a lab in Canada and then weaponized by the Chinese government.
Originally published the same day of the preprint, the ZeroHedge article was updated the following day to include tweets from the Harvard visiting scientist, who by then had seen some of the criticisms of the preprint and was now advocating for additional studies to be done before jumping to any conclusions. The Harvard scientist, it should be said, is an epidemiologist, health economist and nutritionist, and does not have expertise in virology or bioinformatics. The bulk of the article, however, remains unchanged.
Well after the preprint was withdrawn, a website that traffics in vaccine misinformation, Health Impact News, also highlighted the invalid HIV connection.
Separately, a blogger posted a different bogus analysis — also making the rounds on Facebook — that posits a portion of the new coronavirus genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus. Based on this, the author argues that the new virus could have leaked from a Chinese lab working on a vaccine. The SARS virus caused a global outbreak in 2003 and is similar but distinct from 2019-nCoV.
Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind InfoWars and the false idea that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was a hoax, also waded into the coronavirus misinformation pool. Multiple episodes of his talk show address both of these groundless theories and claim there is evidence that “proves” the new coronavirus was “man-made.”
Scientists with expertise in viral genomics, however, say that no such evidence exists. Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that in both cases, the analyses are “completely wrong.”
The HIV study, he said, was a “misunderstanding of how to perform these types of analyses” that also cherry-picked its findings. The short proteins the Indian scientists found to be similar to HIV are not from HIV at all, Andersen said, but are the result of the natural evolution of coronaviruses. “Had the authors compared nCoV to related bat viruses (and not just SARS as they did),” he wrote, “they would have realized that the peptides are also present in the bat viruses — and most certainly don’t come from HIV.”
Indeed, other experts have noted the same shortcomings, including Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who performed the proper sequence alignments and shared the results in a Twitter thread. He found that all of the so-called “insertions” appear in a bat virus identified from a cave in Yunnan, China — or were artifacts of improper alignment. 
Only one “insertion” is not fully shared with the bat virus, Bedford explained, and “in no way suggests engineering” since it is consistent with the types of insertions and deletions that happen in coronaviruses. “There is absolutely no evidence for either (1) sequence insertions or (2) their relationship to HIV,” he concluded.
The blogger’s contention that the new coronavirus may have been engineered using a SARS viral vector, Andersen said, is “just as absurd” as the HIV theory. The vector, he said, was used to understand coronaviruses and develop vaccines — but is different from 2019nCoV.
“While they’re similar (like worms and people are similar) there is absolutely no way that nCoV is in any way related,” he said. “If one were to look at the two genomes side by side, it’s very easy to show that they’re obviously not the same — or that one somehow led to the other.”
HIV Drugs
As we’ve just established, there’s no connection between HIV and the new coronavirus, but the fact that some countries are using HIV drugs to treat the new coronavirus is included in many of the social media posts to lend credence to the bogus theory.
One Facebook post says, “Ask yourself why they have been treating with HIV drugs from the start,” and the ZeroHedge story proclaims, “The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications.”
In fact, it’s not yet clear if the virus does respond to HIV drugs — but the rationale to try it is pretty simple. Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told us in a phone interview that there aren’t that many FDA-approved antiviral drugs, so when a new virus emerges, doctors just give patients “whatever they think might help.” 
Many existing antivirals, he said, are HIV medications, so it’s natural to turn to those. And there is some precedent for HIV drugs possibly working against coronaviruses. 
During the SARS outbreak, for example, scientists performed a drug screen and identified the HIV drug cocktail of lopinavir and ritonavir as having potential antiviral activity against SARS. That drug combo was also associated with better outcomes among a small group of SARS patients, although it was never tested in a clinical trial, so it’s hard to say if it was truly effective. It is also currently being tested in a clinical trial in Saudi Arabia against another disease caused by a coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
Sheahan, however, is skeptical that HIV drugs will be very effective against the new virus. The levels of the drug that are likely required to diminish viral replication, he said, “are not achievable” in people. And in his experiments against the MERS virus in cell culture and in mice, he found lopinavir and ritonavir offered little improvement in severe lung disease or viral replication.
No Signs of Bioengineering
As for the general notion that the virus has been bioengineered, there’s no evidence that’s true. On the contrary, as we’ve explained before, all lines of evidence point to the virus coming from an animal. That’s consistent with what scientists have learned about the ecology of coronaviruses in the last 20 years, Sheahan said, including SARS and MERS — and it fits with the fact that the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus. 
“The genetic data is pointing to this virus coming from a bat reservoir,” he said, “not a lab.”
And not only are there no HIV “insertions” in the virus, but by looking at the virus’ genome, scientists also see zero signs of human tampering.
Bedford, the Fred Hutchinson computational biologist, pointed out on Twitter that the virus’ genetic differences to its most recent common ancestor are “consistent with differences expected to arise during natural evolution.”
An engineered virus, he explained, would likely have a “distorted” amino acid to nucleotide ratio, and also have changes focused in on a “subset of genes.” In other words, when engineering occurs, it’s usually to bring about a meaningful change to the virus — but there’s no evidence of that in the 2019-nCoV genome. 
Typically, scientists change nucleotides in a targeted way to create changes in the amino acids they code for. Since amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, that’s the way to change the proteins the virus produces. 
But as Bedford said, out of all the nucleotide changes, relatively few — around 14% — alter the corresponding amino acid, or about what you would expect in a naturally evolving virus. This ratio also matches that of the bat virus that’s found to be the most similar to 2019-nCoV.
Further, when comparing the amino acid changes that do exist, the number of changes in the respective genes in both 2019-nCoV and the bat virus are highly similar. Again, if the virus had been engineered, one might expect many of the changes to cluster in one or two genes, but that’s not the case here. All of this argues against the idea of the new virus having come out of a lab.

227,Experts: No Link Between COVID-19 Vaccines and Erectile Dysfunction,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/scicheck-experts-no-link-between-covid-19-vaccines-and-erectile-dysfunction/,,"Public health officials around the world have explained that erectile dysfunction is not a side effect of COVID-19 vaccines, but a viral tweet from rapper Nicki Minaj has spread the unfounded claim that it is. There is no evidence to support that claim.

Contrary to what rapper Nicki Minaj claimed in a viral tweet on Sept. 13, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause erectile dysfunction, or ED.
But there is some preliminary research that suggests COVID-19 itself may be associated with ED. We’ll explain more on that below.
Minaj’s tweet was one of several following her announcement that she wouldn’t attend the annual Met Gala due to the COVID-19 vaccine requirements for the event. Although Minaj expressed hesitancy about getting vaccinated in her tweets, she also said that she would likely get a vaccine before going on her next tour.
The tweet that went viral was vague, saying: “My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen.” But it garnered more than 110,000 likes and praise from conservative commentators who have sown doubt about the vaccines, such as Candace Owens and Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
Although Minaj didn’t specify which vaccine her cousin’s friend supposedly got or why she thought his condition was related, medical experts and public health authorities from around the world have said the claim that the vaccines could cause ED is false.
The health minister for Trinidad and Tobago, Terrence Deyalsingh, responded to the claim at a press conference on Sept. 15, saying, “As far as we know, at this point in time, there has been no such reported either side effect or adverse event. And what was sad about this is that it wasted our time yesterday trying to track down because we take all these claims seriously, whether it’s on social media or mainstream media.”
Dr. Sandro Demaio, who leads the health promotion foundation for the Australian state of Victoria, took to Twitter on Sept. 13 to say, “The covid vaccines DO NOT cause erectile disfunction or male infertility.” A Welsh public health site published a straight-forward post debunking the same claim in July, saying: “There have been no reports of impotence linked to vaccination and vaccination is recommended as a protection against this side-effect of Covid infection.”
In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that those who are trying to have a baby — both male and female — get vaccinated against COVID-19. And Dr. Y. Sammy Choi, director of the department of research at Fort Bragg’s Womack Army Medical Center, said on a recent podcast, “There is no evidence that any of the vaccines leads to erectile dysfunction, sterility, infertility, in man or woman.”
Also, CNN host Jake Tapper asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a Sept. 14 interview to address Minaj’s post: “Is there any evidence that the Pfizer or the Moderna or the J&J vaccines cause any reproductive issues in men or women?”
“The answer to that, Jake, is a resounding no. There’s no evidence that it happens, nor is there any mechanistic reason to imagine that it would happen,” Fauci said, adding that “the only way we know to counter mis- and disinformation is to provide a lot of correct information and to essentially debunk these kinds of claims which, you know, may be innocent on her part.”
Infection with COVID-19, not COVID-19 Vaccination, May Be Associated with ED
So, as we said, experts agree there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause ED. But there is some preliminary evidence of a possible association between the disease COVID-19 and ED from two studies, though the authors stressed more research is needed.
A paper published in the journal Andrology in March found that the prevalence of ED was “significantly higher” in men who had tested positive for COVID-19. The study, which was done in Italy, included 25 men who had tested positive for COVID-19 and 75 men who had tested negative. The authors called for “more adequately tailored studies,” calling their study the first to investigate “the prevalence of ED and the possible association between ED and COVID-19 from real-life data in a large survey.”
And a much smaller pilot study done in the U.S. that involved two patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently suffered from ED suggested that the disease “affects the penis,” according to Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy, director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine who worked on the study and wrote about it on the news website The Conversation. The study, the authors claimed, is “the first to demonstrate the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the penis long after the initial infection in humans.”
“[T]he research is only a first step on how COVID-19 might affect male sexual health; the samples were small,” Ramasamy wrote. “Studies should continue.”",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-09-16 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"And Dr. Y.

228,"Trump Exaggerates Progress, Credit on Future COVID-19 Vaccine",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trump-exaggerates-progress-credit-on-future-covid-19-vaccine/,,"In a Labor Day press conference and at a rally in North Carolina the following day, President Donald Trump made several unsupported or inaccurate statements about a COVID-19 vaccine and distorted comments made by the Democratic ticket.

Trump charged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris with spreading “anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.” The candidates support properly approved vaccines, but have expressed concerns — shared by some in the scientific community — that Trump may not follow the standard protocols.
The president claimed without support that “if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn’t have it all.”
Trump inaccurately said that “we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas” and that “the numbers are looking unbelievably strong.” No trial has met its enrollment target of 30,000, and no one knows yet how the vaccines are performing.
While insisting that he has never said there will definitely be a vaccine in October or November, Trump repeated the idea that it was possible, and previously said that such timing was likely. Health officials have said a vaccine is unlikely to be available that soon.

Biden/Harris Vaccine Statements
The president distorted what Biden and Harris have said about a COVID-19 vaccine, calling for them to apologize for their “anti-vaccine rhetoric.” The candidates have said that they are supportive of a safe and effective vaccine, but not one based on Trump’s word alone.
“[Biden and Harris] should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science,” Trump said in his Labor Day press conference.
“And what’s happening is, all of a sudden, you’ll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric — it’s a politic rhetoric; that’s all it is. Just for politics,” he continued. “Because now they see we’ve done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before.”
Later, Trump focused on Harris, saying, “[S]he’s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement.”
The next day during a rally in North Carolina, Trump repeated the same sentiments, but went further to say that the pair was spreading “anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”
The White House did not explain which comments Trump was referencing, but he was likely responding to statements Harris made on CNN’s “State of the Union,” when she said she would “trust the word of public health experts and scientists” about a vaccine, “but not Donald Trump.”
In a clip of the interview, which was released on Sept. 6, Harris said she did not think scientists would get the “last word” on the efficacy of a vaccine.
“If past is prologue that they will not, they’ll be muzzled, they’ll be suppressed, they will be sidelined, because he’s looking at an election coming up in less than 60 days and he’s grasping for whatever he can get to pretend that he has been a leader on this issue when he is not,” Harris said.
Scientists in the administration have communicated with the public throughout the pandemic, although some media appearances have been limited and Politico reported a Trump adviser unsuccessfully attempted to alter messaging about the coronavirus.
Harris was then asked if she’d receive a vaccine that was approved and distributed before Nov. 3, Election Day.
“Well, I think that’s going to be an issue for all of us,” she replied. “I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump. And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about. I will not take his word for it.”
Later in the interview, Harris said that she would trust National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci to give an accurate assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine and agreed that at some point in the future there would hopefully be a safe and effective vaccine available. She also emphasized the need for a vaccine distribution plan.
Biden was asked on Labor Day whether he’d take a COVID-19 vaccine before the election. “I would want to see what the scientists said,” he replied. “I want full transparency on a vaccine. One of the problems is the way [Trump] is playing with politics. He’s said so many things that aren’t true, I’m worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. And so he’s undermining public confidence.”
“But pray God we have it,” Biden continued. “If I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I’d do it. If it cost me the election I’d do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now,” he said, adding, “But we have to listen to the scientists.”
The same day at a labor union virtual event, Biden also said he’d take a COVID-19 vaccine “[o]nly if it was completely transparent, that other experts in the country could look at it.”
Around the time Trump made his remarks at the rally, the Biden campaign released a statement that  outlined multiple ways the government should act to reassure Americans that any vaccine that receives authorization is safe and effective, including making the data publicly available along with statements from Fauci, the career Food and Drug Administration staff and relevant vaccine advisory committee.
The president can have his opinions on why his challengers made statements skeptical of a Trump-endorsed coronavirus shot, but it’s incorrect to suggest they do not support a coronavirus vaccine that has been fully vetted and properly approved.

Some scientists have expressed concerns similar to those of Biden and Harris about the FDA authorizing a vaccine before sufficient phase 3 data are available.

In June, University of Pennsylvania professors Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who is a coronavirus adviser to Biden campaign, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times warning that Trump might attempt an “October surprise” and release a vaccine prematurely to sway the election.
Other experts have published similar articles in which they call on the FDA — the agency that would be responsible for authorization of a vaccine — not to act too soon or cave to political pressure.
Offit told the New York Times in August that other scientists working within government shared his concerns, and he told us that he remained worried about politics influencing a COVID-19 vaccine approval.
He pointed to mounting international pressure and the FDA’s previous decisions during the coronavirus pandemic, including the agency’s emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine — which was subsequently revoked — and for convalescent plasma, which has yet to be shown to be safe and effective for COVID-19.
Of course, not all scientists are anxious that the government will authorize a vaccine without the necessary evidence. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us in June that he had faith in the FDA not to release an insufficiently tested vaccine — a sentiment he still holds — but he was nevertheless concerned about the White House’s emphasis on speed.
“The messaging coming out of the White House is extremely poor and detrimental,” he said, “so it’s actually fomenting distrust and creating a problem.”
Importantly, there are no signs that the administration will deviate from its plan to authorize a vaccine only after the necessary phase 3 trial data are in.
In Senate testimony on Sept. 9, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said, “I can’t say strongly enough that the decisions about how this vaccine is going to be evaluated and assessed is going to be based on science.” 
“Science and science alone will be the way in which this decision is made,” he added. “Otherwise, I’ll have no part of it.”
Fauci has made similar reassurances. He explained in a Sept. 3 CNN interview that the trials have independent data and safety monitoring boards that intermittently look at the data, and noted that the information would ultimately become public. “So I think that we can have some confidence and have faith in what the FDA is saying,” he said. “They’re saying very explicitly that they’re going to be making the decision based on the scientific data and we hope that that’s going to be the case.”
In an interview with Science, Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, said there had been “absolutely no interference” in the process so far and vowed to resign if that changed.
And on Sept. 8, the CEOs of all of the companies involved in the vaccines receiving U.S. governmental support pledged to make safety a “top priority” and only submit “for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities.”
Vaccine Under Other Administrations
Trump boasted of his unique ability to provide for a rapid coronavirus vaccine, saying in his Sept. 7 remarks that “if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn’t have it all.”
At the North Carolina rally the following day, he repeated the idea. “This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations,” he said. “We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.”
He has previously made similar claims, including at another North Carolina rally and in remarks throughout August.
It’s his opinion that he alone could pull off a vaccine in record time, but it’s premature to declare victory. And the idea that no other leader could do the same lacks support.
As we’ve explained before, the key idea behind Operation Warp Speed, which is to manufacture a vaccine before it’s known to work so that it can more quickly be distributed if it ends up being approved, is not new. It was done in 2009 for the H1N1 influenza vaccine. 
Although the effort this time is much larger, given the greater concern of the coronavirus pandemic, there’s no reason to think a different president would not have come up with a similar strategy, as other countries and organizations are using the same approach now.
Dr. Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response under Obama, noted that similar vaccine efforts were underway in other places around the world and that good progress was being made by companies that didn’t get involved with the U.S. government until recently.
“What the success is really due to is the success of science,” she said.
Lurie, who now advises the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19, said that previous investments in science and experiences from past administrations are what have allowed a fast response in these extraordinary circumstances.
“None of this response would have been possible without prior investments in science and technology,” she said.
One key realization after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, she said, was that existing vaccine technologies were simply too slow for pandemic situations. In 2010, the president’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology released a report recommending more investment and focusing on more rapid vaccine methods.   
After that report, Lurie said, there started to be investments, largely by NIH, to develop new vaccine platforms, which are bearing fruit today.
A New York Times article also explains that work underpinning Johnson & Johnson’s viral vector COVID-19 vaccine goes back more than a decade, including efforts to create a Zika vaccine before Trump came into office.
Collins, the NIH director, also noted during his Sept. 9 testimony on vaccines that the preparation effort has been decades in the making. “There were things that Congress had done over the past couple of decades, the creation of BARDA, other things that you’ve mentioned, that made it possible to move more swiftly now,” he said.
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, which is spearheading the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, was created by legislation President George W. Bush signed into law in 2006.
While Trump should get some credit for Operation Warp Speed, there’s no support for his claims that other administrations wouldn’t be able to achieve similar results.
Vaccine Trial Progress
Trump also exaggerated the progress of vaccine trials in his Labor Day press conference.
“If you talk to your sources in the FDA, you’ll see it’s going very, very well,” Trump told a reporter when being asked to elaborate on his comments on Biden and Harris. “The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.”
Later, he continued: “You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we’re going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.”
No vaccine company has yet reached its enrollment goal of 30,000 participants for its phase 3 trial, although one is close. 
As of Sept. 7 — the day Trump made his remarks — Pfizer/BioNTech had enrolled 25,189 volunteers in 39 states, and Brazil and Argentina. 
As of Sept. 4, Moderna had enrolled 21,411 participants, all within the U.S. That day, the CEO said the company wanted to increase minority participation in the trial, even if that meant slower recruitment.
The third company currently performing a phase 3 trial in the U.S., AstraZeneca, began a trial in America on Aug. 31, but has not yet started recruitment. On Sept. 8, the company put its trial on hold to investigate a potential adverse reaction in a U.K. woman.
Although the idea is to test multiple candidates to make it more likely that at least one vaccine will prove successful, there is no guarantee that any of the vaccines being tested will work, despite Trump’s claim that there will be “a good result, one way or the other, very soon.”
It’s unclear whether Trump means enrollment figures or trial data when he said the “numbers are looking unbelievably strong.” We asked the White House for clarification, but did not hear back. 
Since the studies are double-blind, neither the president nor anyone within the companies or the FDA knows how well the vaccine is performing in the phase 3 trials so far. The only people privy to that information are those on the data and safety monitoring boards.
Vaccine Timing
During the Labor Day presser, Trump argued with a reporter about his past statements on when to expect a vaccine, saying that he said “by the end of the year,” not that there “will” be a vaccine earlier.
“I didn’t say what you said,” Trump insisted. “What I said is ‘by the end of the year.’ But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.”
We looked through Trump’s past comments on a vaccine, and did not find any cases in which he declared a vaccine would definitely be available by October or November. But he has suggested that the earlier time frame is even more likely. Experts and governmental officials disagree with that assessment.
Since May, Trump has been saying a vaccine will be ready “very soon,” usually without specifying what that means. But at a press briefing on Sept. 4, Trump suggested that a vaccine was probable by October. 
“We remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1st,” he said. “We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October.”
That evening at a rally in North Carolina, Trump was even more explicit. “It’ll be delivered, the vaccine, before the end of the year and frankly, maybe even during the month of October. I think October is even more likely.”
In August, the president also said that he thought it was likely a vaccine would be ready around Nov. 3. “I’m optimistic that it’ll be probably around that date,” he said. “I believe we’ll have the vaccine before the end of the year certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so.”
Even in his comments on Labor Day, Trump focused on the earlier dates, mentioning them more frequently than the end of 2020. “[I]t’s going to be done in a very short of period of time,” he said. “Could even have it during the month of October.”
“So we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date,” he said at another point, referring to the election. “You know what date I’m talking about.”
Experts disagree with Trump’s rosiest predictions. In an interview with PBS on Sept. 8, Fauci said it was “unlikely” a vaccine would be available by Election Day, and that an answer about how well a vaccine works is “more likely by the end of the year.”
“I do have cautious optimism that by the end of 2020, at least one of these vaccines will have emerged and turned out to be safe and effective,” NIH head Collins said in his Sept. 9 congressional testimony. “But even that is a guess. And certainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week, before or after a particular date in early November, is well beyond anything that any scientists right now could tell you and be confident that they know what they’re saying.”
The CEO of Pfizer also clarified his earlier statement that he expected to know whether his vaccine works by the end of October, explaining on NBC’s “Today” on Sept. 8 that the time frame was not the same as having shots ready to go into people’s arms.
“Right now, our model, our base case, predicts that we will have an answer by the end of October. Of course, this is only a prediction,” he said. “And that is only an answer.”
Slaoui, the Operation Warp Speed adviser, told NPR on Sept. 3 that there was a “very, very low” chance that the trials would provide results by the end of October. Instead, he suggested, it was more realistic to think there would be a limited number of vaccine doses for high-risk groups available by the end of the year, ramping up to cover the rest of the population by the middle of 2021.

229,Biden’s Early Statements About the Coronavirus,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/bidens-early-statements-about-the-coronavirus/,,"President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have made competing claims about Biden’s early statements on the coronavirus.
Following the disclosure of comments he made to journalist Bob Woodward in March about downplaying the coronavirus, Trump has tried to turn the tables on Biden, claiming it was Biden who maintained through late February that the coronavirus was “not even going to be a problem.” That’s not accurate.
The former vice president warned early about the potential danger posed by the virus, and about the need for a thoughtful response by the federal government. The “coronavirus is a serious public health challenge,” Biden said at a Feb. 28 campaign rally in South Carolina.
Conversely, Biden stretched the facts at a CNN town hall on Sept. 17, claiming that in January he wrote an op-ed “saying, we’ve got a pandemic. We’ve got a real problem.” The op-ed did not go that far. 
We reviewed all of Biden’s public comments that we could find in early 2020 about the coronavirus.  While some of his comments about the potential danger of the virus have proved prescient, Biden was not as far ahead of the curve as he sometimes makes it seem when it came to calls for deterrents like social distancing and wearing masks.
We start with one comment from Biden via Twitter from October 2019, before the coronavirus emerged.

We are not prepared for a pandemic. Trump has rolled back progress President Obama and I made to strengthen global health security. We need leadership that builds public trust, focuses on real threats, and mobilizes the world to stop outbreaks before they reach our shores. https://t.co/1qqpgayUEX
— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 25, 2019

That was more than a month before the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, China, and more than two months before Chinese officials  reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.
Sounding the Alarm
The first public statement that we found from Biden about the coronavirus came in an op-ed for USA Today on Jan. 27. In it, he warned about the “possibility of a pandemic,” writing that while there were only five confirmed cases in the U.S. at that time, “There will likely be more.”
Biden argued that “Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge.” Biden touted the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak, and he criticized Trump for proposing budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for International Development (although Congress did not enact those proposed cuts).
That puts Biden on record as sounding an early warning about the coronavirus. But Biden went too far with comments at the CNN town hall when he said he warned in the op-ed, “We’ve got a pandemic. We’ve got a real problem.”
Biden was responding to recently revealed comments Trump made to Woodward on Feb. 7 acknowledging the coronavirus was “deadly stuff,” adding that it might be five times more lethal than the flu.
Trump “knew the detail of it,” Biden said. “He knew it in clear term. Imagine had he at the State of the Union [on Feb. 4] stood up and said, when back in January, I wrote an article for USA Today saying, we’ve got a pandemic. We’ve got a real problem. Imagine if he had said something. How many more people would be alive?”
But as we’ve written, Biden didn’t say in the op-ed that the outbreak was already a pandemic. He said it was a “possibility.” He said Trump was not prepared to lead the country through a “global health challenge,” which Biden did predict would “get worse before it gets better.” (The World Health Organization didn’t declare COVID-19 a pandemic until  March 11.) In fact, a month after that op-ed, Biden still said it wasn’t yet a pandemic. “Folks, we can beat this virus. We can keep it from being a pandemic,” Biden said at a a campaign rally on Feb. 28. “But it takes a lot of work.”
Four days after Biden’s op-ed, on Jan. 31, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency for the novel coronavirus and announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S. But there were exceptions for permanent residents and the immediate family members of both U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
That same day, at a campaign event in Fort Madison, Iowa, Biden said, “We have right now a crisis with the coronavirus,” and warned that Trump was not a leader up to the challenge.
Biden, Jan. 31: America needs a president they can trust, especially at times of a crisis. You know, we have right now a crisis with the coronavirus, emanating from China. A national emergency, you know, worldwide alerts. The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. In moments like this, this is where the credibility of a president is most needed, as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.
(Trump has repeatedly cited the “xenophobia” comment as evidence that Biden opposed his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. The Biden campaign on April 3 said Biden supported the travel restrictions, and that the xenophobia comment was unrelated to them.)
The following day, Biden tweeted: “We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus.” And he warned Trump was “the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.”
Biden made nearly identical comments that day at a rally in North Liberty, Iowa.
Biden said Trump had a credibility problem with the American people, who are “finding it harder and harder to believe what he says about this virus. Look, president’s words matter. They matter, no matter who the president is. And in times of fear and concern, people need to have confidence in the word of a president. And, you know, this president, he has a trust deficit that is compounded by his record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering.”
In both rallies, Biden accused Trump of proposing “draconian” cuts to the NIH, CDC and U.S. Agency for International Development — which, as we said, Congress ignored.
In some 35 public appearances at campaign rallies, in television interviews or in Democratic debates over the next three weeks in February, Biden was not asked about and did not mention the coronavirus at all.
The issue next came up during a Democratic debate on Feb. 25. With the virus reaching a turning point, as the CDC warned schools they should prepare and might have to close, Biden was asked what he would do. Biden again talked about the Obama administration’s response to Ebola in the context of what he would do now: set up a White House office for pandemic response and increase funding for the CDC and NIH. And Biden said he would insist that China allow American scientists in to “know what’s going on.”
At a press briefing the following day, Feb. 26, Trump made several comments that suggested the U.S. had the coronavirus well under control.
“So we’re at the low level,” Trump said. “As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.”
Trump insisted that “we’re going very substantially down, not up” in the number of cases, that “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”
In a CNN town hall that night, Biden said Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did not appear to be on the same page.
Biden called the virus “a concern” and said, “I think it’s important that we understand that you have to have a president in charge. … We need to invest immediately. We should have done it from the beginning, the moment the virus appeared. But we’re getting late, but we’ve got good scientists. And I just hope the president gets on the same page as the scientists.”
The Bogus Case that Biden Played Down the Coronavirus
Earlier this month, a new book by Woodward revealed that on March 19, Trump told Woodward that he had understated the threat of coronavirus on purpose. “I wanted to always play it down,” he said, adding, “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”
In recent interviews, Trump has tried to suggest that it was Biden who downplayed the coronavirus.
In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Sept. 9, Trump claimed that Biden “was going around for many, many weeks” after the travel restrictions on China were announced on Jan. 31, “saying, it’s not even going to be a problem. … And they were all going around, no problem, no problem, everybody, practically everybody. Nobody had any idea it would be as violent as it turned out to be.” Later, Trump said Biden “didn’t think it was going to be a problem until months later. He was way late.“
At a White House briefing the following day, Trump again claimed that for months after he imposed the China travel restrictions, Biden “said there’s no problem.”
At the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump again claimed that as late as March, Biden was calling the coronavirus “totally over exaggerated.”
As we said, that is belied by Biden’s repeated warnings, starting with the op-ed on Jan. 27, that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic, and would require a sustained and strong federal response.
The Trump campaign said the president’s comment refers to statements Biden made on Feb. 28 that it was not a time to panic. (Trump told Woodward that he played down the virus because he didn’t want to create a panic.)
The first was at a campaign rally in Sumter, South Carolina.
Biden, Feb. 28: I want to talk a moment about the coronavirus. And I just want to say a few things to set the record straight. Barack and I, as president and vice president, we took on the virus that was threatening all of Africa and the rest of the world, and we set up a mechanism that worked. But I want to take a moment to say, it’s not a time to panic about coronavirus, but coronavirus is a serious public health challenge.
Biden did say it was not a time to panic, but he never downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus threat, as Trump suggests. To the contrary, he claimed moments later that that’s what Trump was trying to do.
“Trump thought that his upbeat tweets could somehow stop the coronavirus,” Biden said. “Well I have news for Donald Trump, like the rest of us, this virus is not impressed by his tweets. And here’s the point, and I’m being deadly earnest about this, we need real action in the White House, not more lies. It’s no surprise that the president who thinks that climate change is a hoax also thinks that coronavirus is a conspiracy. We need a president who stands for the truth over fiction, and facts and science over fiction. Folks, we can beat this virus. We can keep it from being a pandemic. But it takes a lot of work.”
At a campaign event in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the same day, Biden again said “there should be no panic about this.” But he didn’t downplay the virus, or say that it was “not even going to be a problem” or that it was “totally over exaggerated,” as Trump claimed. (Starting at the 105:20 mark.)
“There should be just the straight facts laid out for people and now that’s not happening,” Biden said. “Hopefully the pressure is building on the president to step aside. He knows nothing about much. He knows nothing about this issue. Let science dictate the outcome,what we do. That’s what I’d be doing.”
That’s different from what Trump was saying at the time. As we recently learned, Trump admitted he was purposefully downplaying the virus.
Interestingly, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on March 24, five days after Trump made his comments to Woodward about downplaying the virus, Biden said this: “The American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their county down when given an opportunity to respond. And we just have to level with them. They’re tough. They’re smart. They can handle it. But give them the facts. The only thing that’s going to make things worse, if we, in fact, don’t give them the facts, and then things turn out to be bad. Then who do they believe? What is there to believe? They can handle whatever comes their way.”
Social Distancing and Masks
While Biden may have been earlier than many in warning about the potential seriousness of a pandemic, he and his campaign have occasionally made comments that suggest he was further ahead of the curve than he was on things like social distancing and wearing masks.
For example, in a TV interview in Florida on Sept. 15, when asked how he would handle a new surge in the coronavirus, Biden said, in part, “I would be setting the example that I’ve tried to set since this began, of being responsible, wearing a mask.” (Starting at the 1:46 mark.)
Another example is a radio interview in May when Biden talked about a Columbia University study that concluded tens of thousands of deaths would have been avoided if social distancing and other enforcement measures, such as stay-at-home orders, had been widely implemented in the U.S. a week or two earlier. “They pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead,” Biden said.
At the Sept. 17 CNN town hall, Biden again cited the Columbia study and claimed that “all the way back in March, I was calling for the need for us to have masks.”
As we wrote back in May, we couldn’t find any examples of Biden calling for social distancing, or something resembling a nationwide lockdown, by early March. 
In fact, Biden was still holding campaign rallies with large groups of people at that point. On March 9, he spoke at a crowded campaign event in Detroit. (Trump’s last public event around that period was a Fox News town hall on March 5.)
On March 12, Biden released “The Biden Plan to Combat Coronavirus.” It made no mention of public mask-wearing. It called for the CDC to provide clarity to the general public “about when to move toward social distancing measures, like cancelling school, mass gatherings, and travel and when to move to tele-work and distance learning models.”
In comments posted the same day to Medium, Biden said that while the coronavirus would require a national response, it would also require individuals to “take appropriate precautions — to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease.”
“It will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings,” Biden said.
The same day, the Biden campaign issued a memo to staff instructing all campaign staffers to work from home, beginning March 14.
On March 16, Trump issued the 15-day “Coronavirus Guidelines for America,” in which he urged, “all Americans, including the young and healthy, [to] work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.”
On ABC’s “This Week” on Sept. 13, host George Stephanopoulos noted that in Biden’s op-ed in late January, “he didn’t explicitly call for travel bans or social distancing or wearing mask.”
Biden campaign Senior Adviser Symone Sanders responded that Biden “was not being briefed by national security experts who warned him how deadly the virus was. In January and February, Joe Biden did not have the knowledge that President Trump did.”
“But I will tell you that if Joe Biden were president in January or February, he would have taken proper precautions he would have warned the American people,” Sanders said. “He would have told folks to social distance. He would model good behavior and wearing a mask.”
We don’t know what national security experts may have been privately telling the president about the coronavirus back in January or February. (It was revealed in April that Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, wrote a memo in late January advising federal officials that the global outbreak could become a pandemic and that more than half a million Americans could die in multiple scenarios.)
But in public statements, Fauci has said Trump did listen to health experts. On April 13, Fauci said that when he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, approached Trump about directing strong mitigation, the president’s response was, “Yes, we’ll do it.”
In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci said that “right now at this moment” the risk from the coronavirus was “low” and there was “no need” for people “to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis.” But he added that “this could change,” that people needed to be wary of “community spread,” and that it could develop into a “major outbreak.”
In February and March, health experts such as Fauci and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams were still telling the general public not to wear face masks. As late as March 30, the World Health Organization was recommending that healthy people should not wear masks. There was a concern among those health officials at that time that there would not be enough masks available for health care workers.
However, as health officials learned more about the virus, and how often it was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, the CDC reversed course on April 3 and began recommending that people wear masks in public.
We couldn’t find any instances of Biden “all the way back in March … calling for the need for us to have masks,” as he claimed.
The Biden campaign noted that in a press call on March 20, Biden said that when staffers met with him in person, “We’re following CDC guidelines. People are coming in with masks on, wearing gloves.” And in an interview on March 24, CNN’s Tapper asked Biden how he was keeping himself safe, given that older people are more adversely affected by the coronavirus. Biden responded, in part, “I’m just following the instructions that — and anybody who walks into the house from the Secret Service on, they’re wearing masks and gloves.”
But that’s not the same as a call for the general public to wear masks.
The Biden camp also points to Biden’s repeated calls in late March for Trump to ramp up the Defense Production Act, and specifically mentioned masks as a critical need. But in those instances, Biden was calling for the need to increase the number of masks available to medical workers to treat those with COVID-19, not for mass public use.
Fauci in late March said the coronavirus task force was discussing whether to advise all Americans to wear masks in public. In a press conference on March 30, Trump was asked about the possibility of such federal guidance, and he said, “We’re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time.” And as we said, the CDC made that recommendation several days later, on April 3.
Although Biden was stretching the facts when he said he has advocated public mask-wearing “since this began,” he has been a strong advocate since health officials like those at the CDC began recommending it — standing in contrast to Trump, who on the day the CDC issued its guidance, announced, “I won’t be doing it personally. It’s a recommendation.”
Two days later, on ABC’s “This Week” on April 5, Biden had a very different response when asked if he’d be wearing a mask in public.
“Yes,” Biden said. “Look, I think it’s important to follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you. It’s, you know, you may not look — he may not like how he looks in a mask, but the truth of the matter is that follow the science, that’s what they’re telling us.”
And, of course, the stance taken by the political rivals has sharply contrasted since.
On April 29, Biden tweeted, “Wear a mask in public.” And Biden wore a mask on May 25 in his first public appearance in two months. Since then, he has worn a mask in public appearances, and has not held in-person campaign rallies.
By comparison, it wasn’t until July 20 that Trump tweeted a photo of himself wearing a mask. But he has remained inconsistent in his advocacy for mask-wearing. In the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump noted that health experts working for the government initially “talked about don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks. Although some people say don’t wear masks.”
Trump said that he wears a mask “when I have to and when I’m in hospitals and other locations.” But he added, “Now there is by the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good.” Asked who, Trump gave the example of waiters.
And, of course, Trump has held several rallies with no social distancing, and few attendees wearing masks — including two rallies that were held indoors.
At an outdoor rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in early September, Trump asked a densely packed, mostly mask-less audience if they knew “a man that likes a mask as much” as Biden.

“It gives him a feeling of security,” the president said. “If I were a psychiatrist, right? I’d say, ‘This guy’s got some big issues.'”

At a White House briefing the following day, Trump again claimed that for months after he imposed the China travel restrictions, Biden “said there’s no problem.”
At the ABC News town hall on Sept. 15, Trump again claimed that as late as March, Biden was calling the coronavirus “totally over exaggerated.”
As we said, that is belied by Biden’s repeated warnings, starting with the op-ed on Jan. 27, that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic, and would require a sustained and strong federal response. So we’ve had very good luck.”
Trump insisted that “we’re going very substantially down, not up” in the number of cases, that “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”
In a CNN town hall that night, Biden said Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did not appear to be on the same page. For example, in a TV interview in Florida on Sept. 15, when asked how he would handle a new surge in the coronavirus, Biden said, in part, “I would be setting the example that I’ve tried to set since this began, of being responsible, wearing a mask.” (Starting at the 1:46 mark.) And, you know, this president, he has a trust deficit that is compounded by his record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering.”
In both rallies, Biden accused Trump of proposing “draconian” cuts to the NIH, CDC and U.S. Agency for International Development — which, as we said, Congress ignored. But it takes a lot of work.”
At a campaign event in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the same day, Biden again said “there should be no panic about this.” But he didn’t downplay the virus, or say that it was “not even going to be a problem” or that it was “totally over exaggerated,” as Trump claimed."
230,Biden Exaggerates CDC Cuts in China,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/biden-exaggerates-cdc-cuts-in-china/,,"Former Vice President Joe Biden overstated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s staffing cuts in China during the Trump administration. He said the CDC reduced its staff to four, but it was actually 14.
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee made his remarks on MSNBC’s “The Last Word.”
Biden, May 14: We had over 44, if I’m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them and I think left only four in place.
He is mistaken.
The Biden campaign confirmed that the former vice president was referring to a March 25 Reuters report that said the Trump administration had cut CDC’s staff in Beijing by more than two-thirds.
But that story said CDC’s staff in China “has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017,” citing CDC documents. 
So how did Biden get to four?
The documents cited by Reuters provided a breakdown of CDC’s workers by Americans and Chinese nationals. The documents show that most of the CDC staffers let go were Chinese nationals — contrary to Biden’s claim that President Donald Trump had “brought home the vast majority of them.”
“The biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the U.S. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period,” Reuters reported.
The Reuters story said the Chinese nationals let go included “medical and disease experts” with “deep expertise and institutional knowledge.”
There were only eight Americans assigned to the CDC’s Beijing office, and that number was reduced to three at the start of the Trump administration, increasing to four with the recent arrival of a deputy director, Reuters had reported.
The Biden campaign told us that its candidate was referring to the total number of CDC workers at the start of the Trump administration and the number of Americans who remained after the cuts. But he’s misrepresenting the staffing levels by comparing a total headcount that includes the Chinese nationals with a smaller, post-reduction number that does not.
It would be accurate if Biden had said that Trump had cut CDC staff in Beijing from eight to four Americans or that the president reduced the agency’s total staff from 47 to 14. But he’s wrong to say the staffing level was cut from 47 (or “over 44”) to four.
Update, May 22: In an email on May 19, the CDC provided our friends at PolitiFact with a further breakdown of the agency’s staffing levels in China. The CDC email, which PolitiFact shared with us, showed the overall number of CDC employees in China declined from 44 in March 2017 to 14 in March 2020. Specifically, the CDC cut its staff from 14 to five during that time in the Division of Global Health Protection — which is charged with helping “to stop potential pandemics at the source,” according to the CDC website. None of the five CDC employees in the global health division in China were Americans.

231,Trump’s Faulty Malaria-Coronavirus Connection,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-faulty-malaria-coronavirus-connection/,,"Falsely citing “studies,” President Donald Trump has suggested that there are few novel coronavirus cases in “malaria countries” because of the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine. But no such studies exist, and the drug is not widely used for malaria in much of the world.
Trump has aggressively promoted hydroxychloroquine for weeks, despite limited evidence at this point that it is safe or effective to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And he has latched on to indications it could be working — even if the basic facts undermine his argument.
“It is extremely unlikely that relatively low rates of the [coronavirus] infection in sub-Saharan Africa are related to the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,” Michigan State University malaria researcher Terrie Taylor told us, also referring to a similar malaria drug Trump has pushed as a COVID-19 treatment. “Neither has been the first-line treatment for malaria illness for many years.”
Trump first suggested hydroxychloroquine was behind other nations’ low COVID-19 counts in a March 23 coronavirus press briefing. “And countries with malaria have had a interesting thing happen,” he said. “They take this particular drug — it’s a very powerful drug — and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries. And there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the malaria.”
He broached the idea again in another press briefing on April 4 after falsely claiming that “people with lupus,”  who also take hydroxychloroquine to treat symptoms of their disease, “aren’t catching this horrible virus.”
As we have written, it’s not yet known whether lupus patients taking the drug are less susceptible to infection with the new virus. But it’s clear that being on the drug is not a panacea. Registry data from early April show that a quarter of patients with rheumatic diseases who have contracted COVID-19 were already taking hydroxychloroquine.
Trump, April 4: And there’s also other studies, you know, with the malaria, that the malaria countries have very little — people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria — that those countries have very little of this virus. I don’t know. You’re going to check it out.
As we did with Trump’s lupus remarks, we did check it out. We could find no studies that back his claim, and experts we consulted were also unaware of any such studies. The White House did not respond to our request for more information.
Sub-Saharan Africa
It’s nevertheless true that many countries where malaria is common, including much of sub-Saharan Africa, haven’t reported a lot of COVID-19 cases — at least not yet. 
Global tallies from the World Health Organization show that the day Trump made his latest remarks, the African region had fewer than 5,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and only 170 deaths, out of more than 1 million cases and nearly 57,000 deaths worldwide. As of April 8, the count had risen to more than 7,600 cases and 326 deaths.
Malaria, which is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, occurs in other places, dictated in large part by climate and season. But as the WHO says, the African region has a “disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden,” including 93% of all cases and 94% of deaths in 2018. On April 4, only 680 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the six African nations that collectively account for more than half of the world’s malaria cases.
There’s little reason, however, to think that’s because of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, for the simple fact that few people in malaria-prone countries are taking the drugs.
Chloroquine was once the go-to drug for malaria treatment in Africa, Taylor explained, but is no longer because the malaria parasite evolved and developed resistance to the drug. Hydroxychloroquine, which is a slightly modified version of chloroquine that is generally considered to be safer, suffers from the same problem; Taylor said it never has been a first-line malaria treatment in Africa.
“WHO and the various national malaria control programmes across the continent all recommend artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for the first line treatment of uncomplicated malaria,” Taylor said in an email from Malawi, a small landlocked country in southeastern Africa. “There are a number of different approved combination drugs, and each country has made its own policy recommendations — but no African country recommends that malaria patients receive chloroquine now.”
Chloroquine, she added, “has virtually disappeared from many of these countries.”
In Malawi, where Taylor is doing research, getting chloroquine is “actually quite difficult,” she said, because it’s been withdrawn from the national formulary and is “only available by special request.”
Miriam Laufer, a malaria researcher and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland, told us that chloroquine is “still available in the private sector in some countries, like Nigeria, but it is not used routinely for treatment of malaria and is not part of national treatment policies.” 
Laufer agreed with Taylor that it would be extremely unlikely that the low numbers of COVID-19 cases in sub-Saharan Africa would be due to the use of these drugs.
Where Chloroquine Is Used
Ric Price, a professor of global health at the Menzies School of Health Research in Australia, also told us it was “highly implausible” that antimalarials were responsible for the lower COVID-19 counts in countries with malaria. 
“You would have to have enough of the population being treated for malaria,” he said in an email, “and residual levels of the drug staying in the blood for weeks to provide protection against the virus.”
While chloroquine is still used to treat malaria in some countries to target a different species of parasite that largely remains sensitive to the drug, Price said only a tiny fraction of the populations in those countries would be on the medication for malaria treatment — and “almost no one” would be taking drugs for prevention.
Price calculated that at best, less than 0.5% of those populations would have taken chloroquine at some point in the past year.
Then there is the issue of timing and dosing of chloroquine. “It hangs around for a few weeks in blood,” Price said, “but will only provide protection from malaria for a week (max 4 weeks).” 
Even if chloroquine is effective against COVID-19, far fewer than 0.5% of the population would have taken the drug at the right time to be protected. And as Price noted, lab studies suggest that compared with malaria, much more of the drug is needed to have any effect on the virus, so the amounts people might have taken are “highly unlikely to have any impact.”
The WHO also has cautioned that the dosages for malaria are different than those being explored for COVID-19. 
“In the context of the COVID-19 response, the dosage and treatment schedules for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that are currently under consideration do not reflect those used for treating patients with malaria,” the WHO website says. “The ingestion of high doses of these medicines may be associated with adverse or seriously adverse health outcomes.”
Other Reasons For Few Cases
Finally, while current maps of the coronavirus pandemic might make it look like much of Africa is escaping relatively unscathed, many are bracing for a surge. 
“I’m pretty confident that COVID-19 is going to become an important epidemic in Africa,” said Peter Hotez, a professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in a phone interview. “It’s just that there hasn’t been much monitoring and testing.”
Price also suspects testing will be a problem. “I very much doubt we will see any of the real picture of Covid19 in poor malaria endemic countries,” he said, “because they will be testing a tiny fraction of [the] number.”
The WHO, which has been worried since the start of the outbreak about the damage the virus might inflict on Africa’s weaker health systems, issued a press release on April 7 noting that the virus “was slow to reach the continent compared to other parts of the world,” but that “infection has grown exponentially in recent weeks and continues to spread.” The continent’s first case was identified on Feb. 14 in Egypt, nearly a month after the first U.S. case.
The dearth of cases — if in fact real, and not due to a lack of testing — could stem from a variety of factors, including differences in international travel or possibly even the climate. 
As we’ve previously explained, there is some precedent for virus transmission to wane as it becomes hotter and more humid, although it’s not known yet if this applies to the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. A recent summary of the latest research on the topic from the National Academies of Sciences notes that in the lab, SARS-CoV-2 seems to survive less well under higher temperatures and humidity levels, but it’s less clear whether that has any impact on virus transmission in the real world — and countries currently in “summer” climates have still seen the virus spread. 
If climate does turn out to be important for this virus, the very conditions that allow malaria to flourish could help limit the extent of the outbreak in certain countries.
Experts, however, caution against coming to any premature conclusions. “The potential explanations for why sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind other countries vis-a-vis COVID19 are fueling LOTS of conversations and speculation,” said Taylor.

232,Outdated Fauci Video on Face Masks Shared Out of Context,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/outdated-fauci-video-on-face-masks-shared-out-of-context/,,"Quick Take
An outdated video clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci is circulating on social media — giving the false impression he is currently advising the public not to wear face masks. Fauci, like other health officials, recommends wearing a cloth face covering when distances of at least six feet can’t be maintained.
Full Story
On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its earlier position on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic and announced that it was now recommending that people should wear face coverings in public, citing new studies on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.
“We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (‘asymptomatic’) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (‘pre-symptomatic’) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms,” the CDC said in its announcement. “In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”
Despite the new guidance, dubious Facebook pages and groups — some of which advocate alternative medicines, conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination messages — have been recently circulating an outdated recommendation on the use of face masks. The pages are sharing a March 8 video clip from CBS’ “60 Minutes” showing Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying: “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.”
But at that point in early March, the CDC recommended conserving face masks, which were in short supply, for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. So, Fauci gave an answer that was in line with CDC recommendations at that time.
Here’s what Fauci told Dr. Jon LaPook, chief medical correspondent for CBS News, in the clip circulating on social media:
LaPook, March 8: There’s a lot of confusion among people, and misinformation, surrounding face masks. Can you discuss that?
Fauci: The masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else… Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.
LaPook: You’re sure of it? Because people are listening really closely to this.
Fauci: …There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.
LaPook: And can you get some schmutz, sort of staying inside there?
Fauci: Of course, of course. But, when you think masks, you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill. The people who, when you look at the films of foreign countries and you see 85% of the people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m not against it. If you want to do it, that’s fine.
LaPook: But it can lead to a shortage of masks?
Fauci: Exactly, that’s the point. It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.
Since then, the science around the novel coronavirus has evolved, Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, explained in an interview with FactCheck.org.
In early March, so few patients had been tested that public health officials didn’t yet know that people could spread the virus without showing symptoms, said Winslow.
“That was just not known at that point,” he said.
Winslow noted that Fauci appeared to be making two points in the interview. He was pushing back on the idea that a mask could protect the wearer from infection, and he was emphasizing the importance of other measures, such as maintaining a distance of at least six feet between people.
Both of those things still apply, according to the CDC, which explains on its website that the point of wearing a mask “is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms.”
In appearances aired on PBS NewsHour on April 3 and May 12, Fauci again noted the importance of physical distancing and, in line with the evolving public health recommendations, added that cloth face coverings should be used in public.
But the Facebook pages didn’t share the more up-to-date interviews. Instead, they shared the old interview without noting the date.
For example, a Facebook page that supports the widely debunked conspiracy-theory video, “Plandemic,” shared the old clip on May 6 with the caption, “Dr. Anthony Fauci: ‘There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.'” That’s the opposite of the advice Fauci was giving by that time.

233,Trump’s Premature Claim about Ventilator Production,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-premature-claim-about-ventilator-production/,,"In a March 21 press briefing, President Donald Trump prematurely declared that automakers, including Ford and General Motors, were manufacturing much needed ventilators “right now.”
It wasn’t until nearly a week after the president’s claim that General Motors and Ventec Life Systems announced that the car company would begin retooling its manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, to make “critical care ventilators” that could be ready to “ship as soon as next month.”
Prior to that, GM had been working to produce or procure parts for Ventec to increase Ventec’s output of ventilators, and GM was only “exploring the feasibility to build ventilators” at one of its own facilities, a company spokesman told us.
The CEO of Ford, meanwhile, has said recently that it could be May or June before Ford, which is partnering with another company that makes the lifesaving machines, begins to produce them in mass.
The collaborations between the car makers and the medical device manufacturers came about as governors and health officials around the country have said that hospitals do not have enough ventilators for patients with COVID-19, which affects the respiratory system and can make it difficult for patients to breathe on their own.
Many politicians have called on Trump to use the full force of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which gives the president the authority to compel private businesses in the U.S. to ramp up the production of necessary supplies during a national emergency. In addition to ventilators, hospitals treating an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are also reportedly lacking essential supplies including respirators and protective gear, such as masks, gloves and gowns.
But Trump has said that he has not needed to rely on the Defense Production Act because several companies have volunteered to help. And he has sometimes given the impression that car companies, in particular, have already started producing ventilators.
In a March 21 press briefing with members of the White House coronavirus task force, for example, Trump said that GM and Ford were making ventilators “right now.”
Trump, March 21: You know, a ventilator is a machine. It’s a very complex machine. And to think that we have to order hundreds of thousands — nobody has ever heard of a thing like this. … With that being said, General Motors, Ford, so many companies — I had three calls yesterday directly. Without having to institute — like, “You will do this” — these companies are making them right now. But to think of these numbers, it’s pretty — it’s pretty mindboggling.
The following day, on Twitter, the president wrote: “Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?”
Trump’s tweet may have been a reference to the Food and Drug Administration recently deciding to temporarily relax some of the rules that companies have to follow when producing ventilators and other medical supplies. The FDA said the guidance was intended to “provide a policy to help expand the availability of ventilators as well as other respiratory devices and their accessories during this pandemic.”
But Ford and GM have not started making ventilators yet, and just how “fast” they may be able to do so in the future remains to be seen.
General Motors
On March 20, GM announced that it would be helping Ventec Life Systems increase production of Ventec’s ventilators. “Ventec will leverage GM’s logistics, purchasing and manufacturing expertise to build more of their critically important ventilators,” the companies said in a joint statement. 
When asked if GM was already producing ventilators, a spokesman, Dan Flores, provided us with another joint statement that said: “Ventec Life Systems and General Motors have been working around the clock to implement plans to build more critical care ventilators. With GM’s support, Ventec is now planning exponentially higher ventilator production as fast as possible.”
The statement also said: “As part of those efforts, GM is exploring the feasibility to build ventilators for Ventec at a GM facility in Kokomo, Indiana.”
On March 23, Reuters reported: “As part of the effort to boost ventilator output from Ventec, GM has arranged for the supply of 95% of the parts needed to build the ventilator and is seeking to source the remaining 37 necessary parts, according to an email to suppliers from Shilpan Amin, GM’s vice president of global purchasing.”
The Reuters story added: “First parts need to be delivered by suppliers to GM by April 6, the sources said. Supplier production could begin ‘within the next 2-3 weeks,’ Amin said in his email. It was not clear when GM might begin production.”
But on March 27, GM and Ventec announced that GM would, in fact, soon be manufacturing ventilators.
“Ventec Life Systems announced today General Motors will build VOCSN critical care ventilators at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana manufacturing facility with FDA-cleared ventilators scheduled to ship as soon as next month,” GM said in a statement. “This effort is in addition to Ventec taking aggressive steps to ramp up production at their manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington.”
The statement continued: “Efforts to set up tooling and manufacturing capacity at the GM Kokomo facility are already underway to produce Ventec’s critical care ventilator, VOCSN. Depending on the needs of the federal government, Ventec and GM are poised to deliver the first ventilators next month and ramp up to a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with the infrastructure and capability to scale further.”
After that announcement, Trump lashed out at GM on Twitter, saying that “late April” isn’t soon enough and that GM must “START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW.”
Trump also then invoked the Defense Production Act to force GM to make them.
Ford
Ford, on the other hand, announced on March 24 that it would be working with GE Healthcare, which also manufactures ventilators. 
“Ford and GE Healthcare are working together to expand production of a simplified version of GE Healthcare’s existing ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by COVID-19,” Ford said in a statement. “These ventilators could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location.”
In an interview, a Ford spokesman, Mike Levine, told us that the company did not have any information to share about a timeline. He simply said Ford is working on this “as quickly as possible.”
Levine said “it’s possible we will take on some of the manufacturing ourselves,” and added that Ford is in talks with GE Healthcare to see how it would be able to do that.
But Ford’s president and CEO, Jim Hackett, already has said in interviews that it could be more than a month before the company starts producing a product.
For instance, he told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota that it may take until well into May for Ford and other producers worldwide to be making “hundreds of thousands of ventilators”:
Camerota, March 24: And just — I mean, is there any way to give me a timeline? I mean, doctors say they need them now. Do you know how quickly —
Hackett: Yes, yes — sorry —
Camerota: — you can make them?
Hackett: Yes, there’s no higher sense of urgency. The biggest issue, for example talking to the U.K. last night, is there are six hours of testing at the end of this. You actually have to run the ventilator through a complete cycle to make sure there’s no part of it that fails. It normally takes about 27 hours to make a ventilator. We think we can cut that in half. And I would say to you that the — at scale, by the — by the middle of May, we could be making hundreds of thousands of these ventilators.
Camerota: I’m sorry, hundreds of thousands, how often?
Hackett: I’m saying that by — you have to scale this up, so I’m saying by early May, we could — you could see, across the world, hundreds of thousands of ventilators being built from multiple suppliers, not just Ford Motor Company. 
And in interviews with NPR and CBS’ “This Morning,” Hackett said it could take until June for Ford and other companies to scale up production to the rate needed.
Meanwhile, GE Healthcare says it has “doubled its capacity of ventilator production and has plans to double it again by end of Q2 2020 to address unprecedented demand – independent of the collaboration with Ford.”

As for Tesla, which Trump also has mentioned, the electric car and clean energy company’s CEO, Elon Musk, wrote on Twitter recently that he “had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic,” a medical device company, “about state-of-the-art ventilators.” He also tweeted that Tesla “will make ventilators if there is a shortage” while noting that the machines “cannot be produced instantly.” 
He said Tesla’s Giga New York factory in Buffalo “will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible.”
Musk did not offer more specific information about his company’s plans, and Tesla did not respond to our request for comment.
He did tweet that he already has purchased and shipped more than 1,000 ventilators for use in Los Angeles, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom confirmed in a press conference on March 23.
So, automakers are currently working to help meet the demand for ventilators, whether that means helping other companies that already make the machines, or developing plans to produce ventilators themselves.
But none of those vehicle companies is manufacturing the devices “right now,” as the president said. 
Even General Motors has said that its factory has to be retooled before production can begin.",D'Angelo Gore,2020-03-27 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Depending on the needs of the federal government, Ventec and GM are poised to deliver the first ventilators next month and ramp up to a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with the infrastructure and capability to scale further.”
After that announcement, Trump lashed out at GM on Twitter, saying that “late April” isn’t soon enough and that GM must “START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW.”
Trump also then invoked the Defense Production Act to force GM to make them. Hackett: I’m saying that by — you have to scale this up, so I’m saying by early May, we could — you could see, across the world, hundreds of thousands of ventilators being built from multiple suppliers, not just Ford Motor Company. In a March 21 press briefing with members of the White House coronavirus task force, for example, Trump said that GM and Ford were making ventilators “right now.”
Trump, March 21: You know, a ventilator is a machine. When asked if GM was already producing ventilators, a spokesman, Dan Flores, provided us with another joint statement that said: “Ventec Life Systems and General Motors have been working around the clock to implement plans to build more critical care ventilators. For instance, he told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota that it may take until well into May for Ford and other producers worldwide to be making “hundreds of thousands of ventilators”:
Camerota, March 24: And just — I mean, is there any way to give me a timeline?"
234,Article Falsely Reports on Health of Pope Francis,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/article-falsely-reports-on-health-of-pope-francis/,,"835Quick Take
An article circulating on social media claims without evidence that Pope Francis and two of his aides have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The Vatican has said the pope has a cold, “with no symptoms related to other pathologies.”

Full Story
An article circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Pope Francis and two of his Vatican aides have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. The article, which originally appeared on the website MCM News, also includes photos of Francis looking visibly ill, blowing his nose and coughing during a Mass in Rome on Ash Wednesday.
The Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported on March 3 that the pope has been tested for the coronavirus and that his results were negative. Il Messaggero does not list a source for the information about test results, but multiple news outlets have since repeated the claim, citing the Il Messaggero article. 
The Vatican has not verified any of these claims, nor has it disclosed whether or not the pope was tested for the coronavirus.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni issued a statement on March 3 saying, “The cold the Holy Father was diagnosed with recently is running its course, with no symptoms related to other pathologies.”
“In the meantime, Pope Francis celebrates Mass daily and is following the spiritual exercises taking place at the Divine Master House in Ariccia,” Bruni said, referring to the Lenten retreat.
Speculation regarding the pope’s health began after he cancelled his participation in the weeklong retreat in the Roman countryside. During the traditional Sunday blessing on March 1 in St. Peter’s Square, the pope told the crowd that “unfortunately a cold prevents me from participating this year.”
It is the first time in his papacy that the 83-year-old pontiff has had to miss the event. Francis also canceled two planned official audiences earlier in the week due to what Bruni called “a slight indisposition.”
The rumors regarding the pope’s health come as Italy faces the largest outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe. In a media briefing earlier this week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Italy is one of four countries (including South Korea, Iran and Japan) that is of “greatest concern” to the WHO as the coronavirus continues to spread.
Italy has had more than 3,000 confirmed cases within its borders, resulting in more than 100 deaths. The Italian government recently mandated the temporary closure of all schools and universities in order to further prevent the spread of the illness.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that “[o]lder people and people with certain underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example, seem to be at greater risk of serious illness” as a result of contracting the coronavirus. Due to the pontiff’s age and diminished lung capacity — the pope reportedly had a lung removed as a teenager — Francis is among those most at risk.

235,Timeline of Contradictory Statements on Trump’s Health,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/timeline-of-contradictory-statements-on-trumps-health/,,"Since President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, White House staff and the president’s physicians have provided confusing and at times contradictory information about the president’s health.
Trump’s medical team has portrayed his illness as relatively mild and improving, but also has shared details that would suggest the president may be sicker than they have described.
Here, we share what was said when and highlight instances in which information was not relayed with full accuracy or transparency.
Thursday, Oct. 1
Evening
Between 9 and 10 p.m. — Trump tells Fox News’ Sean Hannity: “I’ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning. But, you know, I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady,” in confirming that White House counselor Hope Hicks had tested positive. But before the Hannity interview, Trump had tested positive for COVID-19 using a rapid-results test, the Wall Street Journal later reported. He was awaiting the results on a more accurate test.
Friday, Oct. 2
Morning
12:54 a.m. — In a tweet, the president announces he has tested positive for COVID-19. “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”
1:06 a.m. — Shortly after Trump’s announcement, the White House releases a memo dated Oct. 1 from the president’s doctor, Navy physician Sean P. Conley. “This evening I received confirmation that both President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Conley says. He also says, “The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.” But those plans changed later in the day.
Afternoon
About 1:45 p.m. — In remarks to reporters, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany says the president is “hard at work despite the mild symptoms.”
About 4 p.m — In a late afternoon memo, Conley provides a second update on the president’s condition and treatment. “As of this afternoon, the President remains fatigued but in good spirits.” But, he adds, “as a precautionary measure he received a single 8 gram dose of Regeneron’s polyclonal antibody cocktail.”
“In addition to the polyclonal antibodies, the President has been taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin,” Conley says. There was no mention of the president receiving supplemental oxygen, which the public did not learn about until Sunday.
About 5 p.m. — Trump is taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In a statement, the press secretary describes the president as being in “good spirits” with “mild symptoms.” McEnany says, “Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.”
Evening 
11:34 p.m. — The White House issues a third medical update from Conley. In the memo, Conley says that as of “this evening” Trump is “doing very well” but he had recommended that the president be moved to Walter Reed “for further monitoring.” Conley adds, “He is not requiring any supplemental oxygen, but in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate Remdesivir therapy. He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably.” In fact, Trump did receive supplemental oxygen that day.
Saturday, Oct. 3
Morning
At a late morning press briefing, Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, says that “the President this morning is not on oxygen, not having difficulty breathing or walking around the White House Medical Unit upstairs.” Asked if that meant the president did not receive any supplemental oxygen, Conley responds, “He’s not on oxygen right now.” Pressed again, Conley falsely says, “Yesterday and today, he was not on oxygen.”
As for other medical treatments, Dr. Brian Garibaldi says, “About 48 hours ago, the president received a special antibody therapy directed against the coronavirus, and we’re working very closely with the company to monitor him in terms of that outcome. Yesterday evening, he received his first dose of IV remdesivir. And our plan is to continue a five-day treatment course for remdesivir.” Garibaldi’s statement on when the antibody therapy treatment started seems to contradict Conley’s Friday evening memo.
Conley also causes confusion when he says that Trump was “72 hours into the diagnosis,” raising questions about when Trump was first diagnosed. A reporter asks Conley, “You said 72 hours. That would put it that Wednesday.” He responds, “So Thursday afternoon, following the news of a close contact is when we repeated testing. And given clinical indications, I had a little bit more concern. And that’s when, late that night, we got the PCR confirmation that he was.”
As for the president’s fever, Conley says, “It’s important to note the president’s been fever free for over 24 hours.” He gives a generally upbeat assessment, describing the president as “doing great” — although that would almost immediately be contradicted by a top White House staffer.
After describing Trump’s vitals in good shape and his blood pressure in particular as “great,” Conley is asked why the president had been transferred to the hospital, to which Conley replies, “Because he’s the president of the United States.”
Afternoon 
About 12 noon — In an email sent to reporters, the White House pool reporter traveling with the president passes along a statement that is attributed to “a source familiar with the president’s health” that says: “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.” It was later disclosed that the anonymous source was White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
About 1:50 p.m. — The White House releases a statement from Conley that seeks to address the confusion about when the president was diagnosed and when treatment began.
“This morning while summarizing the President’s health, I incorrectly used the term ‘seventy-two hours’ instead of ‘day three’ and ‘forty eight hours’ instead of ‘day two’ with regard to his diagnosis and the administration of the polyclonal antibody therapy,” he says. “The President was first diagnosed with COVID-19 on the evening of Thursday, October 1st and had received Regeneron’s antibody cocktail on Friday, October 2nd.”
Evening 
6:51 p.m. — Trump speaks to the public for the first time since being hospitalized in a four-minute video that he posts on Twitter. “I came here, wasn’t feeling so well. I feel much better now,” he says. “We’re working hard to get me all the way back.” 
9:08 p.m. — The White House releases a statement from Conley that says the president had made “substantial progress.”
“This evening he completed his second dose of Remdesivir without complication,” Conley says. “He remains fever-free and off supplemental oxygen with a saturation level between 96 and 98% all day.” Conley’s statement does not clarify if the president had been on oxygen.
Sunday, Oct. 4
Morning 
Shortly before noon — Conley and other doctors treating Trump give a press briefing. Conley says that “the president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation,” indicating Trump’s lungs may be compromised. As a result, the president began to take dexamethasone, a steroid drug.
Conley also discloses for the first time that the president had received supplemental oxygen on Friday, for about an hour. “Late Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94%. Given these two developments, I was concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness,” Conley says. “I recommended the president we try some supplemental oxygen, see how he’d respond.”
Asked why he failed to disclose earlier that the president had received supplemental oxygen, Conley says: “I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness has had. I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction and in doing so, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true.”
When asked if Trump had received oxygen a second time, Conley suggests that the answer is no, but he isn’t definitive. “I’d have to check with the nursing staff. If he did, it was very, very limited,” he says, emphasizing that Trump was not on oxygen then and the only oxygen that Conley ordered had been on Friday morning.
The addition of dexamethasone to the president’s regimen is particularly curious, as the drug is not recommended for patients who are not on supplemental oxygen.
The RECOVERY trial in the U.K., which established the drug had a mortality benefit in hospitalized patients who were ventilated or on supplemental oxygen, did not find a benefit — and identified possible harm — in providing the drug to those who were not on oxygen at the time of randomization. 
This had led some physicians to speculate that Trump’s condition might be worse than what has been shared with the public, or that Trump might be receiving very aggressive treatment, which may not necessarily benefit him.
Conley also refuses to provide specifics on other information that would get at Trump’s medical condition. 
When asked about what X-rays or CT scans show, and whether there are signs of pneumonia or lung damage, Conley responds vaguely, “We’re tracking all of that. There’s some expected findings, but nothing of any major clinical concern.”
“Expected findings,” some doctors say, likely means some signs of lung damage — or at least enough concern to initiate the dexamethasone. As Vanderbilt University infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner told ABC News, Trump’s oxygen levels and CT scan results are “undoubtedly what targeted physicians’ decision to add dexamethasone.”
Afternoon
5:16 p.m. — Trump posts a short video on Twitter. “We’re getting great reports from the doctors,” he says.
About 5:20 p.m. — Trump briefly leaves Walter Reed in a presidential motorcade to visit and wave to supporters outside before returning to the hospital. At least two Secret Service members, wearing what appeared to be N95 masks, were inside the enclosed vehicle with the president, who wore a mask. While the White House said the trip had been “cleared” by the medical team, some experts, including a physician at Walter Reed, considered the excursion unnecessarily risky for his security detail.
Monday, October 5
Afternoon
2:37 p.m. — Trump tweets: “I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. … I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”
About 3:10 p.m. — Conley, the president’s physician, and others on the president’s medical team give an update on Trump’s health and his scheduled return to the White House. “Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations — and most importantly his clinical status — support the president’s safe return home,” Conley says.
Dooley says the president’s temperature on the morning of Oct. 5 was 98.1 degrees. Conley says the president has not received fever reducing medication for the last 72 hours.
Conley declines to discuss some details, such as the date of the president’s last negative test. Conley also would not share any information on the president’s viral load or possible lung damage. He would only say that the supplemental oxygen wasn’t required and the president wasn’t short of breath when it was administered, which happened twice. “It was more of us trying to anticipate needs and see how he’d respond,” he says, adding it was given for a short period of time.

236,Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-posts-distort-testimony-of-federal-health-officials-on-employee-vaccinations/,,"SciCheck Digest
Federal health officials testified at a Senate committee hearing that about 60% of their employees have been vaccinated against COVID-19 so far. But viral online posts have distorted their comments to misleadingly claim that half of the employees “are refusing” the vaccines. The officials did not say anyone had refused to get vaccinated.

There are three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. that have all received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. More than 279 million vaccine doses had been administered in the U.S. and 60.5% of adults had received at least one shot as of May 21. (See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.”)
On May 11, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, testified at a Senate committee hearing on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Questioned by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina about the number of their employees who have received COVID-19 vaccines, Fauci estimated that “around 60%” of NIAID staff have been vaccinated and Marks said a similar percentage of FDA employees have been vaccinated.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also testified before the Senate committee but did not state how many CDC employees have been vaccinated.
But since then, viral social media posts and digital stories have distorted what Fauci, Marks and Walensky said.
The headline on an article that claims more than 18,000 views on WeLoveTrump.com reads, “Half of CDC, NIH, and FDA Employees Refused the Experimental COVID-19 Jabs.” (Along with twisting Fauci’s words, the headline misrepresents his government position. He is director of NIAID, which is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health.)
A similar Instagram post shows a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet posted by the account @Breaking911 reading, “NEW: About 40-50% of CDC, FDA employees are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine according to Fauci, Marks.”
The percentages in these claims distort the health officials’ responses to say that “40-50%” of their employees have “refused” the vaccine.
While reviewing ongoing COVID-19 prevention measures and guidance during the Senate committee hearing, Burr posed the question to Fauci, Marks and Walensky.
Burr, May 11: This question, I’m going to go to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Marks, and Dr. Walensky. What percentage of the employees in your institute, your center, or your agency, of your employees, has been vaccinated?
Fauci: I’m not 100% sure, Senator, but I think it’s probably a little bit more than half, probably around 60%.
Burr: Dr. Marks?
Marks: I can’t tell you the exact number, but it’s probably in the same range. Some people vaccinated at our facility, and others outside of the facility.
Burr: Dr. Walensky?
Walensky: We’re encouraging our employees to get vaccinated. We’ve been doing town halls and education seminars. Our staff have the option to report their vaccination status, but as you understand, the federal government is not requiring it, so we do not know.

None of the federal health officials said members of their staff refused to get COVID-19 vaccines.
An FDA spokeswoman told us in an email: “The post’s suggestion that a majority of staff have refused to get their vaccine is absolutely false. The FDA is offering COVID-19 vaccines to employees and we know employees are also choosing to receive vaccines through local, state or privately operated vaccination sites. Because the FDA does not mandate vaccinations or require staff to report their vaccinations, we do not know the exact percentage of our staff who have not yet been vaccinated, but we have been encouraged to hear from the large number of our staff who have chosen to be vaccinated.”
We reached out to the CDC and NIAID to clarify if any employees were refusing vaccines, but did not hear back. We will update this article if we get a response.
Update, May 28: After we published our article, the NIAID sent us a statement that said Fauci “did not say that 40 to 50% are refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.” The statement continued: “To our knowledge, the percentage of NIH staff who have received a vaccine at NIH or self-reported receiving a vaccine in the community is close to 67%. The actual number may be higher since self-reporting is voluntary and there may be staff who received the vaccine in the community but have not reported it to us.”

237,Explaining Coronavirus Misinformation,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/explaining-coronavirus-misinformation/,,"31FactCheck.org writers Jessica McDonald and Angelo Fichera were interviewed by a South Korean radio program about their work combating misinformation related to the new coronavirus.
Since China reported a mysterious cluster of pneumonia cases to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31, false and misleading information has sprung up online and on social media about the virus responsible for the disease. 
Some people have falsely suggested that the Chinese scientists were removed from a Canadian lab for shipping pathogens to Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Others have inaccurately claimed that Lysol and Clorox were aware of the virus before it emerged.
In a segment airing on “This Morning,” a live English-language radio program in South Korea, science writer Jessica McDonald explained that much of the misinformation results from confusion over the term “coronavirus,” which is not specific to the new virus, and can refer to a variety of viruses in the coronavirus family. The new virus temporarily goes by the name 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. 
In the same interview, staff writer Angelo Fichera discussed the partnership FactCheck.org has with Facebook, and told how an emergency preparedness event conducted last autumn was distorted online to falsely suggest that the new coronavirus had been predicted. He wrote about that in his Jan. 29 article, “New Coronavirus Wasn’t ‘Predicted’ In Simulation.”

238,Flawed Variant Information Fuels Baseless COVID-19 Theory,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-flawed-variant-information-fuels-baseless-covid-19-theory/,,"SciCheck Digest
A conspiracy theory online baselessly suggests that the World Health Organization and other groups preplanned the variants of the novel coronavirus — citing a dubious timeline. But the timeline doesn’t square with the reality of when variants have been identified and designated thus far.

The World Health Organization in late May moved to a new system for naming certain variants of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Specifically, the WHO said it would use letters of the Greek alphabet for labeling variants of interest and variants of concern. As we’ve explained, viruses mutate as they replicate. A mutation is one change to the genetic sequence of a virus, and a variant is a distinct virus, typically with several mutations.

A conspiracy theory shared on social media, however, is baselessly suggesting that public health officials and others somehow preplanned the variants. But the posts spreading the theory ignore the facts of how — and, more importantly, when — SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified to date.
“These are the PLANNED COVID-19 VARIANTS – just look at the dates when they will be ‘released’ to the media,” reads one image shared in a July 26 Instagram post, which was liked more than 1,000 times. “DON’T BE STUPID, YOU ARE BEING PLAYED AND MANIPULATED.”
The image includes a table with a list of the letters of the Greek alphabet (though the table begins with delta) under the Spanish label “Cepa/variante,” meaning “strain/variant.” Next to each letter is a month and year for “Lanzamiento,” Spanish for “launch,” through February 2023.
Beside the table are the logos of various groups — including the World Health Organization, World Economic Forum, Johns Hopkins University and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — seeming to suggest the groups are behind the purported plan to announce a new variant every month.
It’s unclear where the table actually originated though, and there’s no proof it came from the entities cited. Representatives for the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation all told us the table did not come from their organizations.
What we do know is that the dubious timeline has been circulating on social media since at least early July, and has been spread with posts in various languages — such as English, Spanish and Italian.
But the table doesn’t square with the actual timing of when SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified and labeled to date.
For example, the table indicates that the delta variant will be launched in June 2021. But that variant was first documented in India in October 2020, according to the WHO, and was deemed a variant of interest in April 2021. It became a variant of concern in May and has now become the dominant variant in the U.S.
A number of other variants also have been identified months ahead of what the timeline purports will happen.
The eta, iota, kappa and lambda variants were all first documented in late 2020, and were deemed variants of interest between March and June 2021. But the social media table suggests those variants wouldn’t be announced until later this year or early 2022.
Baseless claims that the pandemic was somehow preplanned have been circulating since the very start of the spread of the novel coronavirus. The social media posts now citing a purported variant timeline don’t make that theory any more credible.

239,Partisan Claims About Flight Cancellations Lack Evidence,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-partisan-claims-about-flight-cancellations-lack-evidence/,,"Southwest Airlines’ flight cancellations fueled partisan claims over the weekend that transportation workers were protesting COVID-19 vaccine requirements and causing the cancellations. But there’s no evidence that workers staged protests. The Federal Aviation Administration, the airline and labor unions have all cited other reasons.

Southwest Airlines cancelled more than 2,500 flights between Friday, Oct. 8 and Tuesday, Oct. 12, the company told us in an email. Several factors led to the cancellations, which we’ll explain below.
Over the weekend, though, social media churned the company’s disarray into criticism of President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates, claiming the cancellations were due to transportation-industry workers’ protests against the mandates. There is no evidence that workers staged protests.
But, on Oct. 9, a Twitter account that posts former President Donald Trump’s statements and other political content shared a TikTok video recorded in the Orlando International Airport. It added this claim: “BREAKING: Air Traffic Controllers In Jacksonville, FL Staged A Walkout Yesterday In Response To The Vaccine Mandate It’s Being Reported That All Flights In & Out Of FL Were Cancelled As A Result Mainstream Media Chose Not To Report On This As Of Yet.”
A day later, that tweet was featured in a story on the conservative website Gateway Pundit.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar claim on Twitter the same day, adding that there was a shortage of pilots, too. “Joe Biden’s illegal vaccine mandate at work! Suddenly, we’re short on pilots & air traffic controllers. #ThanksJoe,” Cruz wrote, with a link to a CNBC story about Southwest’s problems.
On Monday, conservative commentators Benny Johnson and Candace Owens posted a video of an airline pilot advocating against vaccine requirements. The video was viewed more than 2 million times on Twitter.
With it, Owens wrote: “FINALLY!! People are saying ENOUGH IS ENOUGH with these tyrannical mandates. I am so proud of this brave, Southwest Airlines pilot— and ALL the pilots, flight attendants, nurses, and individuals that are choosing freedom over tyranny.”
But Shawn Walker, the pilot in the video, doesn’t work for Southwest, the company confirmed to us in an email. Walker identified himself as an American Airlines pilot on his LinkedIn page, but American Airlines didn’t answer our question about whether he works there. The video was originally posted to Walker’s TikTok account that promotes his CBD supplement website.
It’s also worth noting that nowhere in the video did Walker say that he was participating in a work-related protest. Rather, he plugged an organization called US Freedom Flyers, which describes itself as “a group of transportation industry employees who have come together to fight federal and state mandates which aim to strip Citizens of their right to medical freedom.”
Fox News host Tucker Carlson also highlighted the US Freedom Flyers, interviewing Joshua Yoder, who identified himself as the group’s co-founder. Although Yoder advocated against the mandates, he also told Carlson, “I will never promote a sick-out or work action, that is illegal.”
Airline employees are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which despite its name has covered airline workers since 1936, according to a Congressional Research Service report. The labor law regulates collective bargaining rights, including when workers can strike, to prevent labor disputes that could interrupt railway and airline service and harm the economy, the CRS report said.
Carlson didn’t interview anyone who had participated in the purported protests, but he did claim that, to protest the mandates, “this weekend … a large number of Southwest pilots called out sick — they effectively shut down their airline … at the same moment they decided to do this, a large group of air traffic controllers apparently reached the very same conclusion.”
But we could find no evidence for those claims.
So, What Caused the Cancellations?
Southwest Airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the unions representing Southwest’s pilots and air traffic controllers have all cited reasons other than vaccine-mandate protests for the cancellations.
That’s not to say that some airline employees or air traffic controllers aren’t opposed to getting vaccinated against COVID-19. United Airlines, for example, is reportedly firing 232 of its roughly 67,000 U.S. employees because they have not complied with its vaccine requirement.
It’s also possible that some workers may have called in sick to demonstrate their objection to the vaccine requirements. Southwest had announced on Oct. 4 that all employees

would have to comply with Biden’s executive order requiring federal contractors to be vaccinated against COVID-19. On Oct. 8, a day before the extensive flight cancellations, the union that represents Southwest’s pilots sought to block the requirement, telling a federal court that the terms hadn’t been properly negotiated.
But, if anyone did call in sick, those workers don’t appear to have caused Southwest’s problems.
Here’s how the problems unfolded, according to what is publicly available:
On Saturday, Oct. 9, Southwest announced on Twitter that air traffic control issues and “disruptive weather” had caused cancellations.
On Oct. 10, the FAA said that “Flight delays & cancellations occurred for a few hours Friday PM due to widespread severe weather, military training, & limited staffing in one area of the Jacksonville en route center.”
The Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center is one of 20 air traffic control hubs across the country that keep planes moving between airports.
A local news station reported on a letter citing an FAA official, saying the center had “some staffing issues” late on Friday, Oct. 8, which were due to “[n]ormal approved leave” and “[c]ontrollers who received either their first or second dose of the vaccine and by policy are required to stay at home for (48) hours to self-monitor for side effects……thus creating some staffing issues.”
We reached out to the control center to confirm that this was the case, and we were referred to the FAA, which did not respond to our requests for comment.
“We are aware that there was weather that affected operations at Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center on Friday, a common occurrence in that facility’s airspace,” Doug Church, spokesman for the air traffic controllers’ union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told us in an email.
“We are unaware of anything else that may have caused delays,” he said.
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association weighed in on Oct. 10, saying in a statement: “There are false claims of job actions by Southwest Pilots currently gaining traction on social media and making their way into mainstream news. I can say with certainty that there are no work slowdowns or sickouts either related to the recent mandatory vaccine mandate or otherwise.”
Casey Murray, the union president, told the Dallas Morning News the following day, “We have the data from this weekend and our sick rates were exactly in line with where they were all summer with the same kind of operational disasters.”
Southwest’s chief operating officer, Mike Van de Ven, also said that the rate of sick calls was normal. “There’s no indication in any of our data that there is anything going on nefariously with respect to any type of activity like that,” Van de Ven told USA Today.
He also explained that Florida is “a critical node in our network,” with about half of Southwest’s planes flying through the state every day.
“So when we have a disruption, a significant disruption, in Florida, it tends to spread to our entire network,” Van de Ven reportedly said. “And that was the situation that happened to us on Friday.”
Southwest operates on a point-to-point model, which means that its planes fly between airports on a diffuse network, while other major carriers use a hub-and-spoke model, which means that planes return to a central airport after each flight.
“When you do that, you don’t sort of shuttle back and forth to a hub, it makes the recovery much more complicated because pilots are stuck all over the country. And you can’t just substitute one flight for another coming in and out of the hub,” Joe Schwieterman, a transportation expert and professor at DePaul University, told NPR in an Oct. 13 interview.
Also, the same problems that Southwest pointed to — weather and air traffic control issues — affect the industry as a whole, Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst, said in the same NPR report.
But, Harteveldt said, “while other airlines were able to snap back to their normal level of operation fairly quickly, Southwest has been struggling. And on Sunday, they just had a total meltdown.”
On Monday, as claims about the cancellations were flourishing, the FAA again took to Twitter to clarify: “To be clear: None of the information from Southwest, its pilots union, or the FAA indicates that this weekend’s cancellations were related to vaccine mandates.”
So, there’s no evidence that worker protests led to Southwest’s cancellations over the weekend, but there is evidence that a combination of other factors combined to cause logistical problems for the company.",Saranac Hale Spencer,2021-10-14 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"And on Sunday, they just had a total meltdown.”

240,Headlines Distort the Facts on CDC Mask Order,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-headlines-distort-the-facts-on-cdc-mask-order/,,"SciCheck Digest
Headlines shared on social media distort the facts of a recent order by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that mandates face masks be worn on public transportation. The order doesn’t require that individuals wear two masks. CDC guidance issued with the order does say that cloth masks should be made of at least two layers.

Some independent experts are now advising that wearing two masks — such as a cloth mask paired with a surgical mask — in some situations could provide greater benefit when it comes to controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus. The advice to improve masks comes as the U.S. documents cases of more transmissible variants of the virus.
Whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will officially endorse the advice of double-masking isn’t yet known. Officials have said they are currently exploring relevant data, and a CDC spokesperson told us the agency hopes to offer additional insight next week.
(Update, Feb. 10: The CDC has now posted the results of a lab experiment that found that a cloth mask worn over a medical procedure mask can significantly improve the fit and effectiveness of the masks. The CDC’s website now suggests that form of double-masking as one modification for better protection.)
But the federal agency has not issued a “demand” that the public wear two masks, as a headline shared on social media claims.

A recent video by the “Ron Paul Liberty Report” on YouTube, viewed more than 18,000 times, was titled: “CDC Now Demands TWO Masks – Science…Or Tyranny?”
That’s wrong. And those who watch the video are presented with a muddied take on a recent order by the CDC that stipulates that those using public transportation must wear a mask. The order went into effect Feb. 1.
More than seven minutes into the video, a co-host of the show, Daniel McAdams, shows a headline from ZeroHedge, an unreliable website with a history of peddling misinformation, that reads: “Medical Tyranny: CDC Announces All Travelers Must Wear Two Masks, Threatens Arrest.”
(In an example of how misinformation spreads, ZeroHedge actually credits the faulty report to another website, “Planet Free Will.” And that website had republished the story after it appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.)
The “Liberty Report” video then points to a CNN report about the CDC’s order. That article said, in part, “[t]he coverings need to be at least two or more layers of breathable fabric secured to the head with ties, ear loops or elastic bands — and scarves and bandanas do not count, the order says.”
The actual text of the order simply defines “masks” as “a material covering the nose and mouth of the wearer, excluding face shields.” A footnote adds that, “Masks can be either manufactured or homemade and should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.”
The CNN report was referencing the CDC’s guidance issued with the order. That guidance says that cloth masks, among other attributes, “should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source).” (Emphasis is ours.)
But a mask “made with two or more layers” is not the same as two masks, as the video and headlines claim.
Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told us the recommendation that cloth masks be made with at least two layers has been around “for some time as one layer is not very efficient at filtering virus.”
In fact, the CDC’s own website instructed as much months before President Joe Biden took office — so it isn’t some new guidance related to the transportation order. A CDC page about face masks archived on Aug. 27, 2020, advised: “Wear masks with two or more layers to stop the spread of COVID-19.”
Many face masks available for purchase are made with more than one layer.
The CDC spokesperson, Jason McDonald, reiterated to us in an email that the CDC website “recommends wearing masks with 2 or more layers of washable, breathable fabric. If you’re wearing a cloth mask, the layers of fabric should be tightly woven and you should not be able to see light through it.”
He added: “If the mask you have is a single layer of fabric, you could wear another one on top to achieve the recommended level of protection.”
In other words, you could double-up a cloth mask that only has one layer to create a covering that meets the two-layer recommendation.
Gandhi said in an email that her recommendation — through her work with Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech — “is to use a cloth mask with a filter inside when indoors in areas where high rates of transmission are occurring. So, two pieces of cloth with a filter inside since the filter blocks the virus electrostatically and the cloth blocks it physically.”
It’s worth noting that while the text of the CDC order on wearing masks on public transportation says it “reserves the right” to enforce the order through criminal penalties, it said it “does not intend” to rely on such penalties — and instead anticipates voluntary compliance.
The “Liberty Report” video goes on to present a video clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci saying, “There are many people who feel, you know, if you really want to have an extra little bit of protection, maybe I should put two masks on. There’s nothing wrong with that. But there’s no data that indicates that that is going to make a difference.”
That was during a Jan. 28 live-stream video with the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, went on to say that while the CDC had not changed its mask guidance, the agency would continue to review data on the issue. “But the bottom line is, the minimum thing you need to do is always wear a mask under circumstances when you’re in settings, where you’re with people, or you’re in congregate settings,” he said.
During a Feb. 3 briefing (at 23:15), he made a similar point, saying that the CDC would continue to update recommendations based on data. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky agreed, saying her agency was “actively looking” at the matter and “more data will be forthcoming from the CDC with regard to the value of double-masking.”

241,Hank Aaron’s Death Attributed to Natural Causes,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/01/scicheck-hank-aarons-death-attributed-to-natural-causes/,,"
Henry “Hank” Aaron, 86, “passed away peacefully in his sleep” on Jan. 22, according to a statement from the Atlanta Braves, the team for which he played 21 of his 23 seasons in Major League Baseball. He died more than two weeks after he publicly received his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at a Morehouse Healthcare clinic on Jan. 5.
That sequence of events has led some social media users to suggest there was a direct link between his getting the shot and then dying several days later. 
But there is no evidence that is the case. 
One person wrote on Facebook: “Our Brother Hank Aaron – RIP – wanted to be an example and an inspiration to Black People by taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, he may have become a clear example to Black People of why this vaccine CANNOT be trusted. … Two weeks after receiving his first Moderna shot, Hank Aaron died in his sleep. No cause of death is given, but you do the math.”
Another Facebook user, who juxtaposed one news article about Aaron getting the vaccine and another about his subsequent death, wrote: “I hope people receive the message that this mans death should send to the rest of us!”
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has promoted COVID-19 misinformation, tweeted that “#HankAaron’s tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of #COVID #vaccines.” Kennedy’s tweet linked to a post by his organization, the Children’s Health Defense, baselessly suggesting Aaron may have died as a result of the vaccine.
While the exact cause of Aaron’s death has not been determined, health officials do not believe it was related to him being vaccinated.
An official with the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office, which examined Aaron’s body following his death, told FactCheck.org by phone that he died “due to natural causes.”
In a statement emailed to AFP Fact Check, the county medical examiner, Karen Sullivan, said: “There was no information suggestive of an allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any substance which might be attributable to recent vaccine distribution.”
She added: “In addition, examination of Mr. Aaron’s body did not suggest his death was due to any event other than that associated with his medical history.”
WSB-TV in Atlanta reported that Aaron had a history of prostate issues and hypertension. In addition, he received treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee and used a wheelchair later in life.
The Morehouse School of Medicine, which is affiliated with the Atlanta clinic where Aaron was immunized, also said the vaccine was not a factor in his death.
The historically Black medical school emailed us a statement that said: “Mr. Aaron was a public health advocate and worked with us to help bridge the health equity gap in Atlanta and around the world. His passing was not related to the vaccine, nor did he experience any side effects from the immunization. He passed away peacefully in his sleep.”
Aaron was among more than 20 civil and human rights activists — all over age 75 — who were vaccinated at the new health facility to “promote vaccine acceptance in the Black community,” the medical school said in a Jan. 5 press release.
A December survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research had found that just 23% of Black Americans at the time said they definitely planned to get the coronavirus vaccine when it became available. That was much lower than the 53% of whites and 34% of Hispanics who said the same.
On the day of his vaccination, Aaron told the Associated Press: “I don’t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. … It’s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.”
Andrew Young, the former congressman, mayor and U.S. ambassador, who also was vaccinated at the clinic the same day as Aaron, told Atlanta’s 11Alive that he was told Aaron “never had any reaction” to the shot prior to his death.
“I talked to the fella who was his driver, and I said, ‘was Hank feeling any discomfort or any problem over the last few days?’ and he said, ‘no, he wanted to keep his schedule,'” the news station quoted Young as saying. 
As we have written, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines both received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration after being thoroughly tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials with thousands of participants. (For more, please see our SciCheck story, “Q&A on COVID-19 Vaccines.”)
On Jan. 22, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that after more than 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine were administered between Dec. 21, 2020, and Jan. 10, 2021, only 10 cases of anaphylaxis, or “a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction,” were found.  
“Nine of the 10 anaphylaxis case reports included a patient history of allergies or allergic reactions, including to drugs (six), contrast media (two), and foods (one); five patients had experienced an episode of anaphylaxis in the past, none of which was associated with receipt of a vaccine,” the CDC said.

242,Conspiracy Theory Misinterprets Goals of Gates Foundation,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/conspiracy-theory-misinterprets-goals-of-gates-foundation/,,"Quick Take
A conspiracy theory falsely claims Bill Gates is plotting to use COVID-19 testing and a future vaccine to track people with microchips. The Gates Foundation has advocated for expanded testing and has funded vaccine research, but neither of those involves implanted microchips.

Full Story
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed millions of dollars to research treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 as the pandemic continues to spread across the globe.
Those endeavors are now fueling a conspiracy theory that falsely claims Bill Gates has plans to use the eventual vaccine to “track people.”
That claim has circulated in conspiracy theory groups online over the last few weeks, but it recently graduated to a more mainstream audience.
On April 6, Emerald Robinson, White House correspondent for the conservative website Newsmax, tweeted about Gates with a reference to another debunked conspiracy theory and concluded, “He basically controls global health policy. What’s the plan? Using vaccines to track people.”
Two days later, Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked U.S. Attorney General William Barr about Gates favoring “what some would say, tracking mechanisms.”
The claim appears to have developed after Gates participated in a March 18 forum on Reddit. There, he answered a question about maintaining businesses during the pandemic.
Bill Gates, March 18: Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.
The following day, a website called Biohackinfo.com posted a story with the headline: “Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.” It’s been shared more than 13,000 times on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle, and a YouTube video based on the story has been viewed more than 1.8 million times.
The story cited Gates’ answer in the forum and then declared, “The ‘digital certificates’ Gates was referring to are human-implantable ‘QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS.'”
But that’s not true. It’s a mash-up of two unrelated things.
First, digital certificates are used to send encrypted information over the internet, as in the common case of electronic signatures which are used to verify identity. They were officially defined by what is now called the Telecommunication Standardization Sector in 1988 and have always been virtual, not physical.
When Gates mentioned their use in the forum, he was referring to digital certificates as part of an effort to create a digital platform that would expand home-based, self-administered testing for COVID-19, the Gates Foundation said in an email to FactCheck.org.
He referred to the same effort to ramp up home testing at another point in the forum, saying, “The testing in the US is not organized yet. In the next few weeks I hope the Government fixes this by having a website you can go to to find out about home testing and kiosks… Whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing. South Korea did a great job on this including digital contact tracing.”
South Korea, which has implemented an extensive testing system, created a website that showed information about where patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had been in order to alert others in the area. Although the information on the site is anonymous, there has been some criticism that it’s an invasion of privacy.
Still, that’s a long way from “microchip implants.”
The second part of the claim — and the one that likely led to the microchip assertion — is a reference to unrelated research that was funded by the Gates Foundation and published in December. In an effort to address the problem of poor record-keeping in “low-resource settings,” such as developing countries, that research proposed keeping a record of vaccination on a patient’s skin. It tested an invisible dye that could last up to five years and be read with a specially adapted smartphone.
Kevin McHugh, a bioengineering professor at Rice University who worked on the study, told us by email that the ink couldn’t be used as a tracking device.
“These markings were developed to provide a vaccination record and there is no ability to track anyone’s movements,” McHugh said. “This technology is only able to provide very limited (e.g. non-personalized) data locally. These markings require direct line-of-sight imaging from a distance of less than 1 foot. Remote or continuous tracking is simply not possible for a variety of technical reasons.”
The Gates Foundation confirmed to us by email that this research is unrelated to any measures related to COVID-19 vaccines.
So, this claim can be added to the heap of bogus conspiracy theories about microchip tracking and Bill Gates.

243,Video Misconstrues Pelosi Tweet on ‘un-American Travel Ban’,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/video-misconstrues-pelosi-tweet-on-un-american-travel-ban/,,"Quick Take
A viral video makes the bogus claim that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Jan. 31 tweet criticized the Trump administration’s restriction on travelers from China to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Her tweet was unrelated to those travel restrictions.

Full Story
President Donald Trump instituted travel restrictions on five Muslim majority countries during his first year in office. This year, on Jan. 31, he added more countries to the list.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has opposed that policy from the start, took to Twitter to criticize the expansion, calling it an “un-American travel ban.”
Now, two months later, a video that’s been viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook and YouTube falsely claims that her tweet was about Trump’s decision on the same day to restrict travelers coming from China in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
These are two distinct and unrelated actions that were each taken on Jan. 31. Pelosi’s tweet wasn’t about the restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus.
In the first instance, Trump expanded his controversial ban on certain foreign nationals from mostly predominately Muslim countries. He added six new countries to the existing list of those affected — Burma (Myanmar), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. Half of them are majority Muslim, according to the Pew Research Center.
Pelosi responded to that expansion in a tweet that said: “The Trump Admin’s expansion of its un-American travel ban is a threat to our security, our values and the rule of law. Barring more than 350 million people from predominantly African countries from traveling to the US, this rule is discrimination disguised as policy.”
The video claims that tweet is evidence that Pelosi had initially characterized Trump’s move to restrict travel from China as “overreacting” to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
It’s not. As we said, her tweet was addressing an unrelated policy that was signed on the same day.
In the second action, which was aimed at addressing the spread of the novel-coronavirus, Trump limited travel for non-U.S. citizens, except for the immediate family of citizens and permanent residents, who were in China within two weeks of coming to the U.S.
Pelosi has not addressed that policy on Twitter, or anywhere else that we could find. We searched the Congressional Record, reviewed her weekly press briefings and other public appearances, and scoured news coverage on LexisNexis. We could find no comment from Pelosi regarding her position on that decision.
“The Dan Bongino Show,” which posted the video, did not respond to a request for comment.

244,Trump Gets Ahead of Himself on COVID-19 Therapies,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trump-gets-ahead-of-himself-on-covid-19-therapies/,,"President Donald Trump touted two drugs — including one currently on the market for other uses — that he said show “really good promise” as therapies to COVID-19. But he left the misleading impression that the drugs were “approved” to treat the coronavirus and available for “immediate delivery.”
In fact, neither of the drugs the president highlighted at a press conference on March 19 have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as therapy for COVID-19, though the FDA is moving forward rapidly with clinical trials.
The FDA is “looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications,” and that doctors can currently prescribe off-label. The FDA plans to study the results of those drugs in hopes that they can be offered as “bridge” therapies as they await completion of clinical trials for a vaccine, which may take a year, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said.
“We need to make sure that these — this sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time,” Hahn said, speaking just after Trump. “As an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage form right now, and that may do more harm than good.”
In a press release, Hahn said that while some of the therapies being investigated show “promise,” the FDA “also must ensure these products are effective; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other, more appropriate, treatments.”
Chloroquine
Trump first mentioned chloroquine, an old drug used to prevent and treat malaria, as well as to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
Trump said it has shown “very, very encouraging early results” for use in people who have contracted the novel coronavirus. An article published in February in Nature found that the drug limited infection of the virus in cells grown in the lab, and the authors recommended it be assessed in human patients. It is currently being tested in clinical trials in China, where it is included in government guidelines for treating coronavirus patients.
Trump noted that because it has been around for a long time, its side effects are well known “so we know that … if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.” The president described the drug as “a tremendous breakthrough” and a potential “game-changer.”
But he got a bit ahead of himself on the process.
“And we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” Trump said. “And that’s where the FDA has been so great. They’ve gone through the approval process; it’s been approved. And they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.”
“There’s tremendous promise. And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it’s — it was approved very, very quickly and it’s now approved, by prescription,” Trump said.
To be clear, chloroquine is not approved by the FDA for use on people with the coronavirus.
Hahn said chloroquine is approved “for the treatment of malaria as well as an arthritis condition.” The FDA is considering an “expanded use” trial of patients in the U.S. “to actually see if that benefits patients. And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and — asked and answered.”
According to an FDA press release issued after the press conference, “The FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.”
Hahn declined to speculate how long it might take before chloroquine — provided everything goes well in the clinical trials and the drug is deemed “safe and effective” — might be approved for use for COVID-19.
“We want to make sure that this is done well and right for the American people,” Hahn said. “The president is right. With an off-the-shelf drug, we do have a lot of information about the side effects of the drug.  So that really helps, in terms of expediting.  But — but I want to assure you that we’re working as quickly as we can.  I don’t want to speculate about a timeline at this point.”
In the meantime, if the drug show promise, the FDA says it will “engage with domestic manufacturers to ramp up production of this product to mitigate any potential supply chain pressures.”
Remdesivir
As for remdesivir, Trump misleadingly said “that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA.”
That drug has only been approved for a clinical trial, not for consumer use.
On Feb. 25, the National Institutes of Health announced that it had begun a clinical trial “to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” at the University of Nebraska.
The trial participants will be randomly assigned without their knowledge either remdesivir or a placebo.
“It was previously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses,” NIH said. 
As the president said, remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences Inc. Daniel O’Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said at a March 2 White House meeting that the company hopes to know by April if the drug works.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that — if all goes right — the drug could be ready for mass production by June.
“[I]f the trial that Daniel is talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it’s … effective or not,” Fauci said. “If you know by June that it’s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it, and you’re good to go.”",Robert Farley,2020-03-19 0:00:00,mostly fake,,mix,False,"“As an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage form right now, and that may do more harm than good.”

245,Coronavirus Fears Haven’t Sunk Sales of Corona Beer in U.S.,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/coronavirus-fears-havent-sunk-sales-of-corona-beer-in-u-s/,,"Quick Take
Corona’s parent company reports that its beer sales in the U.S. are up this year, contrary to viral Facebook posts that falsely claim its U.S. sales have dropped because of the new coronavirus.

Full Story
Corona beer’s public relations team doesn’t want its brand associated with an epidemic, but viral Facebook posts are falsely stating that beer drinkers are shunning Corona as a result of the new coronavirus.
The posts take a shot at the intelligence of the public, claiming that “the fact that Corona Beer is experiencing a profit loss shows you that there is a problem with the IQ level of the general population.”
But Constellation Brands, Corona’s producer, says its U.S. sales are up in the early part of the year and the company doesn’t have much exposure to international markets, such as China, which have suffered a greater impact from the disease.
Corona Extra sales grew 5% in the U.S. in the latest four-week period, which ended Feb. 16 — “nearly doubling the 52-week trend for the brand,” the company said. The company’s sales are primarily focused on the U.S. market, according to a statement from Constellation Brands. Only 2.7% of the company’s $8.1 billion in sales of all its products were outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2019.
Misinformation about the beer was fueled by a survey that claimed some beer drinkers stopped buying Corona beer because of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The survey about the Mexican-based lager was released Feb. 27 by 5W Public Relations and picked up by several news outlets. 
The New York-based public relations firm said it conducted phone interviews with 737 beer drinkers in the U.S. and found that 38% “would not buy Corona under any circumstances.” But the company did not publicize the survey questions or state why more than a third of those surveyed would not buy the beer. The percentage of regular Corona drinkers who said they wouldn’t buy the beer was much smaller.
“Among those who said they usually drink Corona, only 4% said they would stop drinking Corona,” the firm said, “but 14% said they wouldn’t order Corona in a public venue.”
It also claimed that 16% of those surveyed were confused about whether the beer was related to coronavirus, which has spread to more than 700 people in the U.S. and killed more than 20.
The two names do share the common Latin root corona, which refers to a halo or crown. The beer reportedly derives its name and logo from the crown that adorns the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the town of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The name of the disease refers to the crown-like spikes seen through a microscope on the surface of the virus.
“It’s extremely unfortunate that recent misinformation about the impact of this virus on our business has been circulating in traditional and social media without further investigation or validation,” Bill Newlands, president and chief executive officer at Constellation Brands, said in the company statement. “These claims simply do not reflect our business performance and consumer sentiment, which includes feedback from our distributor and retailer partners across the country. We’ve seen no impact to our people, facilities or operations and our business continues to perform very well.”

246,Video Makes Bogus Claims About ‘War Crimes’ and COVID-19 Vaccine Safety,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-video-makes-bogus-claims-about-war-crimes-and-covid-19-vaccine-safety/,,"SciCheck Digest
A video falsely claims that people receiving authorized COVID-19 vaccines are taking part in a deadly clinical trial and that those administering the doses are war criminals under the Nuremberg Code. That’s bogus. People getting the vaccines, which have been shown to be safe and effective, consent to receive them and aren’t participating in research.

A popular video from a British conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist makes a slew of false claims about government-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, including the incorrect notion that they are “experimental” and that the clinicians administering them are violating the Nuremberg Code.
That’s wrong on both counts. While phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccines are continuing as planned to collect additional data, that doesn’t mean the immunizations are experimental or that people who are now getting vaccinated are participating in a trial.
Moreover, nothing about the Nuremberg Code applies to the situation, as people getting the vaccines are doing so as part of their own medical care, not research. They also consent to receive the jabs and information about the vaccines is widely available.
The video also baselessly claims that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and tantamount to a “global genocide,” citing deaths that have not been proven to be from vaccines.
The claims are made in a 15-minute video by Dr. Vernon Coleman, a former general practitioner in the U.K. who is no longer registered to practice medicine. Coleman has a history of peddling discredited medical information and has argued that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax and that AIDS does not exist.
The video has been shared on multiple Facebook pages and appears on various websites, including a site run by Charlie Ward, a man who has previously made false claims about COVID-19 vaccines.
The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for use during the pandemic: Oxford University and AstraZeneca’s viral vectored vaccine, Pfizer/BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine and Moderna’s mRNA vaccine. The U.S.’s Food and Drug Administration has authorized the latter two for emergency use. (See SciCheck’s guides to those here and here.)
False Claims About Human Experimentation & War Crimes
In the video, Coleman claims the COVID-19 vaccine is “experimental” and says because the vaccine trials are still ongoing, “Everyone having the vaccine is therefore taking part in an experiment.”
He then goes on to claim that people giving the vaccines are legally war criminals under the Nuremberg Code. 
“The Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation written in 1947 … stated that explicit, voluntary consent from patients is required for human experimentation,” he says. “That means that patients must be told that they’re taking part in a trial and they must be warned of all the possible adverse events. That’s what informed consent means. … And so legally, all those people giving vaccinations are war criminals.”
“Everyone giving the COVID-19 vaccines without explaining that … it’s an experiment and without listing all the possible adverse events is a war criminal,” he continues. “That’s not rhetoric. It’s not opinion. It’s fact.”
Except that it’s not fact. People receiving the authorized vaccines are not participating in clinical trials. And because it’s not research, the Nuremberg Code has no bearing on anything — even though ethically, everything is still above board. No one is in danger of being a war criminal.
Holly Fernandez Lynch, an assistant professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine told us the claims were “ridiculous.” 
The Nuremberg Code, as we’ve explained before, is a code of research ethics created in the wake of the Nazis’ horrific treatment of human subjects in experiments during the Holocaust. One of its primary principles is that individuals participating in research should do so voluntarily and with adequate information about the experiment to make an informed decision.
Fernandez Lynch confirmed that Nuremberg only pertains to research and would have nothing to do with any COVID-19 vaccines given outside of a trial. But even if it did, the claim is bogus.
“People are consenting to get the vaccine,” she said. So even if Nuremberg was applicable here, “it’s not non-consensual. And no information is being hidden. It’s all very front and center.”
In the U.S., the FDA, for example, provides fact sheets for vaccine recipients that clearly state the findings of the clinical trials — including the potential risks and benefits — and a description of an emergency use authorization. An EUA is a bit different than full FDA approval, although the agency required a high level of evidence from a large, phase 3 randomized controlled trial.
Fernandez Lynch acknowledged, as the FDA does, that not everything is known about the vaccine, but noted that no one was being forced to be vaccinated and that there was full transparency.
“We ideally would be able to watch for longer to gather more safety information about these products, but we have to make tradeoffs when we’re in the middle of a pandemic,” she said. “And each individual person is going to have to decide whether those tradeoffs are acceptable to them.”
As our colleagues at Reuters have written, people in the U.K. give informed consent to be vaccinated, as outlined in the country’s Green Book. The consent forms for the COVID-19 vaccines are available on the government’s website.
In making his argument, Coleman focuses on the fact that the COVID-19 trials are still ongoing, referring viewers to the U.S. government’s clinical trial registration page for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which says the completion date for the trial is nearly two years away, on Jan. 31, 2023.
That’s true, but misleading. The trial won’t technically end until it follows participants for two years, but that neglects the reality that the main trial results are already available and have demonstrated the vaccine’s basic safety and efficacy in tens of thousands of individuals.
Based on that phase 3 trial information, which is publicly available and has been reviewed by multiple panels of experts, the U.S. and U.K. governments concluded the benefits outweigh the potential risks and decided to authorize the vaccine for emergency use. People getting the vaccines now are not trial participants.
Coleman also suggests that the U.K. government’s efforts to monitor people who are vaccinated is somehow suspicious.
“They advertise for special software so that they could keep track of the high number of adverse events they were expecting — for two years,” he says.
That, too, is misleading. The government is not necessarily expecting adverse events, but does want to be able to detect them if they occur. This is standard practice after the release of a new vaccine and the U.S. has similar efforts underway.
As we’ve explained before, these vaccine safety monitoring systems are important because while large phase 3 trials can show that there are no common safety concerns, rare events might only be observed once the vaccine is given to millions of people.
Bogus Claims of Vaccine-Related Deaths
A prevailing theme throughout Coleman’s video is the baseless idea that the available COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to large numbers of people.
“Thousands of people who’ve had the vaccine have died or been seriously injured by it,” he says. “That’s an undeniable fact. Elderly people in care homes are dying in huge numbers. We’re told it’s the infection, but it’s not, of course, it’s the damned vaccine they’re being given.”
Coleman later claims there is a “horrifying avalanche of evidence showing that these damned vaccines are killing and maiming people” and says, “This is genocide.”
As his supposed proof, Coleman rattles off headlines from dubious websites proclaiming that people have died, without mentioning that the deaths have not been shown to be caused by the vaccine — and very likely are completely coincidental.
For example, Coleman cites an article from Health Impact News, a website known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, that misleadingly claims “181 Dead in the U.S. During 2 Week Period From Experimental COVID Injections.” The number comes from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which as we’ve written before, does not imply that the vaccine was necessarily responsible. Anyone can report through an online form and there is no vetting of the report. 
In another case, Coleman reads off a headline from another vaccine misinformation website about a man and woman in South Dakota dying a day after getting a vaccine. But he doesn’t mention that the state’s department of health concluded that immunization didn’t contribute to those deaths.
There is no evidence that authorized COVID-19 vaccines are harming people on any kind of wide scale. While many people have the expected sore arms or temporary flu-like symptoms following vaccination, serious side effects are uncommon.
A review of the vaccine safety monitoring data in the U.K. through the end of January found that the “overall safety experience” with the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines “is so far as expected from the clinical trials,” with the expected benefits “far outweigh[ing] any currently known side effects.”
According to the report, severe allergic reactions occurred in a small number of people, but these are very rare and have not resulted in death.
In the U.S., the vaccine safety monitoring data also is very encouraging. Dr. Paul Offit said in a Feb. 11 interview with JAMA that a recent review by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices had not revealed any safety signals from the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines.
One potential issue raised by the trials was that the vaccines might very occasionally trigger a usually temporary form of facial paralysis known as Bell’s Palsy. But so far, Offit said, there’s no sign that the condition is any more likely in people who get vaccinated. Data from the U.K. also support that finding.
According to a paper the CDC published in JAMA Insights, cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, following the vaccines in the U.S. are also very unusual  — 2.5 cases per million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4.7 cases per million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as of Jan. 18.
Officials in the U.S. are investigating a few instances of thrombocytopenia, or a lack of blood-clotting platelets, following vaccination, including one death. But it is still unknown whether that type of reaction can be due to COVID-19 vaccination. Even if it is, it would be an extremely rare event and experts say it would pose less risk than the chance of getting COVID-19 and suffering severe health consequences.
Update, May 14: After investigating 15 cases of a rare clotting condition out of nearly 8 million Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration are warning of a suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition, which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of April 21. The CDC says “women younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after vaccination, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are available where this risk has not been seen.” As of May 11, 28 cases had been identified out of more than 9 million J&J vaccines administered. For more, see “Q&A on the Rare Clotting Events That Caused the J&J Pause.” 
It’s true, of course, that people have died after receiving a vaccine — but this doesn’t mean the vaccine is to blame for the deaths. Every day, around 8,000 people in the U.S. die from a variety of causes. And as the University of California, San Francisco’s department of medicine chair Dr. Robert Wachter has pointed out, if 10 million people are vaccinated, in the following two months you’d expect 4,025 of those people to have a heart attack, 3,975 to have a stroke and 14,000 to die. “And the vaccines will have zero to do with any of them,” he wrote.
“There are always going to be these temporal associations, and you read about them in the newspaper,” said Offit. “But at least right now, those temporal associations have not been found to be causal associations.”
This is especially the case when vaccines are being given to older people who may not be in good health.
“Older age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur, especially given the millions of people vaccinated,” the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency explains in its report. “It is therefore important that we carefully review these reports to distinguish possible side effects from illness that would have occurred irrespective of vaccination.”
Other Claims
Throughout the video, Coleman makes a series of other false claims, including the long-debunked notion that COVID-19 “has been proved to be no more dangerous than the annual flu.” That’s wrong.
While scientists are still trying to pin down how deadly COVID-19 is, studies estimate that between 0.5% and 1.0% of people who are infected with the coronavirus will die — much more than influenza’s usually well below 0.1% mortality rate, as we’ve written. 
And the sheer number of deaths from COVID-19 far outstrip those for influenza. As of Feb. 11, more than 470,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to the CDC. That’s more than the estimated number of flu deaths from the past 10 flu seasons combined — and more than 20 times the number of deaths estimated to have occurred during the 2019-2020 flu season.
Coleman also cites statements from the World Health Organization to undermine and distort the facts on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
“The fact is that even the World Health Organization only expects these vaccines to help reduce the extent of the symptoms,” he says. “They’re not promising that the vaccine will stop people getting COVID-19 and they’re not expecting the vaccine to stop people spreading the infection if they do get it.”
No one can promise that a vaccine will prevent disease in all people, as no vaccine is 100% effective. But data from the trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, for example, found that vaccinated people were 94% or 95% less likely to develop symptoms of COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated.
It’s true that the vaccines may not prevent infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as the trials were primarily designed to show that the vaccines kept people from falling ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. (See our video on the distinction between virus and disease.) 
But it’s incorrect to say that the WHO is not expecting the vaccines to do anything for transmission. On webpages dedicated to the Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines, the agency simply says that there isn’t data or that it’s not known yet if vaccination will protect against onward transmission. The WHO has also said the same more broadly in press briefings. 
In fact, many scientists do expect COVID-19 vaccines to keep people from spreading the virus to at least some degree. That’s because it’s likely an infected but mildly ill or asymptomatic person would shed less virus and therefore be less contagious than a sicker unvaccinated person. But because this has not been demonstrated or known to what degree viral spread might be halted, public health officials have been upfront that it’s possible the vaccines may only prevent disease.

Coleman later claims there is a “horrifying avalanche of evidence showing that these damned vaccines are killing and maiming people” and says, “This is genocide.”
As his supposed proof, Coleman rattles off headlines from dubious websites proclaiming that people have died, without mentioning that the deaths have not been shown to be caused by the vaccine — and very likely are completely coincidental. Accessed 12 Feb 2021. For example, Coleman cites an article from Health Impact News, a website known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, that misleadingly claims “181 Dead in the U.S. During 2 Week Period From Experimental COVID Injections.” The number comes from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which as we’ve written before, does not imply that the vaccine was necessarily responsible. A review of the vaccine safety monitoring data in the U.K. through the end of January found that the “overall safety experience” with the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines “is so far as expected from the clinical trials,” with the expected benefits “far outweigh[ing  any currently known side effects.”
According to the report, severe allergic reactions occurred in a small number of people, but these are very rare and have not resulted in death. In making his argument, Coleman focuses on the fact that the COVID-19 trials are still ongoing, referring viewers to the U.S. government’s clinical trial registration page for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which says the completion date for the trial is nearly two years away, on Jan. 31, 2023."
247,CDC Hasn’t ‘Reduced’ COVID-19 Death Toll,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/cdc-hasnt-reduced-covid-19-death-toll/,,"Quick Take
Claims on social media have been spreading the falsehood that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention significantly lowered the COVID-19 death toll. There has been no such reduction. These claims confuse two different measures of the number of deaths.
Full Story
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly updates two different lists that track deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. One list, referred to as “provisional deaths,” counts death certificates. The other list counts confirmed and probable cases.
The list that counts death certificates shows a lower number partly because official documentation takes days or weeks to produce. So that number lags behind other methods of counting the death toll.
But several claims based on a faulty comparison of those two lists have been spreading the falsehood that the CDC has “adjusted” or “reduced” the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the U.S.
This message — made explicit in some posts and implicit in others — furthers the conspiracy theory that the pandemic was planned or is a hoax.
For example, one Facebook post said, “The CDC has adjusted their COVID19 deaths from 64,000 to 37,000. What do you think about that? Still scared? Angry yet?” It generated this response from a reader: “WHAT A DAMM HOAX!!! ALL OF IT!”
But it’s not true.
The claim received widespread attention after it was highlighted by the popular right-wing personality Dinesh D’Souza. On May 2, he tweeted: “Just like that, CDC reduces its #Coronavirus death count to 37,000. That’s nearly HALF the total they were peddling. Did 30,000 people spring back to life like Lazarus? No, this seems a ‘gaffe’ — defined as a case of the CDC accidentally telling the truth.”
A few minutes after he posted the tweet, another user responded with a screenshot showing 62,406 deaths on the CDC’s list of confirmed and probable cases. D’Souza replied with a screenshot of the CDC’s other list, counting death certificates, that showed 37,308 deaths. He wrote, “See for yourself.”
But, as we said, those two lists are different. The first one shows the number of deaths from COVID-19 based on information collected from states and territories reporting both confirmed and probable cases. The second one shows the number of death certificates that list COVID-19 as the cause of death.
As the CDC explained, the count based on death certificates has a one- to two-week lag behind the numbers shown in lists that use other methods for counting because:

“Death certificates take time to be completed.”
“Waiting for test results can create additional delays.”
“It takes extra time to code COVID-19 deaths. While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS [the National Center for Health Statistics] within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded manually, which takes an average of 7 days.”

Archived versions of the two lists confirm that there has been no decrease in the death toll total and that the number shown in the list counting death certificates does, indeed, lag the other by about two weeks. For example, as of April 20, the list showing confirmed and probable cases put the death toll at 39,083. Two weeks later, on May 4, the list showing the number of death certificates put the toll at 38,576.
Still, the bogus claim continues to circulate, including in the form of a screenshot meme that was created from the headline on the conservative website waynedupree.com, which has since issued a correction.
And, on May 4, a conservative radio show repeated the claim in a story that has garnered more than 100,000 likes, shares, and comments on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle.
Neither the radio show nor D’Souza responded to our request for comment.

248,Trump Spins ER Statistic to Claim U.S. Is in ‘Great Shape’ on COVID-19,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-spins-er-statistic-to-claim-u-s-is-in-great-shape-on-covid-19/,,"At recent campaign rallies, President Donald Trump has made the misleading boast that the U.S. is in “great shape” because 97% of emergency room visits were for something other than COVID-19. But the number is not as impressive as it sounds. Trump could have boasted of similar percentages — 93% to 96% — during the worst periods of the pandemic.
With Election Day a week away, the president continued his efforts to paint an overly rosy picture of the coronavirus pandemic in two Oct. 27 campaign rallies.
In each, Trump repeated the false notion that the U.S. is “rounding the corner” or “rounding the turn” on the pandemic and debuted a new statistic to ostensibly support his position.
“Thanks to our relentless efforts, 97% of all current emergency rooms visits are for something other than the virus,” the president said before a crowd in West Salem, Wisconsin. “You don’t hear these numbers from the fake news. Think of that, 97%.”
He touted the statistic again — almost verbatim — a few hours later in a campaign rally in Omaha, Nebraska, adding, “Think of that, 97%. We’re in great shape.” 
The next day, in Arizona, the president used the same lines again.
Trump’s statistic is correct, but it’s not the meaningful indicator he presents it as. Even during the pandemic’s harrowing days in April, the percentage of ER visits due to a COVID-like illness never went higher than 7%. And the number, while lower now, has been on the rise. 
Moreover, public health experts do not think that the U.S. is in “great shape” — and a bevy of metrics show that the pandemic is worsening.
The Trump campaign did not respond to our inquiry asking for the source of the 97% number, but it likely comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the agency’s data tracker, which has data up to Oct. 26, around 3% of ER visits in the past week or so were due to a COVID-like illness.
While that may sound low, it represents an uptick from two months ago, when the figure hovered around 2%. 
The estimate comes from one of the CDC’s surveillance systems, the National Syndromic Surveillance Project, which in an effort to track potential COVID-19 visits, monitors emergency department visits for COVID-19-like illness in a subset of hospitals in 47 states. 
COVID-like illness is defined as a person having a fever and cough or shortness of breath or a coronavirus diagnosis code. Visits that meet the symptom criteria but mention influenza are not counted in the tally.  
As the CDC explains elsewhere, the surveillance system is “currently being affected by changes in health care seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine and increased social distancing,” which changes the number of people visiting the ER.
The ER visit data also appear in a weekly surveillance report from the CDC known as COVIDView. According to the most recently available report, which covers the week ending on Oct. 24, 3% of ER visits were for a COVID-like illness. 
A graph covering the pandemic period shows that the percentage of such visits each week peaked at 6.8% in April before declining and then hitting another peak of 4.2% in July. That means that even during the worst periods of the pandemic thus far, Trump would have been able to tout that 93% to 96% of ER visits were not related to COVID-19.

The weekly report notes that the percentage of ER visits due to potential COVID-19 cases “has been increasing since mid-September.”
The rest of the report strikes a cautionary tone. “Nationally, surveillance indicators tracking levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation and associated illnesses have been increasing since September,” the report concluded, referring to the virus that causes COVID-19, adding that COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths for the most recent weeks “may increase as more data are received.”
In selectively highlighting a figure that sounds impressive, Trump misleads about the reality of the pandemic in the U.S., which by all indications is getting worse, not better.
A set of Oct. 25 coronavirus task force reports obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, for example, found that a whopping 32 states are in the “red zone” for COVID-19 cases — more than in any other publicly available report to date.
And according to the COVID Tracking Project, the seven-day average of new daily cases in the U.S. topped 76,000 on Oct. 29, blowing past the previous rolling average record of around 66,500 cases per day in July. The number of people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 is also climbing, and daily deaths are now up from fewer than 700 earlier in October to around 800.
An analysis from Johns Hopkins University also shows that over the past week, almost all states have shown an increase in reported COVID-19 cases.
As he has before, Trump has recently claimed, including in an Oct. 30 tweet, that the reason why cases are up is because of testing.

More Testing equals more Cases. We have best testing. Deaths WAY DOWN. Hospitals have great additional capacity! Doing much better than Europe. Therapeutics working!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2020

There is more testing now than earlier in the pandemic, but as a COVID Tracking Project blog post on Oct. 27 explains, expanded testing does not explain all or even most of the observed surge in cases.
“Since October 1, the seven-day average for new cases has risen 61 percent, while tests are only up 14 percent in the same period,” the post reads. “Meanwhile, the number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19 has risen 40 percent in October thus far.”
Indeed, the uptick in hospitalizations and deaths also demonstrates that the surge in cases is not simply an artifact of testing. 
Members of the Trump administration have said as much, including Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus task force member in charge of testing. “We do believe and the data show that the cases are going up. It’s not just a function of testing,” he said in an Oct. 28 interview on NBC’s “Today” show. “Yes, we’re getting more cases identified, but the cases are actually going up. And we know that, too, because hospitalizations are going up.”


The number of daily deaths is much lower than the more than 2,000 people lost per day in April, but as we’ve noted before, deaths lag cases.
Some locales, such as El Paso, Texas, are reporting that hospitals are beginning to run out of space, with some setting up field hospitals or sending patients to less burdened facilities, including those out of state. Utah is drawing up plans to ration medical care, contrary to Trump’s claim that all is fine with hospitals and they “have great additional capacity!”
We’ve previously explained when Trump made the same baseless claim that the U.S. is “rounding the corner” on the pandemic that public health officials and experts do not agree with that assessment. Those opinions have not changed. 
Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, for example, said in a Twitter thread that there “is a new real and serious surge in severe COVID” and called for leaders to take more steps to ensure that members of the public take more precautions to quell the outbreaks.
And in an Oct. 28 interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci repeated his concerns for the future.
“We’re not in a good place,” he said of the current situation, pointing to the high number of daily cases. “We should have been way down in baseline and daily cases. And we’re not.”
“We’re going into a precarious situation where much of what we’re going to be doing is going to be indoors as opposed to outdoors,” Fauci added, referring to the upcoming months of colder weather for much of the nation. “And wherever you go in the country — you call up, you talk to your friends in the trenches — they’re telling you that they’re seeing cases going up virtually at all ages, all groups, at the same time. That’s not good. And then the third thing you superimpose upon that, as we go into the holiday season, where naturally the tradition and the customs are for gatherings and traveling. Again, all a bad recipe for a tough time ahead.”

249,Trump’s Misleading Ventilator Counter-Punch at Cuomo,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-misleading-ventilator-counter-punch-at-cuomo/,,"Hitting back at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pleas for the federal government to provide more ventilators, President Donald Trump misleadingly claimed Cuomo rejected a 2015 recommendation to purchase 15,000 ventilators and instead “established death panels” and “lotteries.” 
Contrary to the president’s claim, a task force in 2015 did not make a recommendation about purchasing more ventilators. The report — “Ventilator Allocation Guidelines” — provided guidelines for New York hospitals on how they should decide which patients get ventilators in the event of a severe influenza pandemic.
The coronavirus pandemic has exploded in New York, where nearly half of the more than 81,000 confirmed cases in the U.S. were located, as of March 26.
Cuomo said at a press conference on March 24 that the state had an urgent need for more ventilators to deal with an anticipated peak in demand in two weeks for patients needing help to breathe. The state will need at least 30,000 ventilators, he said, and it so far had obtained 7,000.
“There is no other way for us to get these ventilators,” Cuomo said. “We’ve tried everything else. The only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government. Period.”
Cuomo said the federal government had, to that point, only provided an additional 400 ventilators, though Vice President Mike Pence said in an interview on Fox News later that day that the federal government would be sending 4,000 more to New York in the next two days.
Cuomo ‘Rejected’ Ventilator Recommendation?
Speaking at a Fox News virtual town hall hours after Cuomo made his comments, Trump said that despite Cuomo’s “complaining,” the federal government was “doing probably more — definitely more for [New York] — than anybody else.”
Trump said that while the federal government is and will continue to help New York, Cuomo “is supposed to be buying his own ventilators.” 
While saying he was “not blaming” Cuomo for the shortage of ventilators, Trump added that in 2015 Cuomo “refused to order 15,000 ventilators” so “he shouldn’t be talking about us.”
 Reading from an article on a conservative website, Trump said Cuomo “rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for a pandemic” and that he “established death panels and lotteries instead.” 
Trump on Fox News, March 24: So he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else, but he shouldn’t be talking about us. He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We’re going to help. …
We’re working very, very hard for the people of New York. We’re working along with him, and then I watch him on the show, complaining. And he had 16,000 ventilators that he could have had at a great price and he didn’t buy them.
That’s a misleading framing of an effort in 2015 in New York to provide guidelines for which patients should get ventilators in the event of a shortage during a severe pandemic.
But let’s unravel Trump’s comments a bit.
The president read directly from the headline of a story in the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, which originally stated, “NY Gov. Cuomo Rejected Buying Recommended 16,000 Ventilators in 2015 for Pandemic, Established Death Panels and Lottery Instead.”
The article was about a syndicated column by Betsy McCaughey, a former Republican lieutenant governor of New York, who wrote:
McCaughey, March 18: After learning that the state’s stockpile of medical equipment had 16,000 fewer ventilators than New Yorkers would need in a severe pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo came to a fork in the road in 2015. He could have chosen to buy more ventilators. Instead, he asked his health commissioner, Howard Zucker to assemble a task force and draft rules for rationing the ventilators they already had.
That task force came up with rules that will be imposed when ventilators run short. Patients assigned a red code will have the highest access, and other patients will be assigned green, yellow or blue (the worst) depending on a “triage officer’s” decision. In truth, a death officer. Let’s not sugarcoat it. It won’t be up to your own doctor.
Cuomo could have purchased the additional 16,000 needed ventilators for $36,000 apiece or a total of $576 million in 2015. It’s a lot of money but less than the $750 million he threw away on a boondoggle “Buffalo Billion” solar panel factory. When it comes to state budget priorities, spending half a percent of the budget on ventilators is a no brainer.
McCaughey is referring to “Ventilator Allocation Guidelines,” a 272-page report produced by the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law and the New York State Department of Health in 2015. The group modeled the demands that would be placed on the New York health care system under moderate and severe influenza pandemic scenarios.
 The severe scenario was based on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The analysis concluded that during a severe influenza pandemic, there would likely be a shortfall of 15,783 ventilators during the peak week of demand.


Using the assumption that there would be a shortage of ventilators in a severe influenza pandemic, the task force created the guidelines to provide “an ethical and clinical framework” for deciding which patients would get one. The guidelines were “crafted to provide the greatest benefit to as many patients as possible” and to “limit loss of life in the face of such a mass disaster,” according to an FAQ section on the report.
But contrary to the president’s claim, the task force did not make a recommendation about purchasing more ventilators. That was outside the scope of the report, Valerie Gutmann Koch, the former senior attorney and special consultant to the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, told us via email.
Trump “obviously didn’t read the document he’s citing,” Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Cuomo, said in a statement to The Hill. “This was a 5 year old advisory task force report, which never recommended the State procure ventilators — it merely referenced that New York wouldn’t be equipped with enough ventilators for a 1918 flu pandemic. No one is, including Mr. Trump.”
The report states that New York added 2,000 ventilators between 2007 — when the first draft guidelines were developed — and 2015, enough so that there would not be a shortage in the event of a moderate influenza pandemic. However, the report states, “there are no current plans to buy enough ventilators for the most severe model.”
“The State’s current approach to stockpiling a limited number of ventilators balances the need to prepare for a potential pandemic against the need to maintain adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses,” the report states. “Furthermore, severe staffing shortages are anticipated, and purchasing additional ventilators beyond a threshold will not save additional lives, because there will not be a sufficient number of trained staff to operate them.”
In the FAQ section accompanying the report, the task force stated:
Q: Can the State stockpile as many ventilators as would be needed in a severe pandemic?
A: Even if New York State purchases additional ventilators, the demand would quickly outpace supply in a severe pandemic. No matter how many ventilators are available, in a severe pandemic there will be shortages because so many people will be sick at the same time. In addition, even with enough ventilators, a sufficient number of trained staff may not be available to operate them, particularly because health care workers will be among the ill.
Q: What can hospitals do to reduce the demand for ventilators in a pandemic?
A: Before the Guidelines are implemented, hospitals should practice “surge capacity” to reduce the need for ventilators. For example, elective procedures that require ventilators should be canceled and/or postponed during the period of emergency. For a moderate pandemic, surge capacity practices may be enough to meet the increased demand for ventilators. However, in the event of a severe pandemic, surge capacity measures would still fall short of addressing the anticipated demand for ventilators.
Asked in a press conference on March 25 about the task force and whether it had suggested New York should increase its stockpile of ventilators, Cuomo responded, “that’s not the fact.”
“There was an advisory commission called … Life and the Law, that had a chart in 2015 that said, if you had the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, you may need ‘X’ number of ventilators,” Cuomo said. “There’s no state in the United States that bought ventilators for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The federal government did not buy ventilators for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Nobody in the world bought ventilators in preparation for a 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.”
Not mentioned by the president was that McCaughey, in the fuller op-ed that appeared in the New York Post, was also critical of the federal government’s preparedness.
Wrote McCaughey: “To be fair, governments everywhere stockpiled too little. Washington didn’t do much better: The federal Strategic National Stockpile is undersupplied to meet the coronavirus emergency.”
Although the New York report did not explicitly recommend the purchase of additional ventilators, one of the task force members, Samuel Gorovitz, a philosophy professor at Syracuse University, told us via email that he wishes leaders at the time had reflected “about the overall context” of the report and decided additional purchases were “a prudent thing to do.”
A New York Times analysis of the 2015 task force report and a study by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security concluded that New York has slightly fewer ventilators per capita than the national average.
Death Panels?
It’s also misleading to describe the triage committees overseeing the ventilator allocation guidelines as “death panels.”
“I am clear that it [the 2015 report] did not recommend ‘death panels’ or anything that could plausibly be described that way,” Gorovitz, who served on the task force, told us. “Like the Covid-19 guidelines under development now, it anticipated the possible need to make tragic decisions. And if Gov. Cuomo had bought 20,000 ventilators in 2015, we would still need to be prepared to face and make such decisions. Better to be thoughtful about how to minimize their awfulness than to pretend the need can be avoided.”
“Death panels” — a term the Gateway Pundit used to describe the New York guidelines and which was repeated by Trump — is a phrase that was popularized — misleadingly so — by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in 2009 to describe Medicare payments for end-of-life counseling by physicians as part of the then-proposed Affordable Care Act. Palin later used the term to criticize a panel created under the new health care law to slow the growth of Medicare spending, claiming, wrongly, that it would be used to ration health care.
Koch, the senior attorney for the task force who is currently the director of law and ethics at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago and faculty fellow at DePaul University College of Law, also said it is inaccurate to call the triage committees proposed by the New York task force “death panels.”
“The 2015 ventilator allocation protocol is intended to save the most lives in an influenza pandemic where there are a limited number of available ventilators,” Koch told us. “It is grounded in a solid ethical and legal foundation and balance the goal of saving the most lives with important societal values, such as protecting vulnerable populations, to build support from both the general public and health care staff. The recommendations are based on a number of important ethical principles, identified through years of deliberation and analysis, and with significant public outreach.
“The duty to steward resources is the need to responsibly manage resources during periods of true scarcity,” Koch said. “The duty to plan is the responsibility of government to plan for a foreseeable crisis. Distributive justice requires that an allocation system is applied broadly and consistently to be fair to all. Transparency ensures that the process of developing a clinical ventilator allocation protocol is open to feedback and revision, which helps promote public trust in the guidelines. The guidelines recommend triage officers/committees to implement the protocol in order to ensure fairness and equality. To ensure that patients receive the best care possible in a pandemic, the guidelines provide that a patient’s attending physician does not determine whether his/her patient receives or continues with ventilator therapy; instead, a triage officer or triage committee makes the decision.”
An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 23 advocated the nationwide development of “strategies for rationing during pandemics” and cited the New York task force’s efforts as an example.
“Though some people may denounce triage committees as ‘death panels,’ in fact they would be just the opposite — their goal would be to save the most lives possible in a time of unprecedented crisis,” the authors wrote.
It is also inaccurate, Koch told us in an email, to describe the guidelines proposed by the task force as a “lottery,” as the headline Trump cited did.
Koch, March 25: The task force examined various nonclinical approaches to allocating ventilators. These included distributing ventilators on a first-come first-served basis, randomizing ventilator allocation (sometimes known as a lottery), requiring only informal clinical judgment in making decisions about ventilator allocation, and prioritizing certain patient categories, such as health care workers, older patients, and those with certain social criteria. The task force, however, rejected these methods, saying that they should not be used as the primary triage strategy because they are often subjective and/or do not support the goal of saving the most lives. Thus, it is wholly inaccurate to describe the guidelines as a lottery system. Rather, the allocation protocol uses only clinical factors to evaluate a patient’s likelihood of survival and determine his or her access to ventilator therapy. Under the Guidelines, under no circumstance will a decision regarding ventilator allocation be based on non-clinical factors such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, perceived quality of life, ability to pay, or role in the community.
The guidelines did envision using a lottery in limited circumstances. Although “[a] patient’s likelihood of survival … is the most important consideration when evaluating a patient … there may be a situation where multiple patients have been assigned a red color code, which indicates they all have the highest level of access to ventilator therapy, and they all have equal (or near equal) likelihoods of survival.” 
“If the eligible patient pool consists of only adults or only children, a randomization process, such as a lottery, is used each time a ventilator becomes available because there are no other evidence–based clinical factors available to consider,” the guidelines state. 
Low-Price Ventilators?
As for Trump’s claim that Cuomo in 2015 “had a chance to buy” 16,000 ventilators “at a very low price,” and that “he had 16,000 ventilators that he could have had at a great price and he didn’t buy them,” to be clear, there was no discount being offered for the purchase of 16,000 ventilators back in 2015.
The federal government also has a cache of ventilators in the CDC’s Strategic National Stockpile. The government does not publicize the contents of the federal stockpile, but Dr. Richard Branson, a professor of surgery emeritus at the University of Cincinnati and the editor-in-chief of the journal Respiratory Care, told Politico there are believed to be around 20,000 ventilators in the national emergency stockpile.
Research published in Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2017 concluded that the number of ventilators in the national stockpile “might not suffice to meet demand during a severe public health emergency.” The Wall Street Journal reported on March 23 that state officials in Washington and Massachusetts “say they have received a fraction of what they sought from the national stockpile,” including for medical equipment.
Using CDC estimates on the projected scope of the coronavirus pandemic, the authors of a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine projected that in the U.S. “the number of patients needing ventilation could range between 1.4 and 31 patients per ventilator.”
“Whether it will be necessary to ration ventilators will depend on the pace of the pandemic and how many patients need ventilation at the same time, but many analysts warn that the risk is high,” the authors wrote.
To sum up, while the task force report did highlight a shortage of ventilators in the event of a severe influenza pandemic, it did not recommend whether the state should buy more ventilators (and hire the staff necessary to operate them). And it is misleading to call those guidelines a “death panel” or “lotteries.”",Robert Farley,2020-03-26 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"Asked in a press conference on March 25 about the task force and whether it had suggested New York should increase its stockpile of ventilators, Cuomo responded, “that’s not the fact.”
“There was an advisory commission called … Life and the Law, that had a chart in 2015 that said, if you had the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, you may need ‘X’ number of ventilators,” Cuomo said.

250,FactChecking Trump’s COVID-19 Press Briefing,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/factchecking-trumps-covid-19-press-briefing/,,"President Donald Trump, at a July 28 briefing, made a few false and misleading statements about COVID-19:

Trump falsely said that “large portions” of the country are “corona-free.” Only 230 counties or county equivalents, accounting for less than 0.5% of the population, have not reported a coronavirus case in the past week.
The president claimed, without evidence, that Portland and Seattle were seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases because of protests. The health departments for both areas told us that the available data do not show that protests are responsible for an uptick in cases.
Trump said he didn’t know Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position on hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug that the president has claimed, contrary to scientific evidence, is effective against COVID-19. In fact, Fauci has said — at briefings attended by Trump — that there is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine works for COVID-19.

‘Large Portions’ of U.S. Not ‘Corona-Free’
In putting a positive spin on the current coronavirus situation, Trump inaccurately suggested that large parts of the U.S. no longer have any transmission of the coronavirus.
Trump, July 28: We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country; it’s — it’s corona-free. But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it’s starting to head down.
The president is correct that some hotspots are improving. As of July 29, Arizona, California, Texas and Florida all show a downward trend in cases, according to an analysis by Johns Hopkins University.
But the notion that “large portions” of the U.S. are rid of the virus is false. We asked the White House where the coronavirus-free areas were, and did not receive a response.
Using county-level data from USAFacts, a not-for-profit that supplies data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we found that only 230 of the nation’s 3,142 counties or county equivalents have not reported a single coronavirus case for the week ending on July 28, the most recent day with data.
These counties are concentrated in the sparsely populated West, including numerous counties or their equivalents in Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas. Collectively, the 230 counties or county equivalents account for 0.42% of the total U.S. population.
The most populous county not to report a coronavirus case in the past week is Newport County, Rhode Island, which is home to around 82,000 residents.
A coronavirus task force report from July 26 also underscores how far the U.S. is from being coronavirus-free. Only one state — Vermont — is listed as being in the “green zone” for coronavirus cases, with 10 or fewer per 100,000 people in the last week. 
The rest of the nation is either in the “yellow zone” or “red zone,”’ with between 10 and 100 cases per 100,000 people, or more than 100 cases per 100,000 people, respectively. Since the last public report from July 14, the number of “red zone” states for cases has increased, from 18 to 21.
As of July 29, the U.S. is posting a seven-day average of just over 64,000 new coronavirus cases per day, according to the COVID-19 Tracking Project.
No Evidence Protests Have Triggered Rise in COVID-19 Cases
Just after emphasizing the improvements in hotspots, Trump said that protests in certain cities were responsible for an increase in coronavirus cases.
“In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle,” he said, “we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on.”
Both cities have observed a recent rise in cases, but health department officials told us there was no indication that it was due to protests.
“The available data does not support the assertion that protests in Seattle are driving our recent increase in cases,” said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, the health officer for public health for Seattle and King County, in an email to FactCheck.org. “Although we recognize that COVID-19 transmission at large outdoor gatherings is possible and advise people to avoid such gatherings and take precautions if they participate, our investigations and data from our testing sites have found relatively small numbers of cases associated with these events.”
Duchin said that of the approximately 5,000 people who said they attended a protest event and were tested at a city-sponsored testing site, only 0.2% were positive for COVID-19. Further, Duchin said that case investigations were finding that a majority of the recent cases could be tied to a general increase in activity in the community, “particularly family and social gatherings, household exposures and workplace transmissions.”
Multnomah County Public Health Director Rachael Banks told us much the same was true in Portland.
“We’re seeing an increase in cases, but there’s no evidence that the increase is due to residents who are protesting,” she said in a phone interview, adding that every county resident who tests positive for COVID-19 is interviewed, and that since June 1, the department hasn’t identified any clusters associated with protests.
Since June 1, Banks said only 19 of the county’s more than 2,000 cases have reported attending a mass gathering such as a protest — or less than 1%. Instead, she said, case clusters have been linked to work site exposures, including food production plants, and to households and social networks.
Banks also questioned why her city was being highlighted by the president, as many other counties have worse outbreaks, including Orange County, California, and Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, Arizona.
Trump has previously tried to blame Black Lives Matter protests for spreading the coronavirus. But as we have written, despite initial fears that that might be the case, there isn’t evidence that it has happened.
Hydroxychloroquine
Trump also stated that he didn’t know Dr. Anthony Fauci’s position on hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug Trump has volubly supported, without evidence, as a powerful weapon against COVID-19.
Trump was at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on March 20 when Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there was no evidence that hydroxychloroquine was effective against COVID-19. And at another briefing on April 6, Trump cut off Fauci, a member of the task force, when he was asked about the drug, saying Fauci had answered the question “15 times.”
At the July 28 press briefing, there was this exchange:
Reporter, July 28: On that note, Mr. President, last night, in tweets that were deleted by Twitter, you said that Dr. Fauci misled the country about hydroxychloroquine. How so?
Trump: No, not at all. I think — I don’t even know what his stance is on it.
Fauci has long been known as a skeptic on the merits of using hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. He made that clear at the March 20 briefing attended by Trump.
Reporter, March 20: And to Dr. Fauci, if I could. Dr. Fauci — this was explained yesterday — there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?
Fauci: No. The answer is no. And the evidence that you’re talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. So as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we’re trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective.
But the information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.
At that briefing, Fauci also challenged the notion that hydroxychloroquine had proven valuable in treating SARS.
Reporter: It was also fairly effective against SARS.
Trump: It was a very — it was, as I understand that. Is that a correct statement — it was fairly effective on SARS?
Fauci: John, you’ve got to be careful when you say “fairly effective.” It was never done in a clinical trial.
At the April 6 briefing, Trump made clear that he had heard more than enough about Fauci’s views on hydroxychloroquine.
Reporter, April 6: And would you also weigh in on this issue of hydroxychloroquine? What do you think about this? And what is the — what is the medical evidence?
Trump: Do you know how many times you’ve answered that question?
Fauci: Yeah —
Reporter: But I’d love to hear from the doctor.
Trump: Maybe 15. Fifteen times. You don’t have to ask the question.
Reporter: He’s — he’s your medical expert, correct?
Trump: He’s answered that question 15 times.
Fauci reiterated this week that the scientific evidence doesn’t support using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. In a July 28 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Fauci said, “The overwhelming, prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.”
Despite the lack of scientific support, Trump has long touted hydroxychloroquine as a promising option in combating COVID-19, calling it a potential “game changer.” He said in May that he himself took the drug as a preventive measure.
We have written previously on a number of occasions about Trump’s enthusiasm for the drug and the lack of evidence of its efficacy. (See “Trump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim,” “Trump Gets Ahead of Himself on COVID-19 Therapies,” “Trump Misleads on Hydroxychloriquine, Again.”) Yet Trump’s support for the drug is undiminished.
The president again said at the July 28 briefing, “I happen to believe in it.”
“Many doctors think it is extremely successful — the hydroxychloroquine — coupled with the zinc and perhaps the azithromycin,” Trump said. “But many doctors think it’s extremely good, and some people don’t. Some people — I think it’s become very political.”
As we have written, on July 27 Trump retweeted a widely shared video featuring a doctor falsely claiming hydroxychloroquine is a “cure” for COVID-19. The video has been taken down by Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. This was one of a series of retweets by Trump of tweets supporting the drug.
Numerous studies have cast serious doubt on its effectiveness when it comes to treating COVID-19.
“There are no data from randomized clinical trials that demonstrate effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for COVID,” Dr. Neil Schluger, chairman of the department of medicine at New York Medical College School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. Schluger has studied hydroxychloroquine in relation to COVID-19. “There are now several randomized clinical trials that show that it had no effect.”
“The vast majority of expert opinions … is that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit in COVID illness,” he added.
As we have reported, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization in March to allow adult and some adolescent patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to obtain hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile “when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.”
Amid growing evidence the drug is not effective, the FDA announced in June that it had revoked the EUA for the drugs because they are “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19,” and that the “known and potential benefits” of the drugs “no longer outweigh” the risks — which can include “serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects.”
Fauci has long made clear his doubts about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, and Trump has heard him.
Correction, Aug. 11: We initially miscalculated the number of counties that did not have any coronavirus cases in the past week.

251,Misinformation on COVID-19 Death Protocols in New York,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/misinformation-on-covid-19-death-protocols-in-new-york/,,"Quick Take
A viral Facebook post about COVID-19 falsely claims that in New York “every contaminated corpse belongs to the state” and will be incinerated without any “wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects.” The state is allowing funeral services with limited visitors; cremation is not mandated.


Full Story 
New York state has reported more than 100,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and nearly 3,000 deaths. New York City in particular has been described as an epicenter for the outbreak in the U.S.
But as New Yorkers navigate the public health crisis, a viral Facebook post is adding further alarm by spreading misinformation about what happens when someone dies from the disease. The repeatedly posted image claims that those who die will become property of the state and be incinerated without any “wakes or memorial services.”
That’s wrong, according to local and state agencies, as well as groups representing medical examiners and funeral directors.
The post uses a picture recently published by BuzzFeed News, which the outlet attributed to a New York City nurse, that is said to show COVID-19 victims in a refrigerated truck outside a city hospital.
“New York coronovirus victims,” the post reads. “They’re not letting you bury your own. There will be no wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects. Every contaminated corpse belongs to the state and will be exposed of in a incinerator.”
That’s not true.

Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, called the claim “ridiculous.” Mike Lanotte, the director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, told us in an email: “I have not seen or heard anything regarding that claim. We are still operating under the state’s guidelines.”
Jeffrey Hammond, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health, noted that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s March 20 executive order — which required non-essential businesses statewide to close — “does not apply to essential businesses or entities providing essential services or functions. Pursuant to Empire State Development Corporation (ESD) guidance, essential services include ‘funeral homes, crematoriums and cemeteries.'”
“Thus, funeral homes may continue to operate and hold services,” Hammond said in an email. “However, they should postpone services when possible. If services must be held, funeral homes should limit the size of any services or gatherings to as few participants as possible (e.g. immediate family).”
Scott Schmidt, president of the New York State Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners, also told us that, to date, there has been no directive like the one described in the Facebook posts.
There is “NOTHING stating the State owns any body and will incinerate it upon verification of being infected with Covid-19,” Schmidt said in an email. “Funeral Directors, Coroners and Medical Examiners have been briefed on proper handling procedures for such cases as have Cemetery and Crematory Operators.”
In New York City, there have been numerous news reports about how the volume of deaths has overworked the system and transformed farewells for families. The demand has required the procurement of mobile morgues and created backlogs for cemeteries and crematoriums. Some cemeteries are not allowing visitors.
But the state hasn’t forbidden funeral homes or cemeteries from allowing services altogether. While the state encourages services be postponed or limited to immediate family, as we said, its Division of Cemeteries notes that “funeral homes and cemeteries may continue to operate and hold services.”
Lanotte, of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, said he was aware of “some cemeteries that are no longer, for safety reasons, allowing visitors.” While a Daily Beast report noted one funeral home’s decision to end visitation, that does not appear to be a widespread practice across the city or state. Lanotte said he has not “heard directly yet of any funeral homes ending visitations. I do know they have adjusted to the new guidelines and are offering private viewings/ceremonies for immediate family only.”
In some cases, funeral homes are following those guidelines but allowing those beyond immediate family to partake remotely by using Facebook Live or Zoom.

252,Trump Misleads on H1N1 Swine Flu Testing,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/trump-misleads-on-h1n1-swine-flu-testing/,,"Deflecting attention from the rise in COVID-19 cases, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said the Obama administration “stopped testing” during the H1N1 pandemic. He’s correct that individual reporting was halted after a few months, but some testing did continue — and the two viruses are very different, making the comparison misleading.
Whereas pandemic H1N1 influenza was no worse than the seasonal flu, and testing did not play much of a role in controlling the spread of the virus, COVID-19 is far more deadly, and testing is critical for contact tracing and isolation.
Trump first mentioned the Obama administration’s decision to halt reporting of individual H1N1 influenza cases at a July 13 roundtable on law enforcement, when the president was asked by a reporter whether he would acknowledge that coronavirus cases were rising because of increased spread of the virus, and not just because of testing, as Trump has frequently claimed.
In response, Trump falsely said that the U.S. has one of the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates — it does not — and then proceeded to say that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden “stopped testing” during the 2009 pandemic. 
Trump, July 13: If you know, Biden and Obama stopped their testing; they just stopped it. You probably know that. I’m sure you don’t want to report it. But they stopped testing. Right in the middle, they just went, “No more testing,” and on a much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously with respect to — this is the worst thing that’s happened since probably 1917. This is a very bad — all over the world. It’s 188 countries right now.
The next day at a press conference in the Rose Garden, Trump brought it up again, this time specifying that he was talking about H1N1.
Trump, July 14: And if you look at the job [Joe Biden] did on swine flu — I looked at a poll — they have polls on everything nowadays — and he — they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it “N1H1.” H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, “Stop.”
As we have written, the president has made inapt comparisons between COVID-19 and H1N1 before, and the polling claim is trumped up. No polls specifically evaluated Biden’s performance in the 2009 pandemic, but the Obama administration received moderately good marks at the time.
Trump’s latest H1N1 claim appears to stem from a Fox News article that Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany shared in a July 11 tweet. 
“Under Obama/Biden, ‘the CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases,’ she said, quoting the news story. “Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump⁩ has tested 40 million+, leading the world in testing!”
The White House did not respond to our inquiry for more information.
Different Viruses, Different Roles For Testing
It’s true that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped having states report H1N1 cases in late July 2009, a little more than three months after the first U.S. pandemic influenza virus cases were identified in April. 
But the CDC did not “totally” stop testing, since some testing continued for surveillance purposes and for select patients. And Trump is omitting relevant context as to why the CDC made that decision — and how the circumstances are different this time around with COVID-19.
The CDC explains in an archived webpage that individual cases of H1N1 pandemic influenza were monitored early on to track the spread of the disease, but as the virus became widespread, the case counts “became an increasingly inaccurate representation of the true burden of disease” as many people were mildly ill and did not seek treatment and the vast majority were not tested.
“CDC recognized early in the outbreak that once disease was widespread,” the website continues, “it would be more valuable to transition to standard surveillance systems to monitor illness, hospitalizations and deaths.”
On another webpage, the CDC says that individual case counts became “increasingly impractical and not representative of the true extent of the outbreak” because only a small proportion of patients were tested for influenza, “so the true benefit of keeping track of these numbers is questionable.” 
The webpage added that the “extensive spread” of the virus made it “extremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases,” and that the agency would continue to track H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths.
Dr. Anne Schuchat, then-director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and now principal deputy director of the CDC, also explained the change in a July 24, 2009, press call, noting that at that point in the pandemic there had been 43,771 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza and 302 deaths in the U.S.
“But as we’ve been saying, that’s really just the tip of the iceberg, so we’re no longer going to expect the states will continue this individual reporting and we’re going to transition to other ways of describing the illness and the pattern,” she said. “We believe there have been well over a million cases of the new H1N1 virus so far in the United States.”
The decision followed the World Health Organization’s July 16 announcement that it would no longer issue global reports on the number of confirmed H1N1 cases, given the difficulty of testing such a large number of cases, and the fact that such counts were “no longer essential in such countries for monitoring either the level or nature of the risk posed by the pandemic virus or to guide implementation of the most appropriate response measures.”
The CDC would go on to report estimates of the number of H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. throughout the pandemic, specifically trying to use statistical methods to account for underreporting.
Dr. Nicole Lurie, a physician and assistant secretary for preparedness and response during the H1N1 pandemic, told us the comparison to COVID-19 is “really misleading.”
“The role of testing in those two diseases is terribly different,” she said in a phone interview. “In flu, the major reason that they tested people at the beginning of the epidemic was so that you would know when influenza arrived in different communities.”
But once the virus had arrived and established itself, she said, doctors could “make a pretty good presumption” that people with flu-like symptoms had flu.
“Individual testing was no longer needed because it was just wasteful and provided no additional information,” said Lurie, who is now a strategic advisor to the CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to developing vaccines to stop epidemics, including COVID-19.
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, also told us that testing for H1N1 was not particularly valuable because the virus was so prevalent, and there was a readily available therapy — Tamiflu and other similar antivirals, which also work on seasonal flu.
“The testing was onerous,” he said, noting that a confirmatory diagnostic test could take days to come back with results. “The rapid tests were not very accurate, and we had an antiviral, and we didn’t want people to refrain from giving them an antiviral because they were waiting for a test or the test result was negative.”
There are no FDA-approved drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19, although research suggests the investigational drug remdesivir may shorten the time to recovery and the steroid medication dexamethasone may improve survival of critically ill patients.
The situation with COVID-19, Lurie said, is very different, because testing is still critical for understanding where the coronavirus is spreading and because it’s an essential public health tool for controlling the virus.
“Testing triggers isolation and contact tracing,” Lurie said of the COVID-19 situation. “So for disease control, it’s really important to test. That was not the case with flu.”
Critically, too, is the fact that pandemic H1N1 influenza wasn’t nearly as dangerous as COVID-19. While there is still debate about exactly how deadly the novel coronavirus is, most experts peg the infection fatality rate at around 0.6% to 1%. 
According to CDC estimates, the H1N1 pandemic infected 60.8 million Americans over a year, but led to just 12,469 deaths. That puts the infection fatality rate at 0.02%, or some 30 to 50 times less deadly than COVID-19.
“The mortality rate of H1N1 pandemic virus was lower than seasonal influenza,” Adalja said. “We found that out very quickly, and that also influenced how we dealt with it.”
As of July 16, there have been nearly 3.5 million COVID-19 cases and more than 137,000 deaths in the U.S., per the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker — although both numbers are likely underestimates.
Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives and head of the CDC during the H1N1 pandemic, also noted these differences in a statement given to FactCheck.org.
“Testing data are only as useful as the actions they inform — and in the case of the 2009 H1N1 and current COVID-19 pandemics, they have very different roles,” he said. 
Because the 2009 H1N1 strain was not more dangerous than a typical seasonal influenza, which has led to between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths annually since 2010, most people did not seek care or get diagnosed. As a result, he said, for every laboratory confirmed case from April to October 2009, there were around 79 cases that went undiagnosed.
“So it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine,” Frieden said, adding that by July, collecting national data was no longer important because the data “were not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.”
COVID-19, on the other hand, is “qualitatively different,” he said, since it does lead to severe disease in many cases. “Although not everyone who contracts the virus seeks and receives testing, a higher share do, so testing data is a more useful indicator of the direction of the epidemic,” Frieden said.
“When someone compares these two pandemics and says – correctly – that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was ‘a much lesser problem than the problem that we have,’ they are inadvertently explaining exactly why reporting of testing data is so much important now than it was then,” he said. “The current pandemic is much more severe, which is why we have used public health and social measures to box in the virus, and testing is a key component of that.”
Adalja said he thought the CDC’s decision to stop individual reporting for H1N1 was reasonable. “We didn’t have molecular diagnostic testing as widespread in 2009 as it was in 2020, and the rapid tests just weren’t accurate enough,” he said, “so we knew we were undercounting.”
Lurie said anyone who makes the H1N1 comparison to the coronavirus doesn’t understand very much about COVID-19. “It’s kind of like comparing oranges and basketballs,” she said. “They’re both orange, but that’s about as far as you get.”

253,False Claim of Congressional Pay Raises in Stimulus Bill,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/false-claim-of-congressional-pay-raises-in-stimulus-bill/,,"Quick Take
Facebook posts falsely claim that House Democrats included $25 million to boost their own salaries in their proposal for the coronavirus-related stimulus package. That funding is not for legislators’ pay increases; it’s also in the bill being advanced by the Republican-controlled Senate.


Full Story 
Members of Congress are working toward passing a bipartisan, nearly $2 trillion stimulus package to bolster the economy in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. It would include direct payments to Americans, loans for small businesses, support for hospitals and more.
But online, some on social media are using various memes and posts to spread a falsehood that House Democrats are also trying to slip in $25 million to increase their own pay.
That’s wrong.
 
A number of the posts specifically refer to a $25 million funding allocation for the House referenced in a version of the package proposed by House Democrats on March 23.
That House proposal included $25 million for “Salaries and Expenses” for the chamber — which would be “allocated in accordance with a spend plan submitted to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives by the Chief Administrative Officer and approved by such Committee.”
But the bill never said it was for legislators’ salaries. Nor does the version of the stimulus package being worked out in the Republican-controlled Senate — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act — which similarly outlines $25 million for the House.
A spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee called the pay-raise claims circulating online “absurd and inaccurate.”
“The funding is to support the House’s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network,” Evan Hollander told us in an email. “It will also provide for reimbursement costs for the staff of the House Child Care Center and covers the costs of the House food service contracts. In addition, it will support the Sergeant-At-Arms on continuity of operations matters.”
He added: “Moreover, Member salaries are funded through the Treasury pursuant to the Constitution and are not funded through appropriations.”
Also, as we said, the $25 million funding for the House is included in the Senate version of the package, according to draft legislation posted March 25 by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The measure — which includes $93 million for the legislative branch collectively, including $10 million for the Republican-controlled Senate — has been agreed to in principle by congressional leaders and the White House.
A document posted by the Senate Appropriations Committee breaking down emergency appropriations in the package describes the $25 million allocated for the House in the same way Hollander does.
It’s important to note, as we’ve explained before, that the 1989 Ethics Reform Act established an automatic adjustment formula to decide annual changes to lawmakers’ salaries.
That automatic adjustment formula is “based on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the Employment Cost Index,” according to the Congressional Research Service. The percentage increase cannot surpass that for federal employees who fall under the “General Schedule” classification. It automatically goes into effect unless Congress statutorily denies it, which it has done every year since 2009.
Democrats had considered in mid-2019 ending that decade-long hiatus and allowing the automatic pay increase to go through, but backed away from the idea following a backlash from within the party.
Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27. Adults with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will receive $1,200 (married couples with an adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less will receive $2,400, plus $500 per child). The payment amount will scale down by income, phasing out at $99,000 for single individuals and $198,000 for couples without children.

254,Vaccine Ingredient SM-102 Is Safe,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/scicheck-vaccine-ingredient-sm-102-is-safe/,,"The COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna uses an ingredient called SM-102 to deliver the mRNA that carries instructions for how to develop antibodies against the novel coronavirus. A widely shared video is now spreading the falsehood that SM-102 is harmful, but the warning label it shows is for chloroform, not SM-102.

The COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna — which has been administered more than 121 million times since the Food and Drug Administration granted it an emergency use authorization in December — includes 10 ingredients.
A widely circulating claim has seized on one of those ingredients to mislead people into believing that the vaccine is unsafe.
Moderna’s vaccine underwent clinical trials — with about 30,000 volunteers in its third phase — that were overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring board. The results were reviewed not only by the FDA, but also by an outside panel of experts advising the agency, as we’ve explained. Another independent group, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also reviewed the data and recommended use of the vaccine.
Despite that, a video posted to TikTok on May 14 is spreading the false claim that SM-102, an ingredient in Moderna’s vaccine, is harmful. That video has amassed more than a million views and migrated to Instagram, where it has racked up even more views.
Misinformation peddlers with large followings — including Alex Jones and Mike Adams — have also picked up the claim and boosted its visibility.
They’ve added a veneer of government secrecy, too. Both Jones and Adams falsely claimed that the state of Connecticut revealed previously withheld information that the vaccine contains a “deadly” ingredient. But what they point to is a state Department of Health fact sheet on vaccine ingredients – which have been publicly available since the Moderna vaccine was granted an EUA in December. There has been no recent revelation about a secret ingredient.
The viral TikTok video doesn’t use the Connecticut example; it just shows the website for a health care network in New Jersey that posted an article about the vaccine ingredients in January.
All of the videos and posts focus on the same ingredient, though — SM-102, which is a lipid, a fatty molecule that doesn’t dissolve in water. We’ll explain more about it below.
The only evidence offered to support the false claim that SM-102 is dangerous is a misrepresentation of the website for a company called Cayman Chemical, which sells scientific research materials.
Cayman Chemical offers a version of SM-102 for research purposes that is packaged in chloroform, a potentially toxic chemical. So the safety data sheet from Cayman Chemical for that product includes warnings related to chloroform — not SM-102.
But both Jones and the viral TikTok video present that sheet as though the warnings are related to SM-102.
Jones, for example, said in his video, “Let’s go ahead and read over what this thing does.” He then flashed the safety data sheet across the screen and read: “Suspected of causing cancer; suspected of damaging fertility and the unborn child; causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver, and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.”
He concludes, “They want you to take two shots of this and then recurring booster shots.”
But, as we said, those warnings are for chloroform — the same list of hazards is included on the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s entry for that chemical.
The center lists no hazards for SM-102.
Chloroform is not an ingredient in Moderna’s vaccine.
Cayman Chemical explained in a press release that the product featured in these videos and posts is from its division that makes compounds for research use only. The company has a separate division that makes active pharmaceutical ingredients for human and veterinary use, which have to comply with strict guidelines from the FDA.
The safety data sheet shown in the videos “accurately represents that the mixture of chemicals in the product are 90% chloroform (a common solvent) and 10% SM-102. While it is a common solvent, chloroform has several known serious hazards, which have been included on Cayman’s [safety data sheet],” the press release said.
“Neither the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS), or the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) Classification and Labelling Inventory list any hazards associated with SM-102,” the release also said.
SM-102 is a type of lipid, Dr. Lee Riley, chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, explained in a phone interview with FactCheck.org. Moderna’s vaccine uses it as a fatty bubble, a delivery vehicle, for messenger RNA, which gives instructions to cells on how to make antibodies for the virus that causes COVID-19.
“RNA on its own (naked RNA) is highly prone to being chewed up and falling apart,” Joshua Andersen, associate professor of biochemistry at Brigham Young University, said in an email to FactCheck.org. “The only way these RNA vaccines ever stood a chance is if the RNA could somehow be stabilized. So these lipids serve as a carrier and stabilizer of the RNA in the vaccine.”
“Imagine a small bubble (made of lipids) containing the RNA that helps deliver it to our cells,” he said.
The TikTok video misleadingly highlighted part of Cayman Chemical’s safety sheet that said its version of SM-102 for research was not meant for “human or veterinary use.” But that version is not a vaccine ingredient. Andersen explained that “the ‘not for human consumption’ issue has to do with the fact that this version of SM-102 is not formulated for human consumption. This particular formulation is designated ‘research use only’ (ROU) because it’s in chloroform and it’s not purified to the standard needed for human consumption. We have super stringent standards for making something consumable, which really should be confidence inspiring to vaccine skeptics.”
So, the product used in the social media posts is not the same one that is used in the vaccine — and the warning labels they show are for a different chemical that’s not included in the vaccine.
In addition to the claim about SM-102, Jones also repeated some other claims in his video that we’ve recently debunked. We’ll list them here:

Jones claimed that nearly half of the workers at the National Institutes of Health and the CDC haven’t taken the vaccine “because they know it’s experimental, it’s not really a vaccine.” But, as we wrote, federal health officials estimated at a Senate hearing that so far about 60% of their employees have been vaccinated. They didn’t say anyone had refused to get vaccinated.
Jones showed a clip of a nurse fainting after she received the vaccine and said, “folks are getting sick, collapsing.” But as we explained before, that clip was selectively edited from a news report to show the nurse fainting. It didn’t show her quick recovery afterward, when she explained that she is prone to fainting when triggered by even a slight pain.
Jones also suggested that the vaccine is part of Bill Gates’ plan to “depopulate the earth.” In a 2010 TED Talk focused on developing new technologies to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Gates briefly mentioned reducing the rate of population growth. As we explained, a conspiratorial video misleadingly edited Gates’ talk to suggest his “wish” was to depopulate the planet through vaccines.

255,"Trump’s False Claims About Biden Wealth, Recovery Wishes",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trumps-false-claims-about-biden-wealth-recovery-wishes/,,"At a rally in North Carolina, President Donald Trump claimed Joe Biden lives in “beautiful houses all over the place” and must be “corrupt” to afford such a lifestyle. Biden owns two homes and had some lucrative years in the private sector.


Trump also falsely claimed Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Kamala Harris, didn’t send him best wishes when he was stricken with COVID-19. They did. 

Trump, Oct, 15: And then you look at the way Joe Biden lives. He lives on a politician’s salary for his whole life. 47 years, right? And he lives in these beautiful houses all over the place. I haven’t seen him, but he’s a politician and you’re not supposed to live like you’ve made $20 million a year. So he’s corrupt as hell and everyone knows it.
It is true that Biden, who has long cited his middle-class identity and his roots in working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, has had a long career in public life. The Delaware Democrat was elected to the U.S. Senate at age 29 in 1972, and served until January 2009, when he began the first of two terms as vice president. He left office in January 2017 and has found some lucrative opportunities since, as many political figures do after they leave government work.
In August 2019, Forbes estimated that Biden and his wife Jill were worth $9 million. The magazine said their wealth included two Delaware homes valued at $4 million combined, cash and investments worth around $4 million, and a federal pension worth more than $1 million.
The magazine said that when Biden stepped down as vice president, he filed a financial disclosure form listing assets and liabilities worth somewhere between negative $897,000 and positive $489,000. But over the next 23 months, according to Forbes, citing tax filings, the couple made $15 million.
Forbes said Joe Biden received $2.4 million in speaking fees and $1.8 million from book tour events. It also said he brought in $775,000 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he is the Benjamin Franklin professor of practice and where he heads the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy & Global Engagement. It said Jill Biden added $700,000 in speaking fees.
The Biden/Harris website includes links to Biden’s Office of Government Ethics forms for 2019 and 2020 and his federal income tax returns for 2016. and 2018. The Washington Post detailed Biden’s post-government income in a June 2019 story on how he “reaped millions in income since leaving the vice presidency.”
While Trump is right that Biden spent many years on a government salary, the former vice president has had some very lucrative years in the private sector. Biden doesn’t have houses “all over the place.” He has two, including a vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. And there is no evidence he earned money through any kind of corruption.
Biden and Harris Did Extend Best Wishes
At the rally, Trump also referred to the fact that the Biden campaign had announced on Oct. 15 that Harris’ communications director and a member of her flight crew had tested positive for COVID-19. Harris canceled her campaign travel through Oct. 18 as a result.
Trump, Oct. 15: But we worry about [Harris]. I’m very concerned about her, because as you probably just heard just before I walked out, two of the people that travel with her, her chief of staff and somebody else in the plane with her all the time, they have been tested positive for COVID- 19. So we extend our best wishes, right? Right? Yes? We extend our best wishes. We extend our best, which is more than they did to me. But that’s OK. That’s OK.
In fact, both Biden and Harris had made the gesture. Harris did so via Twitter on Oct. 2, the same day Trump revealed he and the first lady had tested positive, wishing the president and First Lady Melania Trump “a full and speedy recovery.”

Doug and I join Joe Biden and Dr. Biden in wishing President Trump and the First Lady a full and speedy recovery. We’re keeping them and the entire Trump family in our thoughts.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 2, 2020

Biden also tweeted on Oct. 2, wishing the first couple “a swift recovery.”

Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2020

Trump was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Oct. 2 and spent three nights there. Soon afterward he returned to the campaign trail.
On the day Trump left the hospital, Biden started a campaign speech by saying, “And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they, like so many American families, are dealing with COVID-19.”

256,Meme Distorts Facts on Annual Death Statistics,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/meme-distorts-facts-on-annual-death-statistics/,,"Quick Take
An image circulating on social media erroneously claims that the total number of deaths in the U.S. this year is significantly down compared to previous years. The meme — which implies COVID-19 restrictions weren’t needed — actually uses an incomplete figure for 2020 and makes a flawed comparison.

Full Story
A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that from late January through Oct. 3, there were an estimated 299,028 excess deaths — meaning deaths higher than what would be expected during that time period, based on previous years. Two-thirds were estimated to be directly attributed to COVID-19.
But a popular post shared on Instagram and Facebook is erroneously claiming that the total number of deaths is actually down, significantly, this year compared to years past.
“The Stats – Why We’ve All Had Our Lives Stolen From Us in 2020,” the meme is headlined. It then lists “US Deaths Per Year” from 2015 through 2019, and compares those figures to a figure for 2020 (as of Nov. 16) to suggest total deaths are actually down this year.
On Instagram, the post was shared with a caption suggesting that the media has misled on the COVID-19 pandemic.
But it’s the meme that’s misleading by using an incomplete figure for 2020 to make its claim, as well as an erroneous number for 2019.

The number of deaths cited for 2020 — 2,487,350, as of Nov. 16 — was taken that day from a table published by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.
The table, however, only accounted for deaths from Feb. 1 through Nov. 14, so it doesn’t include any deaths that occurred in January 2020 — or, of course, any that will occur in the final weeks of the year.
Also, the figures in the table are provisional — meaning some states may continue to update tallies for up to eight weeks, Bob Anderson, chief of the NCHS’ Mortality Statistics Branch, told us in a phone interview.
The public can see that in action: The same table shows that deaths for the same reporting period (of Feb. 1 through Nov. 14) has since climbed to 2,533,214 (as of Nov. 20).
And that, again, doesn’t include January — when there were an estimated 240,000 deaths, Anderson said. And again, we don’t know how many deaths will occur in the remaining weeks of 2020; Anderson noted that deaths tend to trend upward in the winter.
Yet the meme juxtaposes that incomplete 2020 figure against complete death totals for 2015 (2,712,630) through 2018 (2,839,205), which are accurate and pulled from annual “Mortality in the United States” reports published by NCHS.
Anderson said it was unclear where the meme got its 2019 figure of 2,900,689 deaths. While NCHS has not released a “Mortality in the United States” report for 2019 yet, NCHS’ provisional estimate is 2,852,308.
Whatever the 2020 figure turns out to be, the chart misleadingly downplays the risk of COVID-19 — which so far has killed nearly 1.4 million people worldwide, including more than 250,000 people in the U.S.

257,The White House Isn’t Selling Coronavirus Coins,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/the-white-house-isnt-selling-coronavirus-coins/,,"Quick Take
Headlines shared across social media caused some to wrongly believe the White House is selling coins commemorating the COVID-19 pandemic. The coin referenced is being sold by the White House Gift Shop, which is a private company based in Pennsylvania.


Update, Oct. 5: In early October, after Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19, the White House Gift Shop began selling a coin titled, “President Donald J. Trump Defeats COVID.” Confusion over the shop’s name prompted false claims that the administration was selling the coin. 


Full Story 
The White House is not selling coins related to the novel coronavirus pandemic, as some on social media have wrongly suggested.
But a COVID-19 themed coin is being sold by the White House Gift Shop — a private business that is not part of the federal government, although its origins decades ago are tied to the White House.
The company garnered attention when it began offering the coin for $125 (though it’s currently on sale for $100) as part of its “Historic Moments in History Series.”
“WORLD vs VIRUS,” reads a mock-up with a novel coronavirus graphic. “Together We FOUGHT The UNSEEN Enemy. The back shows a White House lectern and celebrates the “COVID-19 Task Force” and includes President Donald Trump’s name, as well as those of Vice President Mike Pence and other members of the White House coronavirus task force.
The company says it will donate proceeds from the coin to COVID-19 medical research.
Headlines about the coin began circulating on social media on April 29, causing confusion by virtue of the company’s name — and prompting posts of outrage on left-leaning accounts.
On Twitter and Facebook, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ official Senate accounts suggested the coin was a product of the White House while sharing a link to a Daily Beast story (which does indicate that the company is privately run). 

“If the White House Gift Shop is going to produce $100 COVID-19 coins, Trump can sure as hell utilize the Defense Production Act to manufacture the gloves, gowns, and masks our medical workers desperately need,” the Sanders posts said.
The Occupy Democrats Facebook group also shared the Daily Beast story and misleadingly wrote, “WHAT IS WRONG WITH TRUMP? Who would want these?”
Other headlines also falsely indicated the coin was coming from the actual White House, or that Trump somehow stood to profit from it.
“Trump’s New Idea To Profit: ‘$100 COVID-19 Commemorative Coins,'” read one from dailyboulder.com. Politicalflare.com asserted: “White House Sells COVID-19 Commemorative Coins That Celebrate the ‘Genius Level Thinking’ of Trump.” (That website later updated its story and apologized.)
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records show that the White House Gift Shop and White House Gift Shop, Est. 1946 are trademarks owned by Giannini Strategic Enterprises, a limited liability corporation formed in 2010 in Lititz, Pennsylvania.
In 2018, when the company sold a coin celebrating the meeting between Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, the website Talking Points Memo published a report looking into the history of the shop. It pointed to documents filed in connection with the trademark applications showing that the company’s current CEO, Anthony Giannini, officially acquired the operation in 2013 from the now-defunct United States Secret Service Uniformed Division Benefit Fund.
An archived version of the shop’s website from May 2000 describes the fund’s origins as dating back to 1946, with the start of the White House Police Benefit Fund. That fund provided flowers for officers who “had a death in their immediate family” and offered “retiring members a departing gift from the force.” The effort expanded, however, following the 1950 killing of a White House police officer during an assassination attempt on President Harry Truman.
In the years that followed, the website’s history noted, the Uniformed Division Benefit Fund was formed and revenue was “generated through the sale of various commemorative items.” Its gift shop operated in the Old Executive Office Building, and later moved to a nearby space to make it publicly accessible. The Uniformed Division Benefit Fund filed for bankruptcy in 2013.
The gift shop now operates online and no longer has a physical space in Washington, D.C. The company today says it “continues to actively support Law Enforcement Departments or Agencies by funding special advanced firearms training and by purchasing safe and effective arms for departments often in smaller jurisdictions with limited advanced training budgets.”
We reached out to the company but didn’t hear back. But Giannini, the CEO, also confirmed to the fact-checking website Snopes that the business “is not affiliated with The White House, nor is The White House involved in any of our decisions, products, or operations.”

258,Biden Video on Trump ‘Silencing’ Expert,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/biden-video-on-trump-silencing-expert/,,"Over the weekend, the Biden campaign posted a video that claims the Trump administration silenced Dr. Nancy Messonnier for “speaking out” about the new coronavirus at a Feb. 25 press briefing. But the campaign’s support for the claim is awfully thin.
Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, has regularly led press briefings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and she continued to do so even after the Feb. 25 briefing.
The Biden campaign video, which was posted on March 21, features Ron Klain, who served as former Vice President Joe Biden’s chief of staff and later as the Obama administration’s Ebola response coordinator.
In the video, Klain accuses the president of responding slowly to the coronavirus pandemic and failing to listen to experts. The video plays an audio clip of Messonnier speaking about the coronavirus on Feb. 25.
“It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,” Messonnier said, “and how many people in this country will have severe illness.”
Her frank assessment reportedly angered the president, according to a Washington Post story cited by the Biden campaign.
“Starting the next day,” Klain says in the video, “Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force. The president and the White House sent a clear message to scientists in the government — there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up.”
But it’s misleading to suggest that, as a result of her Feb. 25 remarks, “Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force.”
Messonnier is not a member of the task force, which was announced nearly a month earlier on Jan. 29, and she never attended a coronavirus task force press briefing after the group was formed. 
We searched C-SPAN, Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and White House websites and found that she did not attend any of the task force press briefings — either before or after her Feb. 25 remarks.
The Biden campaign provided no evidence that she did, either. Instead, it cited the fact that Messonnier had attended Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar’s Jan. 28 press briefing on COVID-19. “After this [Feb. 25] incident she appeared in no more briefings with Sec. Azar, a core member of the White House task force,” Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told us in an email.
But that Jan. 28 briefing was held one day before the task force was created.
The White House coronavirus task force, from Jan. 29 to Feb. 25, made three public appearances that we could find. Two were press briefings on Jan. 31 at the White House and Feb. 7 at HHS, and one was a briefing to the nation’s governors on Feb. 9 at the National Governors Association winter meeting.  
The CDC was represented at each of those briefings by CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who is a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Redfield also attended the task force meeting on Feb. 26 — the day after Messonnier’s remarks — so there was no change in the CDC’s representation at the White House task force press briefings.
It’s also wrong to suggest that the Trump administration silenced Messonnier to send a message to government scientists that “there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up.” 
Messonnier has regularly conducted CDC press briefings — including the Feb. 25 briefing that was cited in the Biden video — and that didn’t change in the days immediately following those remarks.
Since Feb. 25, Messonnier led CDC briefings on Feb. 28, Feb. 29, March 3 and March 9. She also has appeared in videos on the CDC’s Twitter page on March 9, March 13 and March 14. Those videos have received between approximately 126,000 to 238,000 views.
The Biden campaign also cited a New York Times story on March 8 that quoted former CDC Director Thomas Frieden as saying, “Nancy Messonnier told it like it is. And she was 100 percent right, and they silenced the messenger.” But Messonnier led the CDC press briefing the day after the Times story appeared, and she continued to provide a frank assessment of the impact of the outbreak in the U.S.
“This virus is capable of spreading easily and sustainably from person to person based on the available data,” she said in the March 9 briefing, according to a transcript that was released the next day. “The report of the World Health Organization mission to China describes the virus as being highly contagious. And there’s essentially no immunity against this virus in the population because it’s a new virus. Based on this, it’s fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States will at some point in time either this year or next be exposed to this virus and there’s a good chance many will become sick.”
This isn’t the first time that the Biden campaign has accused the Trump administration of silencing experts during the coronavirus outbreak.
Biden, who is currently the leading Democratic presidential candidate, claimed in a Feb. 28 interview with CNN that “Dr. Fauci is not allowed to speak publicly,” referring to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. As we wrote shortly after those comments, government scientists were told to clear their public appearances through the coronavirus task force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence, but Fauci had spoken about the pandemic in numerous public appearances.
In fact, Fauci usually attends the White House coronavirus task force briefings, despite frequently contradicting the president.
It’s worth noting that Fauci did not attend the March 23 briefing — a day after Science magazine published an interview with the NIAID director in which he admitted that Trump has given inaccurate information at the press briefings. “But I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Fauci said of Trump. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.”
There has been speculation that Trump is losing patience with Fauci’s candid remarks. It remains to be seen whether that is the case or not.
As for Messonnier, the Biden video misleads when it says she “no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force” after her Feb. 25 remarks, when in fact she never appeared at those briefings previously.",Eugene Kiely,2020-03-24 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"And she was 100 percent right, and they silenced the messenger.” But Messonnier led the CDC press briefing the day after the Times story appeared, and she continued to provide a frank assessment of the impact of the outbreak in the U.S.

259,Viral Image Spreads Bogus Trump Quote on COVID-19 Recovery,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/viral-image-spreads-bogus-trump-quote-on-covid-19-recovery/,,"Quick Take
A viral image on social media is spreading a fabricated quote attributed to President Donald Trump. There’s no evidence the president ever said that doctors have “never seen a body kill the Coronavirus like my body,” and that they “tested my DNA and it wasn’t DNA. It was USA.”

Full Story 
President Donald Trump has touted what he deems a quick recovery from COVID-19 days after he publicly announced that he was diagnosed with the disease.
But a viral image repeatedly shared by tens of thousands, in posts across social media platforms, falsely claims the president said: “The doctors said they’ve never seen a body kill the Coronavirus like my body.”
“They tested my DNA and it wasn’t DNA,” the bogus quote continues. “It was USA.”
There’s no evidence he ever said that.
The image was shared in a tweet Oct. 6 — which was retweeted more than 100,000 times — in which the user wrote, “this man literally just said he was built different.” It spread widely on Facebook, too — where one popular post claimed, “Trump really said” it — as well as on Instagram.
Some commenters wrote that they took the image to be an obvious joke.

The quote is formatted to appear as closed-captioning text for a video address that Trump recorded while in Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and shared in an Oct. 3 tweet.
A review of that four-minute video shows he never made the statement falsely attribute to him.
Joel Luther, an associate in research at the Duke Reporters’ Lab, found that the image was part of a set that was posted on Reddit on Oct. 6. It appeared in forums dedicated to memes and political humor.
A subsequent meme in the set fictitiously quotes Trump as saying, “They said if Joe Biden had this virus his body would’ve died several times by now.”
As we’ve previously explained, Trump did make exaggerated statements in that Oct. 3 video, including about the treatments he received for COVID-19, which he likened to “miracles.”
But he didn’t say the quote being widely shared on social media.

260,Biden’s Controversial COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Plan,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/09/scicheck-bidens-controversial-covid-19-vaccine-booster-plan/,,"Last month, the Biden administration announced a plan to begin administering third shots of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to healthy people in mid-September to shore up potentially flagging immunity to the coronavirus. 
But many scientists say that given the available evidence, which shows the two-dose vaccines still provide formidable protection against severe disease, it’s not yet clear that boosters are needed.
“What we expected from this vaccine is that we wanted it to protect against severe disease and the kind of disease that caused you to go to the hospital or ICU. That was the goal — keep people out of the hospital and keep them out of the morgue,” Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us. “There’s no evidence that there’s any fading of immunity in that regard.”
In fact, on Sept. 3, Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, a few weeks after backing the plan, told the White House that the FDA and CDC might only be able to make a determination on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for a subset of non-immunocompromised people in the next several weeks. That’s because of a lack of data on both vaccines in the larger population.
Moreover, some experts say booster shots are unlikely to alter the trajectory of the pandemic much — and that the doses would be much better spent getting people around the world immunized with first and second shots. 
“I’m truly disappointed. This decision is not justifiable at all looking at this data,” tweeted Dr. Muge Cevik, a physician and infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, who also serves as a COVID-19 advisor to the Scottish and U.K. governments. “We are going to use up millions of doses to reduce the small risk of mild infections in fully protected [people with] a tiny risk of hospitalisation, while most of the world waits for a first dose.”
The controversial announcement, made in an Aug. 18 press briefing by multiple top public health officials, proposed offering a third “booster” shot to Americans eight months after their second dose of a Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. According to the plan, this would mean those initially prioritized for the first two doses — primarily older people and health care workers — would also get first dibs on a booster.
The nation’s health agencies had already signed off on providing a third dose of the mRNA vaccines to immunocompromised people. The Food and Drug Administration authorized additional doses in that population for emergency use on Aug. 12, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the agency endorsed that view the following day. 
Those doses, which are meant to try to bump up a lackluster immune response to normal levels, are not controversial — and they aren’t typically referred to as boosters, which is a term sometimes reserved for an extra dose that is used to restore immunity after the primary series is complete. Some scientists have argued that in healthy people, third doses for COVID-19 should also not be called boosters if a three-dose course is the standard regimen. 
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could very well turn out to be three-dose shots, as multiple other immunizations involve three doses. But because that is not yet fully established — and the vaccine companies and federal agencies are also using the term — we will refer to third doses for healthy people as boosters for now.
While health officials repeatedly said that the decision to boost in healthy people would only occur pending review by FDA and ACIP, a specific date — Sept. 20 — was nevertheless set for the rollout to begin.
A statement, signed by all the leading public health officials, including Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, was released the same day explaining the plan, which did not yet include a second dose for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
“The available data make very clear that protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection begins to decrease over time following the initial doses of vaccination, and in association with the dominance of the Delta variant, we are starting to see evidence of reduced protection against mild and moderate disease,” the statement reads, referring to the coronavirus. “Based on our latest assessment, the current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout. For that reason, we conclude that a booster shot will be needed to maximize vaccine-induced protection and prolong its durability.”
Offit is critical of how the announcement circumvented the standard procedures. “It was just declared to be something that we were going to be doing,” he said. “It didn’t go through the FDA advisory committees, it didn’t go through the CDC advisory committees.”
And, he said, it was badly communicated. “It’s confusing to people. People think they’re no longer protected and they are protected,” he said. “I consider myself to be protected against severe disease, based on all the data.”
Other experts said the messaging could be problematic, especially for people already harboring mistrust of the vaccines. “For those who think [the vaccine is] either ineffective, experimental, or doesn’t work, the idea that there would already need to be a booster — that they’re kind of changing information around the vaccine — could certainly lead to an increased reticence to not get it,” Rachael Piltch-Loeb, a public health emergency researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us.
Two high-level FDA employees overseeing vaccine regulation decided to leave the agency later this fall, reportedly in part because of disagreement over the booster shot decision and the way it was handled.
Before the Sept. 3 news that the FDA and CDC may only recommend boosters in more limited circumstances, it had already been unclear how the administration would be able to stick to its Sept. 20 deadline. A Pfizer representative said in an Aug. 30 regulatory meeting that the company would have efficacy data on its booster shot by late September or early October. Pfizer began submitting data to the FDA on Aug. 16 and started its supplemental approval application on Aug. 25; Moderna began submitting data on its half-dose booster to the agency on Sept. 1. The FDA’s independent advisory committee is slated to review Pfizer’s booster application on Sept. 17.
Update, Sept. 24: The CDC issued booster shot recommendations on Sept. 24, saying that people age 65 and older, residents in long-term care facilities, and people age 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions should get a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at least six months after they completed the primary two-shot series. The agency said that two other groups – those age 18 to 49 with underlying medical conditions or 18 to 64 with increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 because of their jobs or institutional setting – “may” get a booster shot in the same time frame “based on their individual benefits and risks.” 
On Sept. 22, the FDA had amended the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine to allow for booster shots for those groups. 
In addition to real-world efficacy data, the FDA reviewed data from Pfizer/BioNTech on a subset of those participating in the original clinical trial. Pfizer/BioNTech also found that the incidence of COVID-19 among those who were fully vaccinated early in the clinical trial was higher in July and August, compared with trial participants who got their doses later. “The FDA determined that the rate of breakthrough COVID-19 reported during this time period translates to a modest decrease in the efficacy of the vaccine among those vaccinated earlier,” FDA said.
The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee had supported the amended EUA for those groups. It voted against recommending a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for everyone 16 and older in its Sept. 17 meeting. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted on Sept. 23 to recommend boosters for the first three groups in the CDC’s recommendations, but not for 18- to 64-year-olds at increased risk because of their jobs or institutional setting. The vote was 9-6 against that recommendation. In a statement, Walensky, the CDC director, said: “At CDC, we are tasked with analyzing complex, often imperfect data to make concrete recommendations that optimize health. In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good.”     

Several other countries either have plans to roll out booster shots to their populations or have begun them — most notably Israel, which is experiencing a surge of the delta variant and first promoted boosters for people 60 years of age and older, given at least five months after the second shot, before moving to individuals 12 and older on Aug. 29. But much of the rest of the globe has yet to get a first inoculation. 
“We’re planning to hand out extra life-jackets to people who already have life jackets while we’re leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Programme, in a press briefing on Aug. 18. “That’s the reality.”
The agency has called for a moratorium on boosters for people who are not immunocompromised, at least until the end of the month, to allow the most vulnerable people in all countries to be vaccinated.
Here, we’ll explain what the studies say so far and why some scientists are skeptical of the immediate need for boosters, given the strong performance of the vaccines thus far.
The Case for Boosters
In presenting their rationale for the decision on Aug. 18, health officials pointed to multiple recent studies conducted in the U.S. that have suggested a decline in the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in preventing any kind of lab-confirmed infection.
One study, published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, identified a modest decline in vaccine effectiveness against any kind of lab-confirmed infection, whether symptomatic or not — from 92% in early May to 75% in late July — in adults living in New York state, the vast majority of whom had been immunized with mRNA vaccines. 
An unpublished study of patients in the Mayo Clinic Health System compared the two mRNA vaccines and found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine began with an effectiveness of 76% against any kind of PCR-confirmed infection in January that fell to 42% in July. The drop for Moderna was smaller, from 86% to 76%.
An MMWR study of a more vulnerable population — U.S. nursing home residents — found that the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines against lab-confirmed infections fell from 75% in the pre-delta era to 53% with delta.
Walensky also presented data that was published in the MMWR the following week, which showed a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against PCR-confirmed infection in frontline workers, from 91% before the delta variant to 66% when delta predominated. Those workers were screened weekly for COVID-19 and also were tested if they had COVID-19-like symptoms.
These declines, officials said, could be due to waning immunity over time, the delta variant or some combination of the two.
Notably, however, officials said there was not much evidence that the vaccines were working less well in protecting against severe disease. The New York study, for example, found that vaccine protection against hospitalization remained at 90% or higher for each week analyzed. And another MMWR report, which drew on hospital information from 18 states, found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines stayed 84% to 86% effective in preventing hospitalization for 24 weeks.
Instead, the argument was that the reduced effectiveness against infection and milder forms of illness could be a harbinger of what might come — and that the government therefore wanted to plan for boosters to “stay ahead” of the virus. 
“Even though this new data affirms that vaccine protection remains high against the worst outcomes of COVID, we are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” explained Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also outlined the immunological basis for boosters, noting that antibody levels decline following vaccination; that higher antibody levels are associated with higher vaccine efficacy, which could be needed against delta; and that there’s evidence from both vaccine companies that booster shots can greatly increase antibody levels.
Officials mentioned data coming out of Israel to bolster their case, but did not cover it in any detail until a press briefing on Sept. 2. Israel has fully vaccinated almost 63% of its population, as of Sept. 1, and has used the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for nearly all of its citizens.
In the Sept. 2 briefing, Fauci noted the rising number of COVID-19 cases among the vaccinated in Israel and reviewed two unpublished papers, posted to preprint servers, documenting the effects of a booster dose in the country. 
One preprint, using Ministry of Health information on people over the age of 60 who either did or did not receive a third dose, found a more than 10-fold decrease in the risk of confirmed infection and severe disease in booster recipients compared with non-booster recipients, 12 or more days after boosting. 
A second preprint analyzed data from more than 150,000 people in an Israeli health care system who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first three weeks of August. It found that seven to 13 days after a booster shot, people were 46% to 68% less likely to test positive for the virus compared with those who had not received a booster; the risk reduction increased to 70% to 84% 14 to 20 days post-booster.
“There’s no doubt from the dramatic data from the Israeli study,” Fauci said, “that the boosts that are being now done there and contemplated here support, very strongly, the rationale for such an approach.”
Recently, officials have also cited internal data along with that of other countries to support their decision, such as when Walensky was asked in an Aug. 31 press conference whether she was still confident that boosters would be available by Sept. 20, given some reluctance on the issue from the CDC’s advisory committee the previous day.
“ACIP did not review international data that actually has led us to be even more concerned about increased risk of vaccine effectiveness waning against hospitalization, severe disease and death,” she said. “They will be reviewing that as well, but it is our own data as well as international data that has led us to be concerned that the waning we’re seeing for infection will soon lead to a waning that we would see for hospitalizations, severe disease and death, which is why it’s so critical now, to plan ahead, to remain ahead of the virus.”
It is unclear what internal data Walensky might have. We reached out to the agency for more details, including when that data would be made public, but did not receive a reply.
Lack of an Obvious Need to Boost Immunity
While Fauci may be convinced by the data, other scientists are not so sure. Not only is it not yet known how helpful a booster will be long-term, they say, but it’s far from clear that they are needed in the first place.
While it depends on the goal of vaccination and is ultimately a judgment call, multiple experts told us that boosters wouldn’t be warranted until the vaccines started to be less effective in preventing severe illness, which for healthy people, hasn’t happened yet.
“The best available data that we have are that these vaccines are still working really well against the current variants and this current wave,” Johns Hopkins epidemiologist David Dowdy told us.
Some people have pointed to Israeli data that might suggest a decline in vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 in older people, but no published or preprint work convincingly demonstrates this yet, Dr. Aaron Richterman, an infectious disease fellow at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, told us.
Some studies, he said — in particular a well-done unpublished study from Oxford University that involved random testing of households for SARS-CoV-2 — have observed modest decreases in vaccine protection against infection (see figure 2). But in his view, infection alone would not warrant a booster rollout.
A visually compelling example of the vaccines’ preserved effectiveness against hospitalization comes from the CDC’s COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or COVID-NET, which tracks COVID-19 hospitalizations in 14 states.
idence
The immunology data also back the notion that in healthy people, the vaccines are holding steady against severe COVID-19, if not always against infection or more mild illness.
“We see antibodies going down, but we know that these vaccines make very good T cell responses and B cell responses that very likely protect from serious disease,” E. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has been studying the immune responses of vaccinated people, told us.
High levels of so-called neutralizing antibodies are needed to prevent infection entirely, or what’s known as sterilizing immunity. But if those decline, which is normal, there are still immune cells around to ward off illness — namely, the B cells that make antibodies and the T cells that assist in that process and can also kill infected cells to limit the spread of a virus in a body.
Both cell types need time to kick into gear when a person is first infected or first vaccinated, but with a second exposure, the cells can re-engage, proliferate and more quickly mount an immune response than before — preventing a person from falling very ill.
“Severe disease occurs when the virus begins to replicate unchecked in the lungs and the immune system misfires in efforts to control it,” Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, told us. “Fortunately, the lungs are much more accessible to antibodies than is the upper respiratory tract, which is where the virus first enters. Moreover, because the virus hits the upper respiratory tract first, it buys memory B and T cells time to get going too before the lung becomes accessible to the virus. So for these reasons, protection against severe disease is expected to be maintained for far longer than protection against all infections.”
Wherry’s lab and others have shown that these long-lived and memory B and T cell responses to mRNA vaccination are durable, lasting at least six months, and likely longer.
Some unpublished work from the Wherry lab suggests that the pool of memory B cells that can recognize the virus continues to increase over time after vaccination, unlike antibodies that wane.
All of this is why immunologists suspect boosters might not be needed for a while yet.
“We could have protection against severe disease for a year, two years, three years,” said CHOP’s Offit, who nevertheless said boosters were likely eventually. “We’ll see.”
It’s also why Offit doesn’t buy the administration’s argument that fading vaccine immunity against infection or mild disease necessarily presages dwindling effectiveness against severe disease. “I think it’s built on a false premise,” he said. 
Bhattacharya similarly said that he thought it would be “years” before a booster is needed to increase protection against severe disease. But if the goal is to prevent infection, then it might take annual boosters to keep antibody levels high.
A Benefit to Boosting Now?
The experts we spoke with agreed that giving third doses of the mRNA vaccines now could very well be somewhat helpful, but likely only to a limited degree — and would not be as advantageous as immunizing unvaccinated people.
“Boosting would almost certainly raise the concentration of antibodies for a while. How much clinical benefit we would see is much harder to predict,” Bhattacharya told us in an email. “Given that most estimates place the current 2-dose regimen at ~80+% effectiveness against symptomatic infections, there is not a ton of room to improve.”
“The real question is whether booster shots enhance memory,” said Dowdy. “If so, they could boost immunity for a longer period of time. But we have no evidence one way or the other on that. And also no compelling evidence that immunity from the initial vaccine series has waned to the extent that a booster is needed.”
While on the surface the Israeli studies suggest boosters might have a large impact, those effects have so far been observed only for a short period of time, and it remains unknown how long they might last.
“It would be very surprising if a third dose of a vaccine that we already know is effective didn’t decrease risk of infection by some amount over the short-term,” Richterman said. But, he added, the extra dose “probably doesn’t decrease it to the degree that these observational studies from Israel suggest because of large differences in exposure risk / behaviors between those getting the booster and those who did not.”
Richterman was especially dubious of the booster preprint that claimed a 10-fold reduction in the risk for severe COVID-19, which he said was “essentially uninterpretable” because it had a design flaw known as immortal time bias. Because outcomes weren’t counted for the boosted group until 12 days after getting the booster, he said, that group likely had less follow-up than the unboosted group, biasing the results in favor of boosters. “It takes on average 5 days from diagnosis to develop severe infection, oftentimes much longer,” he said, “so you can imagine that the boosted group has probably in many cases not even had the chance to have this outcome.”
It should be more clear what effect boosters have once the results are in from Pfizer/BioNTech’s phase 3 randomized controlled trial, he said.
Dowdy also cautioned against relying too heavily on the Israeli experience. Noting that the population of the country is about the same as the state of Michigan — and the U.S. would be unlikely to make national policy based on one state — he said, “we should be similarly hesitant to formulate national policy on data from a country the size of Israel.”
Another potential boon of boosters is their impact on reducing transmission of the coronavirus. But many scientists are skeptical that boosters will do much to bring the pandemic to a close.
“I doubt this would have a dramatic impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,” Bhattacharya said. “We know that vaccinated breakthrough infections can transmit, but the major drivers of the pandemic are still transmission from and to the unvaccinated.”
“The problem right now is not that we need to boost people who are already vaccinated. The problem is we need to vaccinate people who aren’t vaccinated,” said Offit. “The vaccine’s working, but it doesn’t work if we don’t give it.”
Relative to vaccinating new people, booster shots would be expected to be only incrementally helpful in reducing transmission and mitigating the pandemic, Richterman said. “Keep in mind that 1% of the low-income world has been vaccinated. If we want to end the pandemic, that is where the work must be done,” he added.
For its part, the Biden administration says it can “do both” — provide boosters to Americans while also helping other countries get first and second jabs. Officials have emphasized that the U.S. is the global leader in vaccine donations and announced on Sept. 2 that the government would be investing nearly $3 billion to scale up domestic vaccine manufacturing. Critics, however, say more should be done.
Beyond the ethics of working toward vaccine equity, Dowdy said a case could be made that even from a purely self-serving perspective, the U.S. should focus on helping to administer first and second doses, rather than rolling out booster shots to its own population, as that would limit circulation of the virus overall and help prevent the emergence of more transmissible or dangerous viral variants.
To Boost or Not to Boost?
Ultimately, the decision to boost is “one that’s going to have to be made in the face of imperfect evidence,” said Dowdy. The administration is in the difficult situation of trying to balance waiting for enough evidence against the risk of a surge in cases.
“I feel like the data right now to support any decisions are pretty weak,” he said. “But that’s also the nature of this. There’s no way that we’re going to be able to make the decision with great data without seeing a spike in cases.”
Several scientists said many questions remain about the best way to do a COVID-19 booster, including the number, spacing between doses and whether it’s advantageous to boost with a variant-specific vaccine or mix and match with different vaccines.

“I think that’s going to require more complicated studies to sort out,” Wherry said of the possibility of altering the timing of the doses or using mix-and-matched shots. “And I don’t know that we’re going to get to the bottom of that in the current pandemic situation.”


As for what happens next with the administration’s booster plan, we’ll learn more in the coming weeks as the FDA and CDC make recommendations and potentially release more research.
Update, Sept. 17: The CDC corrected and republished the New York study on Sept. 17, and we have updated two of the statistics from the study accordingly. 
We also removed a section of this story, which explored the study’s original finding of no decline in vaccine effectiveness for people age 65 and older, but a decline in younger people and the population as a whole. The corrected study now shows a 10.5 percentage point decline in effectiveness, to 80%, for those age 65 and older. That’s still notably lower than the decline of 20.2 percentage points for the 18-to-49 age group. 
We also contacted Johns Hopkins epidemiologist David Dowdy, who had been quoted in that section of our story. Dowdy told us of the corrected study: “I would still say that the trend in vaccine effectiveness over time is very gradual, with the vaccines still having 75% or greater effectiveness at the end of the time period.”
Our original story also said that another CDC study found vaccine effectiveness against infections among nursing home residents had dropped to 52% in the delta era.

261,Trump Adds New Falsehood to Pelosi/Chinatown Claims,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-adds-new-falsehood-to-pelosi-chinatown-claims/,,"President Donald Trump has upped the ante in his allegations about Nancy Pelosi and Chinatown, falsely charging that the House speaker urged foreign nationals to “bring your infection” to the San Francisco neighborhood. Pelosi never issued such an invitation.
Trump made the claim in remarks at the White House May 22 at a ceremony honoring veterans, describing what he said were Pelosi’s actions a month after his administration announced travel restrictions on China on Jan. 31. The restrictions barred foreign nationals who had been in China in the past 14 days, other than the immediate families of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, from entering the country.
Trump, May 22: Nancy Pelosi, a month later, was in Chinatown in San Francisco. She’s dancing in the streets of Chinatown, trying to say, “It’s okay to come to the United States. It’s fine. It’s wonderful. Come on in. Bring your infection with you.” And then she said, “He should have done it earlier” — about me. And she’s dancing a month later. These people are sick.
As we have written, Pelosi traveled to Chinatown on Feb. 24 in an effort to bolster the neighborhood’s restaurants and shops. Their business had fallen sharply in the wake of the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year.
The visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties implemented shelter-in-place restrictions. On the day of Pelosi’s visit, Trump tweeted this about the virus: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”
While, as we have written, Trump announced the travel restrictions at the end of January, he also downplayed the danger of the virus in a series of remarks and tweets from Jan. 22 to March 10.
The Pelosi-goes-to-Chinatown riff has been a staple at Trump appearances over the past several months. As we have reported, Trump referred to the visit six times in April at White House coronavirus task force briefings, each time describing inaccurately what transpired.
Trump variously said Pelosi held a “rally” in Chinatown, was having or wanted to have “parties” or a “street party” there and encouraged people to go to a “big parade.” In fact, Pelosi never mentioned parties or rallies, and the “big parade” — the Chinese New Year Parade — took place on Feb. 8, two weeks before Pelosi went there.
In May, Trump shifted to references to Pelosi “dancing in the streets of San Francisco in Chinatown.” She didn’t.
Pelosi did walk the streets of Chinatown Feb. 24 and urged people to return to its shops and restaurants.
Pelosi, Feb. 24: [W]e should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern surrounding tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come. It’s lovely here. The food is delicious, the shops are prospering, the parade was great. Walking tours continue. Please come and visit and enjoy Chinatown.
Trump and Pelosi have long been at odds, and the president was angered by the decision of the House to impeach him. In March, a Pelosi aide said the two hadn’t spoken in five months.
As his latest comments reflect, Trump was not pleased by Pelosi’s criticism that he had responded too slowly to the coronavirus. On March 29, on CNN’s “State of the Union,” she said, “his denial at the beginning was deadly. His delaying of getting equipment to where — it continues — his delay in getting equipment to where it’s needed is deadly.”
The following day, Trump returned fire on “Fox & Friends.”
Trump, March 30: Look, she’s a sick puppy in my opinion. She really is. She got a lot of problems. And that’s a horrible thing to say, especially when I was the one — and, you know, I’ve gotten from fair people, you know, a lot of accolades, and I don’t want the accolades but it’s just in service of a fact. When I stopped some very, very infected, very, very sick people, thousands coming in from China long earlier than anybody thought, including the experts.
In his May 22 remarks, Trump repeated another claim, that he “was very early” with his travel restrictions, but that is not the case. As we have reported, 36 countries, including the U.S., had imposed travel restrictions by Feb. 2, the day the U.S. restrictions went into effect. 
The president also repeated a false claim that he “was the only — the one that wanted to do it.” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the decision came from “the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.” 
So, yes, Pelosi did go to Chinatown in February to encourage people to eat and shop in the neighborhood. But she certainly didn’t invite foreign nationals to “bring your infection” there.",Rem Rieder,2020-05-26 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"And that’s a horrible thing to say, especially when I was the one — and, you know, I’ve gotten from fair people, you know, a lot of accolades, and I don’t want the accolades but it’s just in service of a fact.

262,No Evidence to Back COVID-19 Ibuprofen Concerns,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/no-evidence-to-back-covid-19-ibuprofen-concerns/,,"Q: Does ibuprofen make COVID-19 worse?


A: There is no evidence that ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can make COVID-19 cases more severe. You should consult your doctor before changing medications.

FULL QUESTION
Is it true that using ibuprofen has been shown to worsen symptoms of Coronavirus?
I’m getting warning that Advil makes coronavirus condition worse in affected patients. Patients should only take Tylenol. Is there any evidence this is true?
Is it unsafe to use ibuprofen in the current outbreak of Covid-19 virus? Some state that it magnifies the symptoms of the virus by 10-fold?!
FULL ANSWER
Many readers have written in to ask whether ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, can worsen COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Other NSAIDs include over-the-counter painkillers such as naproxen (Aleve) as well as prescription-only pills such as celecoxib (Celebrex), which is used to treat arthritis.
The idea has been circulating on social media and also has been promoted to some degree by a few national governments. While there are some good reasons for certain patients to avoid NSAIDs generally, there is no evidence that ibuprofen — which is sold under the brand name Advil — or other similar drugs exacerbate the disease. Instead, the notion is simply a hypothesis that has not been tested.
Much of the hubbub over ibuprofen appears to have started with comments from the French health minister, Olivier Véran, who said in a March 14 tweet that taking anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen “could be a factor in worsening the infection.” He advised people with fevers to take paracetamol, the European name for acetaminophen, or Tylenol, instead. He also suggested that people already taking anti-inflammatories should consult with their physicians.
A few days earlier, a letter published in the British medical journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine hypothesized that ibuprofen could make it easier for the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to enter cells. As we’ll explain, that’s possible, but there is no evidence yet to suggest that’s the case. There could also be positive effects of NSAIDs on the virus.
Soon after, inaccurate messages sounding the alarm about ibuprofen flooded social media networks and messaging apps. One of the viral warnings many of our readers asked about claims a lab in Vienna found that the “vast majority” of people who died from COVID-19 had taken ibuprofen and that a nurse at Vancouver General Hospital said, “Advil makes the virus 10x worse” and “kickstarts the virus into pneumonia.”
The message appears to be a modified version of a fake WhatsApp phone message circulating in Germany that also cited an institution in Vienna. The Medical University of Vienna called the messages “fake news” and told Politico that it had neither discussed the issue internally nor done any research on ibuprofen and COVID-19.
The name-checked Vancouver hospital has also been similarly targeted, with someone circulating a fake memo about ibuprofen and COVID-19 bearing the hospital system’s logo. The hospital system explains on its website that the memo “was not an authentic memo,” and told us in an email that they “did not issue” the message our readers asked about.  
After an initial news report that a World Health Organization spokesman endorsed the recommendation to avoid ibuprofen, the WHO clarified that it did not advise “against the use of ibuprofen.” 
The group said in a tweet that in its consultations with physicians treating COVID-19 patients, it has not heard of any negative effects of ibuprofen beyond its known side effects, and that it “is not aware of published clinical or population-based data on this topic.”

Q: Could #ibuprofen worsen disease for people with #COVID19?

Other medical groups and health agencies also chimed in, iterating that there isn’t evidence linking worse COVID-19 symptoms to ibuprofen.
For example, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, said in a statement that more research is needed, but there currently is “no evidence that ibuprofen increases the risk of serious complications or of acquiring the virus that causes COVID-19.”
Still, some governments are advising against ibuprofen for COVID-19 patients or recommending other medicines. England’s National Health Service, for instance, acknowledges that there is “currently no strong evidence” that ibuprofen can worsen COVID-19 symptoms, but recommends acetaminophen for people treating COVID-19 “until we have more information.”
So how legitimate is the concern? Experts told us that it’s possible ibuprofen could have a negative effect on COVID-19 patients, but it’s purely hypothetical at this point.
Potential Mechanisms
To begin to think about whether NSAIDs are a good idea or not for COVID-19 patients, it’s useful to review their chemistry and what they do in the body. 
The drugs relieve pain and reduce fevers by blocking an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase, which prevents the formation of molecules called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins have a variety of effects, but generally promote inflammation, which is part of the body’s immune response.
In news articles, some scientists and physicians have proposed that ibuprofen or other NSAIDs could dampen the immune response to COVID-19 or otherwise make the infection worse, as some have contended is true for other respiratory infections. But as the NIAID has said, there is “no conclusive evidence that taking ibuprofen is harmful for other respiratory infections.”
And scientists who study these mechanisms say it’s not necessarily the case that NSAIDs would tamp down the immune system and hamper the body’s efforts to eliminate a pathogen. That’s because while prostaglandins are thought of as pro-inflammatory, some can have the opposite effect. And it’s not always clear whether a more or less active immune response is better. While a patient wants a robust enough response to clear the virus, too strong of a response can be deadly.
“The prostaglandins suppressed by NSAIDs can be harmful or beneficial in an inflammatory reaction like the one that proves fatal in COVID-19,” University of Pennsylvania prostaglandin researcher Garret FitzGerald told us.
In a letter published in the journal Science, FitzGerald called the French minister’s advice on ibuprofen “misguided,” and he outlined examples from the literature that demonstrate a number of different possibilities. 
In one instance, mice infected with a different coronavirus were more likely to die when a particular prostaglandin was reduced because the molecule played an important role in limiting an overactive immune response.
But on the flip side, one prostaglandin can inhibit replication of the SARS virus, which is highly similar to the coronavirus behind the current pandemic. And researchers have previously found that the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin can actually prevent the SARS virus from assembling its RNA genome.
There’s also some evidence that the SARS virus boosts prostaglandin production.
“Based on these findings, if we see a clinical signal, we can rationalize it,” FitzGerald wrote, “but therein lies the challenge. Many clinical anecdotes remain stalled in biological plausibility.”
In an email, FitzGerald cautioned that all of these pieces of evidence are from in vitro experiments in cells or in animal models with related, but distinct viruses. “So the message is that we need to do the basic research with COVID-19 itself and carefully model different stages of the human disease to see if there might be a place for NSAIDs or that they make things worse,” he said. “We are a long way off a public health advisory either way.”
He also found the recommendation for acetaminophen to be curious, since it also acts on cyclooxygenase to inhibit prostaglandin formation, albeit to a lesser extent than standard NSAIDs. So if there is a problem with the drugs and COVID-19, that doesn’t necessarily mean acetaminophen is a good choice.
Other scientists agree that it’s plausible that ibuprofen could affect COVID-19 patients, but that it’s simply impossible to say without more research.
“You could imagine that by using NSAIDs that you do change the balance of these prostaglandins and other small lipid mediators, and that that changes your immune response,” said University of Iowa coronavirus researcher Stanley Perlman. 
“That being said,” Perlman added, “there’s not lots of data showing that you make an interpretable difference in these levels, and then how that affects outcomes. So right now, it’s really more speculative than anything else.”
The other main hypothesis for why ibuprofen might be especially dangerous for COVID-19 patients comes from a March 11 correspondence letter in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. 
Much of the article, which was not peer-reviewed, discusses potential reasons why people with high blood pressure or diabetes appear to be more susceptible to COVID-19. The basic claim, which the authors later emphasized was only a hypothesis, is that these patients could be at higher risk because of the medications they take to manage these conditions. 
Drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers, they said, raise the levels of a protein called ACE2, which happens to be the protein the novel coronavirus uses to enter human cells. As a result, the authors argued, the drugs might “facilitate infection” and increase “the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.”
Ibuprofen is not one of these drugs, but got a nod in a single, unsourced sentence that claimed that it, too, can increase ACE2 levels.
That fundamental claim, however, appears to have little to back it. Rachel Graham, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, told NPR that there’s virtually no evidence that ibuprofen raises ACE2 levels.
Indeed, we could find very little in the literature to support the idea — just one study suggesting ibuprofen could increase ACE expression in diabetic rats, and nothing about an impact in humans.
Even if it is the case that ibuprofen raises ACE2 levels in humans, that doesn’t necessarily mean taking the drug would make people more likely to catch the virus.
“Virus entry into cells is a funny business because viruses need very, very little receptor on the surface of a cell to enter it,” said Perlman. “So if you went from having zero to some, that would make it susceptible, but some to more may not do very much.” 
Studies have shown that ACE2 is present in a variety of human cell types, including the epithelial cells that line the lung.
There is also some research to suggest that ACE2 may actually have a protective function — so it’s not a given that more ACE2 would be a bad thing for a COVID-19 patient. Although limited to a specific set of circumstances, one study found that ACE2 protects mice against lung failure.
“If there are effects on ACE2, ACE2 has both positives and negative effects in the infection by itself,” said Perlman. “So we just don’t know where it’s all going to come out.”
So, there are some possible ways ibuprofen or other NSAIDs might negatively impact COVID-19, but the biological plausibilities can also be spun in the other direction — and there’s certainly no evidence that ibuprofen makes the disease 10 times worse, as some of the viral messages claim. 
There are nevertheless valid reasons for COVID-19 patients to avoid NSAIDs, if only because of their previously known drawbacks. NSAIDs have gastrointestinal, kidney and cardiovascular side effects, which may be especially dangerous in very ill or elderly patients or in those with preexisting conditions. 
Stanford University pulmonologist Angela Rogers told NPR that most patients in the hospital for an infection would receive acetaminophen rather than NSAIDs, since those patients are at a higher risk of organ damage.
Given the side effects, Perlman said that not using NSAIDs is “probably a good thing” generally. But, he added, “that has nothing to do with COVID-19. That’s just the way NSAIDs work.”
For his part, FitzGerald does not recommend NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients, but doesn’t think patients in chronic pain, for example, should stop taking their NSAIDs and switch to opioids.
Indeed, without more evidence, no one can come to a firm conclusion about the effects of these drugs on COVID-19. In the meantime, patients should not change their medications without speaking with a physician.",Jessica McDonald,2020-03-30 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"As a result, the authors argued, the drugs might “facilitate infection” and increase “the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.”
Ibuprofen is not one of these drugs, but got a nod in a single, unsourced sentence that claimed that it, too, can increase ACE2 levels. For example, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, said in a statement that more research is needed, but there currently is “no evidence that ibuprofen increases the risk of serious complications or of acquiring the virus that causes COVID-19.”
Still, some governments are advising against ibuprofen for COVID-19 patients or recommending other medicines. Much of the hubbub over ibuprofen appears to have started with comments from the French health minister, Olivier Véran, who said in a March 14 tweet that taking anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen “could be a factor in worsening the infection.” He advised people with fevers to take paracetamol, the European name for acetaminophen, or Tylenol, instead. Drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers, they said, raise the levels of a protein called ACE2, which happens to be the protein the novel coronavirus uses to enter human cells. “So we just don’t know where it’s all going to come out.”

263,Trump’s Misplaced Blame on Obama for Coronavirus Tests,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/trumps-misplaced-blame-on-obama-for-coronavirus-tests/,,"77.5KAmid criticism over his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he had to overcome an Obama-era Food and Drug Administration “rule” to more quickly provide diagnostic tests to the American people. Experts, however, told us no such formal regulation was ever implemented under the previous administration.
The outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, has now spread to more than 70 countries, including the U.S. According to a Johns Hopkins University case tracker and a New York Times database, as of March 6, more than 200 people in the U.S. have been infected with the new disease, known as COVID-19, and at least 14 have died.
The Trump administration has been criticized for its handling of the outbreak, especially the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s belated rollout of testing kits. (We’ll explain more of what happened in an upcoming article.) 
But in a March 4 briefing with airline executives at the White House, Trump and other coronavirus task force officials attempted to deflect criticism, suggesting that the lack of available testing was partly President Barack Obama’s fault.
Trump, March 4: I just want to add, if I might — and to go a little bit further — the Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. That was a decision we disagreed with. I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we’ve undone that decision.
Later, CDC Director Robert Redfield followed up, describing the regulatory change as one related to “laboratory developed tests,” or diagnostic tests that are designed, manufactured and performed in the same place, such as in a hospital or academic institution. These tests are different from the ones that the CDC developed and has sent to public health labs across the country.
Redfield, March 4: [I]n the past, we used to be able to have laboratories that could develop what we call “laboratory developed tests” and then be able to apply them for clinical purposes. And in the previous administration, that became regulated so that, now, for someone to do that, they had to formally file with the FDA. And what the president’s decision did was allow that regulatory relief now and that those university labs and those other labs in this country now can be fully engaged in developing laboratory diagnostics for the clinical arena so the men and women in this nation can get access to — and the doctors — to get to know the extent of [the virus] in the patients that they’re caring for. It’s, really, very important. It’s what’s changed the availability of testing overnight.
After Redfield’s explanation, Trump then referred to the “Obama rule” again, saying, “we ended that rule very quickly.”
When asked in a March 5 Fox News town hall whether he blamed Obama, Trump insisted that he didn’t, before claiming again that his administration inherited “some decisions which were not good decisions” and that he “undid some of the regulations.”
It’s not clear what regulation Trump and Redfield have in mind, and neither the White House, FDA, nor the CDC responded to requests for more information. But experts told us that no such “rule” was implemented under Obama.
“It’s not true,” said Rachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor, of Trump’s claim in a phone interview. The Obama administration did attempt to impose a risk-based system of regulation on laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, and introduced draft guidance in 2014. But that guidance was never finalized, and was withdrawn after Trump won the election in 2016. “It never went into effect,” she said, “so it’s not an issue to walk back.”
Citing the withdrawn guidance document, Jeffrey Gibbs of the firm Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, who is an expert on FDA law, also told us that the president’s claim was “not accurate.”
Erika Lietzan of the University of Missouri School of Law said it was possible Trump and Redfield were thinking of a de facto FDA policy that applies to lab developed tests in emergency situations, such as an outbreak, in which an emergency use authorization, or EUA, is involved.
To Lietzan, that appears to be most relevant to the new policy the Trump FDA announced on Feb. 29, and which administration officials trumpeted in the briefing. The new policy states that because of the current coronavirus outbreak, the FDA would allow labs to create and use their own in-house tests immediately, without FDA review, as long as they completed an EUA request within 15 days.
But in this case as well, there is no formal document that Trump needed to rescind to allow labs to create their own coronavirus tests.
It’s worth explaining that lab developed tests are a bit different than other diagnostics in terms of agency oversight. As Lietzan has explained in a blog post, most other diagnostic tests require FDA clearance before they can be used. In an emergency situation, however, the agency can issue an EUA to forgo that clearance. That’s what was done for CDC’s coronavirus test, which is the test that has been used in the majority of diagnoses so far.
The CDC’s diagnostic test was sent out to a network of public health labs on Feb. 5 so that states and cities could do testing. But because of a faulty ingredient in the kits, some labs could not perform the tests, and testing was delayed. Allowing health departments, medical facilities and diagnostic companies to create their own diagnostic tests to screen specimens on site or through the mail could increase the capacity and speed of testing.
The FDA generally does not require clearance for lab developed tests, which are created and run in the same location, but does request that labs get agency authorization in the form of an EUA in an emergency situation.
Former Trump FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb explained in a Twitter thread the rationale, noting that in such an emergency, the government wants to be sure that the diagnostic works. “Precision matters,” he wrote. “False negative results can have significant adverse consequences.”
The policy of asking LDT makers to get an EUA in an emergency, however, is not written into law, and has simply been FDA practice. As Lietzan told us in an email, “this is a ‘request’ from FDA — not a requirement in the formal legal sense.” In fact, she said there is an entire legal debate over whether the FDA can regulate lab developed tests at all.
Again, Trump didn’t need to rescind any rule to legally allow the lab developed tests. It’s not clear whether the de facto policy originated under Obama. Lietzan said she did not know, and neither did Gibbs.
Lietzan said because the FDA website does ask labs to submit their tests for review, the Trump administration may have wanted to create the new policy to reassure test makers that they had a green light. In that way, she thought Trump’s and Redfield’s claims might have a “kernel of truth while being misleadingly imprecise and somewhat exaggerated.”
As was pointed out in the Fox News town hall, even if Trump thought there was a bad LDT regulation, he could have changed it at any point in his presidency, or earlier in the outbreak. When asked about that, Trump said he was preoccupied with other things, “like trade and millions of other things,” and claimed his administration took action on testing kits “as soon as we found out.”
In any case, Trump is wrong to claim that he “ended” any “rule.” The larger legal debate aside, the policy — if that is indeed what he was referencing — has not been undone; it is only for coronavirus LDTs that the FDA has clarified there’s a carve out. 
And Gibbs said that the agency always had the option of issuing an EUA to a test maker anyway. Obama, he said, gave LDTs emergency use authorizations during the Zika outbreak. The Trump administration “may well deserve credit for acting more rapidly,” he said, but the idea that a lab could not get an EUA, he said, “is incorrect.”
Gottlieb noted this in his Twitter thread. Asking labs to inform the FDA and get an EUA, he wrote, “doesn’t mean we can’t have labs offer tests to diagnose COVID-19.  FDA can grant an EUA to a laboratory to run a coronavirus test at a single site, or can authorize a common protocol for multiple laboratories to collaborate.”
Gibbs was puzzled by the administration’s stance. “I still do not know what LDT-related policy Trump believes has been altered,” he said.
Based on Redfield’s description, Sachs, the Washington University in St. Louis law professor — who has written about LDTs for years — said that the CDC director appeared to be talking about the Obama administration’s 2014 draft guidance. “Because that never went into effect, there was nothing for the FDA to roll back this past weekend,” she said. 
And even if he’s referring to the wonky situation with LDTs with an EUA — which may or may not have been changed under Obama — she said, “there’s certainly not an affirmative guidance document or other regulatory action that we can point to from that administration that needed to be walked back.” She said the statement was false.",Jessica McDonald,2020-03-06 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"“It never went into effect,” she said, “so it’s not an issue to walk back.”

264,Research Rebuts Claims Linking COVID-19 Vaccines to Male Infertility,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/06/scicheck-research-rebuts-baseless-claims-linking-covid-19-vaccines-to-male-infertility/,,"
Early in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., we addressed questions and claims about the impact of vaccination on fertility. Some claims used a bogus argument to conclude that the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — would cause “female sterilization.” In reality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that there is no evidence any vaccine, including those for COVID-19, cause fertility problems.
More recently, some posts swirling on social media have spread an unfounded narrative that the vaccines will create widespread infertility problems for men.

A May 23 story published on a website called the Daily Expose, based in the U.K., and shared on Facebook more than 1,100 times, claims that the “VACCINES could cause ‘mass male infertility.'”
The story cites an interview with Roger Hodkinson — a Canadian pathologist who in 2020 reportedly called COVID-19 “the biggest hoax,” erroneously likening the disease to the flu. It claims that “the spike protein expresses in the placenta and the testes,” which “could kill unborn babies in current pregnancies and permanently stop men having children.” The Daily Expose story also takes aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggesting the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a “dead man walking.”
The claims have been republished on other websites and spread elsewhere, including on Twitter and Instagram — where one popular post declared that “all males who have been vaccinated are effectively sterile.”
But experts say there is no evidence that the vaccines cause infertility in men. And there are new data that further undercut the online claims.
In a study published June 17 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers at the University of Miami reported that they found “no significant decreases in any sperm parameter” among a group of healthy men before and after receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine. The team collected semen samples of 45 men, 18 and older, before receiving either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine — and again more than 70 days after receiving their second dose.
“This is the full life cycle of sperm and 70 days is sufficient time to see if the vaccine impacts semen parameters,” Daniel C. Gonzalez, a medical student at the university and one of the study’s authors, said in a statement. “We measured semen volume, sperm concentration, and the total amount of moving sperm and found there were no declines in any of the parameters as compared to the baseline analysis.”
Researchers at a hospital in Israel have reported similar findings in a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed. That study evaluated the sperm production in 43 men before and after receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. “Our results demonstrate that the vaccine does not impair sperm parameters,” the authors wrote.


Dr. Puneet Masson, director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Penn Medicine, also told us in a phone interview that his observations in the field rebut the notion that vaccines are detrimental to male fertility.
“I’ve had patients who had fertility testing pre-vaccine and post-vaccine, just by virtue of my practice, and I have not had any patients I can think of who have had any adverse reactions from the vaccines in terms of fertility,” he said.
The Society for Male Reproduction and Urology and the Society for the Study of Male Reproduction issued a joint statement in January saying that “COVID-19 vaccines should be offered to men desiring fertility, similar to men not desiring fertility, when they meet criteria for vaccination.”
The statement notes that some men could experience a fever following vaccination, which “can cause temporary declines in sperm production.”
“Thus, if a man experiences fever as the result of the COVID-19 vaccine, he may experience a temporary decline in sperm production, but that would be similar to or less than if the individual experienced fever from developing COVID-19 or for other reasons,” the statement said.
Masson said that “someone getting a mild fever from a vaccine is still better” than getting COVID-19, especially since a fever from the disease may last longer.
Experts say a fever could affect a man’s fertility for upward of three months. But again, that’s any fever — not something unique to a fever following vaccination.
Hodkinson — the Canadian pathologist cited in the Daily Expose story alleging the potential for “mass male infertility” — made similar suggestions in a May video interview. He claimed that the ACE2 receptor “is present in the testes” and “it’s actually on the cells that produce spermatozoa.” On the screen of the video, the headline of a paper reads: “ACE2 receptor expression in testes: implications in coronavirus disease 2019 pathogenesis.”
That paper was published in 2020 in the journal Biology of Reproduction. The study dealt with the COVID-19 disease, not the vaccines.
Two of the study’s authors told us in an email that there was “[a]bsolutely not” anything in their paper that suggests the vaccines could cause issues with the testes or male fertility.
The paper “is a hypothetical article about the potential effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproductive health, not about the impact of COVID-19 vaccine on male reproductive health,” said Saguna Verma, a professor and immunologist at the University of Hawaii, and Dr. Hooman Sadri, an assistant professor and reproductive biologist at Wake Forest University.
“We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 could infect testes cells and lead to testosterone reduction or germ cell depletion for short-term period. This hypothesis was based on the clinical reports of reduced testosterone levels in COVID-19 patients,” they said. They noted that “these effects were transient in patients,” so their paper did not prove that infection with the virus leads to male infertility, either.
On that point, the University of Miami research team that studied male fertility and the COVID-19 vaccines has previously reported evidence that three men who died from COVID-19 had impaired sperm function — and that the virus was present in the testes of one man — prompting questions about whether the virus itself could potentially affect male fertility. The study’s lead author, Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy, suggested further studies on the issue are in order.

We have corrected the story.",Angelo Fichera,2021-06-17 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"It claims that “the spike protein expresses in the placenta and the testes,” which “could kill unborn babies in current pregnancies and permanently stop men having children.” The Daily Expose story also takes aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggesting the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a “dead man walking.”

265,"Misinformation, Speculation Follow Trump COVID-19 Diagnosis",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/misinformation-speculation-follow-trump-covid-19-diagnosis/,,"The news that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump contracted the novel coronavirus led to a wave of social media posts spreading misinformation — and politically charged speculation.
Some of posts tapped into baseless conspiracy theories, and others shared outright falsehoods, as we’ll explain.
First, here’s some of what we know about the matter:

Trump announced early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus, which causes COVID-19. “Tonight, @FLOTUS  and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” he wrote shortly before 1 a.m.
That announcement followed breaking news by Bloomberg News that a Trump aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the virus. Hicks had been traveling with Trump in recent days.
The White House later released a memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, Trump’s White House physician, dated Oct. 1, which in part said: “This evening I received confirmation that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing “mild symptoms.”
A subsequent memo from Conley specified that Trump had “PCR-confirmation” — a reference to a standard testing method — and said Trump received a “single 8 gram dose of Regeneron’s polyclonal antibody cocktail” and other medicine. The “President remains fatigued but in good spirits,” Conley said, adding that Melania Trump “remains well with only a mild cough and headache.”
Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Speculation, Conspiracy Theories Floated
In the hours immediately following Trump’s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Others shared conspiracy theories.
Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that “the left” may have deliberately spread the virus to him.
Neither notion is supported by available evidence.
One popular Facebook post cast doubt on the diagnosis by saying that Trump “needed a ‘reset'” for his campaign and therefore the diagnosis may be a “con.”
Another widely shared post raised the suspicion that the diagnosis may be a bid at “free publicity” and a move to get out of the next debate with his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
Asked on Fox News what would happen in terms of the Oct. 15 presidential debate — which falls within the 14-day quarantine window — White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, “We haven’t gotten that far just yet.”
On Twitter, DeAnna Lorraine — a far-right candidate who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory and launched a failed bid for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s seat — speculated on Twitter that Trump may have been intentionally infected during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29.
Lorraine offered no evidence to support her speculation in her original tweet, which said: “Trump was fine until the debate, where they set up microphones & podiums for him. Incubation period is usually 2-3 days. He tests positive a couple of days after the debate. I put nothing past the left. NOTHING.” She didn’t respond to our request for information.
But the tweet was shared more than 6,000 times within hours of being posted. Lorraine herself later responded to another Twitter user, saying, “Impossible to prove, but something that needs to be in the discussion.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 spreads mostly through respiratory droplets — created when people sneeze, cough or talk. That’s why public health officials recommend wearing masks.
“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,” according to the CDC. “This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads.”
During the debate, though, not everyone in the room was wearing a mask. Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor who moderated the event, reported on Oct. 2 that the Trump family didn’t wear masks in the debate hall, while Biden’s supporters did. “There was a difference in the way the two families and their camps treated the health-safety regulations inside the hall,” Wallace said.
Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones added to the unfounded claims online, suggesting that the test result may be part of a “coup.” In a video address Oct. 2, Jones said that the result may have been a “false positive,” which would allow an adversary in the White House to poison the president’s soda and later say that he suffered from COVID-19.
Jones gave no evidence to support this theory. There is no evidence suggesting that the president’s illness is part of a coup.
But other purveyors of dubious claims echoed the fear of a coup, including a right-wing commentator who goes by Ali Alexander on Twitter. He warned his 126,000 followers that this may be a “second coup.”
Doomsday Plane Claims
A rumor spread across social media claiming that so-called “doomsday planes” were deployed because of Trump’s test result.
They weren’t.
Two E-6B Mercury planes were in flight around the time that Trump announced he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. But the flights were pre-planned and the timing was coincidental, Karen Singer, spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. Training flights like those are usually planned a year in advance, Singer said.
The planes, which have various nicknames, can be used as command centers and can launch land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. But that’s not what they were doing at the time.
Bogus Trump Campaign ‘Email’
An image that spread on Twitter early Oct. 2 purported to show an email from the president’s reelection campaign and suggested that the president was immediately using the COVID-19 diagnosis to raise money.
But as we reported, the Trump campaign confirmed to us that the image did not show an actual email from the campaign.
Instead, the image appeared to be a joke.
The bogus email claimed at one point that the goal was to raise “421 million.”
That is the same figure referenced in a New York Times investigation, which found that Trump “appears to be responsible for loans totaling $421 million, most of which is coming due within four years.”
Twisted ‘Hoax’ Remark
Critics of Trump reacted to the diagnosis by revisiting his handling of the pandemic. But some posts shared on social media distorted a statement that Trump made in February to do so.
“The coronavirus. This is their new hoax,” one Facebook meme misleadingly quoted Trump as saying.
Another meme criticizing Trump, posted by the Occupy Democrats page and shared 21,000 times, also repeated the same, faulty quote.
Trump didn’t say “the coronavirus” immediately before “this is their new hoax.” That’s how a Democratic super PAC later twisted the quote, as we wrote in April.
The actual remark dates back to a Trump rally on Feb. 28, when the president referred to Democrats’ “new hoax” after talking about the coronavirus. But, as we’ve explained before, he said the next day that he was describing Democrats’ finding fault with his administration’s response to the virus, not the virus itself.
Here’s a transcript of what he said during the rally:
Trump, Feb. 28: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, “How’s President Trump doing?” They go, “Oh, not good, not good.” They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. 
Trump went on to praise his administration for some travel restrictions the U.S. had implemented. “A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes,” Trump said, “and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?”
The next day, when asked about his use of the word hoax, Trump said he was “certainly not” referring to the virus itself.
“‘Hoax’ referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job,” he said. “The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here; I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.”

266,Trump Baselessly Suggests COVID-19 Deaths Inflated for Profit,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/,,"During a campaign rally in Wisconsin, President Donald Trump questioned the reported numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. by describing a purported “incentive” to report cases and deaths, because “doctors get more money and hospitals get more money.”
Trump’s comments tapped into a months-old, baseless conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence: that COVID-19 deaths have been inflated by hospitals seeking to profit. Multiple experts previously told us that such claims were unfounded.
Trump’s remarks came during an Oct. 24 rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin.
Trump, Oct. 24: If somebody’s terminally ill with cancer, and they have COVID, we report them. And you know, doctors get more money and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive. So some countries do it differently. If somebody is very sick with a bad heart, they die of COVID, they don’t get reported as COVID. So then you wonder, gee, I wonder why their cases are so low.
This country and their reporting systems are really not doing it right. If somebody has a really bad heart, and they’re close to death, even if they’re not, but they have a very bad heart and they get COVID, they put it down to COVID. Other countries put it down to a heart. So we have to be — we’re gonna to start looking at things because you know, they have things back — they have things a little bit backwards.
The supposed “incentive” referenced by Trump is likely a reference to the financial assistance for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients that was created by bipartisan legislation — and that Trump himself signed into law in March.
As we’ve explained, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, created a 20% add-on to be paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients with COVID-19; Medicare is the federal health insurance program for those 65 years and older. The law also set aside some money to reimburse hospitals for treating uninsured patients.
That fact alone is not evidence of misreporting or fraud, though — especially at levels large enough to significantly affect the country’s current death toll of 227,000.
Medical associations rejected the president’s suggestion that deaths were being improperly counted for financial reasons.
The American College of Emergency Physicians said in a statement it was “appalled by President Trump’s reckless and false assertions that physicians are overcounting deaths related to COVID-19.”
The American Medical Association challenged the claims by pointing to this year’s excess mortality in the U.S. — meaning the actual number of deaths from all causes, minus a “normal” or expected number of deaths during a given time period. That metric is an alternative way of estimating the impact of the coronavirus that avoids issues of miscounting or underreporting COVID-19 deaths. It also captures the indirect effects of the pandemic, such as those who died from other causes because they avoided or were unable to access medical care.
From late January through Oct. 3, there were an estimated 299,028 excess deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; about two-thirds were directly attributed to COVID-19. (The deaths in that report were based on death certificates from the National Vital Statistics System, which lags behind other measures because of the time it takes to complete and process certificates, the CDC told us.)
The U.S. does not have an especially good record on excess mortality compared to other countries, as we’ve reported.
According to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Oct. 12 that compared the U.S. to 14 other countries, America had a higher rate of per capita excess mortality than all but two nations since the start of the pandemic through late July. And University of Oxford economists Janine Aron and John Muellbauer concluded in a report published last month that the U.S.’s excess mortality rate is “substantially worse” than Europe’s.
To be clear, there could be some cases that are misreported. But experts also have said the official death toll may be underestimated, in part because excess mortality figures are higher.
We asked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services whether it could point to any specific cases of fraudulent reporting or billing for COVID-19 cases and it didn’t answer our question.
Instead, the agency noted the requirement of a positive COVID-19 test for the enhanced Medicare reimbursement — a requirement implemented in September — and said that if, upon review, the medical record lacks a positive test, that increased payment will be considered an overpayment and recouped by CMS.
Writing for Medscape, Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, said the enhanced payments came about because “policymakers knew that hospitals would need the extra money in order to provide their staff with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The federal government was not going to be able to provide all of the needed PPE. The funds were a way to help make hospitals whole. But it hasn’t. Most hospitals are bleeding money as a result of COVID.”
Jha said there have also been arguments about hospitals improperly reporting “car accident victims who tested positive for COVID” — which he called “nonsense.”
“There is no higher reimbursement that I can find for car accident victims who are COVID positive. And if you bill these patients as COVID pneumonia, that is fraud,” he said.
Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us in a phone interview that hospitals have other incentives for testing and identifying COVID-19 cases — regardless of whether someone is covered by Medicare — including making clinical decisions and taking precautions to prevent spread.
Schwartz also pointed out that the enhanced payments only apply to cases of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with COVID-19 — which represent a small fraction of the total U.S. cases.
According to CMS, there were 284,316 total COVID-19 hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries through Aug. 15. That is only 5% of the 5.3 million confirmed or probable cases in the U.S. reported as of that point in time.
And, Schwartz said, those Medicare payments are based on the diagnosis and diagnosis-related groups — not on outcomes or a death certificate.
That said, it’s worth understanding how COVID-19 deaths are classified.
Death certificates, as we’ve written, can list multiple causes or conditions that contributed to a person’s death. So the disease often shows up alongside other comorbidities. Those ailments could be caused by COVID-19, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or they can be long-term conditions, such as diabetes. It is well-known that seniors and people with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
But in 92% of death certificates in the U.S. citing COVID-19, the disease is listed as the underlying cause of death — meaning the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death — according to the CDC.
The CDC says that its “mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death” — including “the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate.”
Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told our colleagues at PolitiFact: “If a terminal patient still had, say 6 months to live, but was infected by the virus and died, the certifier might determine that COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death because of the timing.”
“In the same way, if that same terminal cancer patient was in a car accident and died from that trauma, the car accident would be the underlying cause,” Anderson said. “If, on the other hand, death from terminal cancer was imminent or COVID-19 symptoms were mild, COVID-19 might be viewed only as a contributing factor — not the underlying cause — or, if the patient was asymptomatic, it might not be viewed as a factor at all — and therefore, not reported on the death certificate.”

267,2020 Census Not Tied to Coronavirus Relief Payments,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/2020-census-not-tied-to-coronavirus-relief-payments/,,"Quick Take
The Trump administration and Congress are still negotiating a coronavirus economic stimulus package that will provide direct payments to some Americans. But this much is clear: eligibility will not depend on whether Americans respond to the 2020 census, as recent social media posts claim.

Full Story 
The Trump administration and the Congress recently announced their intention to send direct cash payments within weeks to U.S. citizens as part of a stimulus package to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.
But a post being shared on Facebook falsely claims that completing the 2020 census form — which began arriving in mailboxes across the country this month — is a prerequisite for receiving these payments. “Go to 2020census.gov and fill out this census form so you can get your stimulus check. That’s how they going to know where to send the checks,” the post claims, adding: “If you don’t fill it out you will not receive a check in the mail.”
That’s false. “Your [census] answers cannot be used to impact your eligibility for any government benefits, including any potential stimulus package,” the 2020 census website explains.
As we’ve reported, the Treasury Department proposed a plan that would provide loans to airlines and small businesses, as well as direct payments to individuals and families. 
The Treasury plan calls for two direct payments to taxpayers totaling $500 billion. The first payment would be issued within three weeks, and a second payment of the same amount in six weeks if the economic disruption caused by the pandemic continues.
Each payment to individuals “would be fixed and tiered based on income level and family size,” the Treasury plan states.
The details — including who is eligible and how much they will receive — are still being hashed out by Congress, as leaders of both parties continue to negotiate.
Under legislation proposed by Senate Republicans, according to the pro-business Tax Foundation, individual adults would receive $1,200 each, plus $500 for each child. At higher incomes, the checks would get smaller. The reductions start at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.
The Senate bill would use tax returns — not 2020 census information — as the basis for determining who is eligible and how much they will receive.
It is important to note that everyone living in the U.S. and American territories should complete the census forms arriving in the mail or go to 2020census.gov to participate. The Constitution mandates that the U.S. population be counted every 10 years in order to determine the number of representatives each state should have and to distribute federal funds. 
But the census will not be used to determine coronavirus-related relief benefits, and failure to complete this year’s census will not preclude an individual from receiving aid through this stimulus package.
Update, April 1: The president signed the $2 trillion stimulus package into law on March 27. Adults with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will receive $1,200 (married couples with an adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less will receive $2,400, plus $500 per child). The payment amount will scale down by income, phasing out at $99,000 for single individuals and $198,000 for couples without children.

A post circulating on social media falsely claims that a blend of sodium bicarbonate and lemon juice will “eliminate” the novel coronavirus. The post also claims this “cure” has prevented any COVID-19 deaths in Israel — but more than 30 people have died of the disease there.

Full Story
As COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, spreads around the world, numerous false and misleading claims of “cures” for the virus are spreading on social media.
A recent claim is from a post titled “In Israel No Death from COVID 19.”  It falsely states that the “cure” for COVID-19, “or the way to eliminate it,” has been discovered, and that it comes from Israel, where it says the virus “did not cause any death.”
In reality, as of April 2, more than 6,800 people in Israel have tested positive for COVID-19, and 36 have died. Over 100 people were in serious condition and 83 were on life support.
The post also claims that this “cure” is the reason that the “People of Israel is relaxed” about COVID-19.
Actually, the Israeli government has issued emergency regulations that include reducing entry to the public space, imposing responsibility on employers, closing non-essential stores and imposing restrictions on public transport, as well as “home isolation” guidelines.
The post’s “recipe” for the phony cure includes lemon and bicarbonate — short for sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which is commonly used as an antacid.
“Mix and drink as hot tea every afternoon,” the post says. “The action of the lemon with hotter baking soda immediately kills the virus [and] completely eliminates it from the body.”
This claim is baseless. According to the World Health Organization, “to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus.”
Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious diseases physician and fellow with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, confirmed this in an interview.
“There’s no data that shows using lemon juice or hot tea or anything like that would kill a virus,” she said.
Angela Rogers, assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center, noted in an email that “there is nothing that has been shown yet to kill or eliminate COVID-19 virus, and it’s still not clear whether any other therapies in the news (steroids, targeted immune modulators, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine) are actually helpful.”
Kuppalli said people can lower their risk of contracting the virus by washing their hands, covering their coughs and sneezes, maintaining distance from each other, and following public health measures that have been implemented in their area.

269,FactChecking Trump’s Attack on the WHO,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/factchecking-trumps-attack-on-the-who/,,"In announcing that his administration would halt funding for the World Health Organization, President Donald Trump made a series of false, misleading and unsubstantiated claims about the WHO:

Trump inaccurately said the WHO stated that the novel coronavirus “was not communicable.” The agency never went that far. In mid-January, the WHO shared “preliminary” information from China that “found no clear evidence” of human-to-human transfer, but it continued to consider such transmission possible.
The president also claimed there was “credible information” to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019. The WHO wasn’t notified of an outbreak in Wuhan until Dec. 31.
The president said the WHO “took China’s assurances” about the coronavirus “at face value … even praising China for its so-called transparency.” But early on Trump also thanked China for “their efforts and transparency,” and said he trusted that China would provide the U.S. with all of the necessary information.
Trump exaggerated when he said the WHO “actually fought” the U.S. over his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. WHO leaders have not publicly criticized the U.S. for that decision, although they did, and continue to, advise countries not to enact travel restrictions in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus.
Research has shown travel restrictions can delay the exportation of viruses, but they can’t contain the spread. But Trump repeated his claim, without evidence, that if he hadn’t put restrictions on travel from China, “probably hundreds of thousands more” would have died.

Trump made his announcement on funding at the White House coronavirus task force daily briefing on April 14, accusing the WHO of “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.” There is no evidence that the WHO has covered up the spread of the novel coronavirus. There has, however, been evidence that China was slow to report the outbreak. 
The South China Morning Post reported that the first coronavirus case in China can be traced back to Nov. 17, although China did not report it as a novel disease to the WHO until Dec. 31.
Trump’s announcement has been criticized by health experts and organizations, including the American Medical Association, which called it a “dangerous step” at a time when the pandemic worldwide has cost the lives of more than 130,000 people and counting. The U.S. provided more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019 — the most of any nation, according to the State Department.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the withholding of funds illegal and promised to challenge it.
WHO: Broad Mandate, Limited Powers
The World Health Organization, established in 1948 as part of the United Nations, has a broad role in coordinating international health policy. But while its mandate is large, its powers are limited.
Based in Geneva, Switzerland, and with six regional offices as well as representatives in countries around the world, the WHO is run by the World Health Assembly, made up of representatives of the WHO’s 194 member nations. Its director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former minister of foreign affairs and minister of health in Ethiopia, who was elected to a five-year term in 2017.
The WHO has had some important achievements over the years, including its role in eradicating smallpox in 1979. But it was heavily criticized for its slow response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. (See the Council on Foreign Relations’ website for a backgrounder on the WHO.)
The WHO, which has no direct authority over its 194 member states, describes as its key functions, among other things, “shaping the research agenda,” “providing leadership” on critical health issues, “setting norms and standards,” and monitoring and assessing health trends.
One of its vital roles stems from its exclusive authority to declare a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC. Since it received that power in 2007, it has done so six times, most recently during the current novel coronavirus pandemic. During such emergencies the WHO can issue guidelines on how countries should respond, including with travel and trade restrictions. But the guidelines are nonbinding; the organization has no enforcement powers.
In a recent report, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service explained the process for declaring public health emergencies:
CRS, March 16: Following the emergence of a disease that might be deemed a PHEIC, WHO convenes an advisory group, known as the IHR Emergency Committee, which reviews data to make recommendations to the WHO Director-General on control measures for the disease and whether to declare a PHEIC. The composition of this group varies per outbreak. The IHR Emergency Committee for Pneumonia Due to the Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, for example, is comprised of 15 scientists from around the world, including Dr. Martin Cetron from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The WHO Director-General usually follows the advice of IHR emergency committees regarding PHEIC declarations.
Although Trump accused the WHO of failing to provide “accurate information” in a “timely manner,” the organization is dependent on its members to report health crises. And historically some nations have been reluctant to do so in a timely manner. That was the case with China and SARS in 2003. And that has been an issue during the coronavirus pandemic, as China has been criticized for failing to be fully transparent about the disease, which originated there late last year.
Distortions on Transmissibility
One of Trump’s key claims is that the WHO misled the world about the virus’ ability to spread from person to person.
Trump, April 14: The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate, and investigate immediately. Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary.
Trump later stated that the WHO said the virus “was not communicable.” 
While there is a debate about what was known when — and it seems clear that China knew more than what it reported — the WHO never said the virus was not communicable. Instead, the agency always considered the possibility, even if it also shared information from China that found no evidence of such transmission.
Trump’s mention of mid-January is likely a reference to an early morning Jan. 14 tweet from the WHO. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities,” it said, “have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.”
Lack of evidence, especially of “preliminary” results, does not mean the WHO was saying the novel coronavirus could not be spread between people.
The same day as the tweet, the WHO cautioned that there might be some human-to-human transmission of the virus among family members in China.
“From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, the acting head of WHO’s emerging diseases unit, in a Jan. 14 news briefing. “But it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission.”
According to a timeline of events, Van Kerkhove, who is also the WHO’s technical lead for the COVID-19 response, also said that human-to-human transmission wouldn’t be unexpected, since that is what occurs with SARS and MERS, which are also coronaviruses.
Knowledge about those other viruses was also the basis for the WHO to recommend in its Jan. 10 technical guidance that health workers take precautions to avoid transfer of the virus from patients.
The day before, the WHO did report information it received from China about the virus, saying in a Jan. 9 statement, “According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.” But the organization also said “more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak,” and that “[f]urther investigations” were also needed to determine “modes of transmission.”
By Jan. 19, the WHO was more definitive, saying in a tweet that there was “some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.” 
And on Jan. 20, the WHO’s Western Pacific Region iterated the point. “It is now very clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission of #nCoV2019,” a tweet explained. “Infections among health care workers strengthen the evidence for this.”
A follow-up tweet also indicated the possibility of viral transmission that continues, rather than dying out in a small group of people. “In addition, info about newly reported #nCoV2019 infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission,” the WHO’s Western Pacific Region said. “But more information and analysis are needed on this new virus to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and other important details.”
After a WHO delegation visited Wuhan on Jan. 20 and 21, the organization also issued a statement, saying that “[d]ata collected through detailed epidemiological investigation and through the deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan.”
China publicly confirmed human-to-human transmission on Jan. 20, which included transfer between family members and to health care workers.
It is now obvious that the novel coronavirus spreads quite well in humans. But should the WHO have known that sooner? That’s exceedingly difficult to know, and as we explained earlier, the agency is dependent on countries to give it accurate information.
We can, however, provide some insight into Trump’s more specific claim that there was “credible information” to suggest human-to-human transmission in December 2019. That’s difficult to reconcile with the calendar because the WHO wasn’t notified about the cluster of unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan until the last day of the month. The agency requested more information from China on Jan. 1.
It has since come out that Taiwan, which is not a WHO member country because it is not recognized by China, claims it sent an email to the WHO asking about human-to-human transfer on Dec. 31. 
As an April 11 Reuters report explains, Taiwan wrote to the WHO because it was concerned about news reports on seven cases that indicated China was keeping patients in isolation. Even though it did not use the words “human-to-human transmission” in its email — which the WHO has noted — the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control has said that the language still should have been clear.
“Public health professionals could discern from this wording that there was a real possibility of human-to-human transmission of the disease,” the group said in a statement. “However, because at the time there were as yet no cases of the disease in Taiwan, we could not state directly and conclusively that there had been human-to-human transmission.”
Given that the WHO had just learned about the outbreak, and had no solid information to go on either, there’s nothing to support Trump’s claim that there was “credible evidence” that early on.
China’s Coronavirus ‘Transparency’
Trump also criticized the WHO for not doing more to make sure China was providing accurate information about the coronavirus outbreak within China’s own borders. Instead, Trump said, the WHO “took it just at face value … even praising China for its so-called transparency.”
What Trump didn’t say is that early on he, too, said he trusted what China was telling the U.S. about the virus.
Trump: Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source, with very little death — very little death — and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage.
Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency.
Trump is not alone in criticizing the WHO for simply accepting information coming from Chinese officials, and it’s true that WHO Director-General Tedros complimented China for its response to the outbreak in remarks on Jan. 30.
“As I have said repeatedly since my return from Beijing, the Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people,” Tedros said.
He continued: “We would have seen many more cases outside China by now – and probably deaths – if it were not for the government’s efforts, and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world. The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China’s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries.”
But Trump originally praised China for its supposed transparency as well.
During a Jan. 22 interview, CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Trump if he trusted the information coming from China and Trump said he did.
Kernen, Jan. 22: And President Xi — there’s just some — talk in China that maybe the transparency isn’t everything that it’s going to be. Do you trust that we’re going to know everything we need to know from China?
Trump: I do. I do. I have a great relationship with President Xi.
Two days later, Trump sent a tweet expressing appreciation to China for its “efforts and transparency.”

China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020

Two weeks after that, Trump told a reporter he didn’t think China was covering up information about the coronavirus, and said China was “doing a very professional job.”
Reporter, Feb. 7: Are you concerned that China is covering up the full extent of coronavirus?
Trump: No. China is working very hard. Late last night, I had a very good talk with President Xi, and we talked about — mostly about the coronavirus. They’re working really hard, and I think they are doing a very professional job. They’re in touch with World — the World — World Organization. CDC also. We’re working together.
And on Twitter, Trump said, “Great discipline is taking place in China.”

….he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone. Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2020

A few days later, when Fox News’ Trish Regan asked Trump about China’s transparency, Trump said China was “professionally run” and has “everything under control.”
Regan, Feb. 10: Some concerns that their economy is really going to tank because of this and that that could have a spillover effect here. What’s your sense of their transparency right now, whether they’re being more accommodating in terms of telling us what’s going on and how it affects our economy?
Trump: Well, I think China is very, you know, professionally run in the sense that they have everything under control. I really believe they are going to have it under control fairly soon. … But China I can tell you is working very hard.
A few days after that, in an iHeartRadio interview with Geraldo Rivera, Trump said he couldn’t be certain that China had been truthful about the virus but believed the country had “handled it professionally.”
Rivera, Feb. 13: Did the Chinese tell the truth about this?
Trump: Well, you never know. I think they want to put the best face on it. So you know, I mean, if somebody — if you were running it, you’d probably — you wouldn’t want to run out to the world and go crazy and start saying whatever it is because you don’t want to create a panic. But, no, I think they’ve handled it professionally and I think they’re extremely capable and I think President Xi is extremely capable and I hope that it’s going to be resolved. 
Then, in a press gaggle the following week, a reporter asked Trump if he was worried about data coming out of China, and he again complimented the Chinese president.
Reporter, Feb. 18: Some people don’t seem to trust the data coming out of China. Are you worried about that?
Trump: Look, I know this: President Xi loves the people of China, he loves his country, and he’s doing a very good job with a very, very tough situation.
Even a month later — during a press briefing in which Trump said that China had been “very, very secretive” and not transparent with the U.S. — the president defended his January remarks about China’s alleged transparency.
Reporter, March 21: [A]s you were saying, China was extremely secretive about this. Several of your advisors have been warning — have been critical of China. Secretary Pompeo was talking about it yesterday and he had been saying so —
Trump: Yeah.
Reporter: — for quite some time.
So, why then, on January 24, did you tweet that “China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus,” that “the United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.”
Trump: Because it’s true.
Reporter: Why were you saying that, though?
Trump: Because it’s true. China has worked very hard. China has lost thousands and thousands of people.
Reporter: But you said they weren’t transparent, right?
Trump: No, they weren’t transparent. They were transparent at that time, but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were.
When Trump was asked during the April 14 press briefing how he could criticize the WHO when “you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago,” he didn’t answer the question and instead talked about the trade deal he negotiated with China.
The WHO Didn’t ‘Attack’ Trump on Travel Restrictions
Trump said the WHO “attack[ed]” and “actually fought” the U.S. over Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China. The WHO leaders have not publicly criticized the U.S. for that decision, though they did, and continue to, recommend against countries enacting travel restrictions in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus.
On Jan. 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but the WHO’s emergency committee on the coronavirus said then it “does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.” At a press briefing that same day, WHO Director-General Tedros repeated that message, saying, “There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. WHO doesn’t recommend limiting trade and movement. We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.”
Nonetheless, the following day, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced travel restrictions to and from China, effective Feb. 2. The policy prohibited non-U.S. citizens, other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled to China within the last two weeks from entering the U.S.
So Trump is correct to say that his decision was made against the WHO’s general advice. But contrary to Trump’s claim, even as the WHO has held regular press briefings about the coronavirus, we couldn’t find evidence that the WHO’s leaders have publicly criticized the U.S. for that decision.
Trump was also mistaken that the WHO’s recommendation against travel bans was tied to a belief that the coronavirus was “not communicable.” The WHO maintained its recommendation against travel restrictions even after emerging information made clear that person-to-person transmission of the virus was happening. On Jan. 14, WHO officials in a press briefing said there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the virus, and that such transmission would not be surprising given the experience of SARS and other respiratory pathogens. And its Jan. 30 declaration that the coronavirus outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern came two days after the first reports of human-to-human transmission outside of China.
In its updated recommendations for international traffic on Feb. 29, the WHO said: “In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. Furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.”
The WHO added that travel restrictions “may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. Such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.”
That is part of long-standing policy at the WHO, which has said travel restrictions are largely ineffective and sometimes counter-productive.
A 2014 review of 23 studies on the impact of travel restrictions on the spread of influenza found overall they have “only limited effectiveness,” the degree of which varied depending on the restrictions themselves, epidemic size, transmissibility of the virus and other geographic considerations. The review, published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, said: “In isolation, travel restrictions might delay the spread and peak of pandemics by a few weeks or months but we found no evidence that they would contain influenza within a defined geographical area.”
According to a 2005 update of the International Health Regulations, a binding set of rules created by the 194-member states that govern and direct the WHO, countries that enact travel restrictions are required to provide the WHO “the public health rationale and relevant scientific information for it.”
International Health Regulations, 2005: A State Party implementing additional health measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article which significantly interfere with international traffic shall provide to WHO the public health rationale and relevant scientific information for it. WHO shall share this information with other States Parties and shall share information regarding the health measures implemented. For the purpose of this Article, significant interference generally means refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours.
Jimmy Kolker, a longtime U.S. diplomat and former assistant secretary for global affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration, told the health publication STAT that the U.S. was one of the principal authors of the IHR. The idea is not to discourage transparency by countries experiencing an outbreak who might fear financial repercussions if they report it.
“That’s the bargain at the heart of the revised IHR,” Tom Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told STAT.
Although the document is technically binding, it has no enforcement teeth, and, Bollyky told STAT, the WHO’s only recourse is to “name and shame” countries that run afoul of the IHR.
While WHO leaders have not publicly criticized countries that have enacted travel restrictions despite the WHO’s advice, like the U.S., they have occasionally reminded the public of countries’ responsibilities under the IHR.
For example, during a Jan. 29 press briefing, Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said that “ensuring that all measures that are being taken that affect travel, trade, and economy are based on rational public health evidence is very important. Again, the IHR is a framework that allows that to happen and that allows public health evidence and public health thinking to drive what are the measures that must be taken to minimize international spread while also minimizing the impact on travel and trade. That is essentially at the heart of what the IHR is about.”
“The IHR does not deny or prevent, it doesn’t prevent a country from taking measures, but what it does is it requires the countries to justify the risk assessment and the value of the public health measures from their perspective,” Ryan explained during a press briefing on Feb. 6. “So, we have to respect the fact that countries have to make certain decisions based on their circumstances, based on the threat that they perceive. And very often, sometimes, based on community perception. The cultural perception of fear for contagion is very different all over the world and governments have to respond also to community expectations and perceptions around protection of their health. So, governments are in a very difficult position. They have a very fine balance to strike. And what we try to do is make that decision transparent and we share that justification with all of the other member states, so at least other member states see what that justification is.”
Trump was also wrong to say that he was “the only leader of a country” that enacted travel restrictions on China. As we have written, dozens of countries imposed travel restrictions on China that came into effect before the United States’ restrictions did, according to ThinkGlobalHealth, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, which has been tracking the travel restrictions on China due to COVID-19.
One of the co-authors of the ThinkGlobalHealth tracker, Samantha Kiernan, told us the “data shows … that the United States was neither behind nor ahead of the curve in terms of imposing travel restrictions against China.”
“To be fair,” Kiernan added, “the United States was one of the first Western countries to impose any kind of formal travel restriction against China.”
Trump also is exaggerating when he says the U.S. “closed our borders tightly against China.” As we have written, there were exceptions to that halt on travel, including for Americans and their family members. According to a New York Times report on April 4, nearly 40,000 people had arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China since Trump imposed his travel restrictions. Moreover, the Times found, “screening procedures have been uneven” for those arriving on flights from China.
Finally, Trump claimed he was “the one person” in a room of “21 people” who wanted to enact the travel restrictions. We don’t know who was in the room with him – but, as we wrote when he made a similar boast, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the decision stemmed from “the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.”
Impact of U.S. Travel Restrictions
The research on the impact of travel restrictions shows they can delay the exportation of cases, if the restrictions are stringent, but they can’t contain the spread of viruses. Trump, however, repeated his claim that without his travel restrictions on China, “thousands and thousands of people would have died,” adding later, the figure would have been “probably hundreds of thousands more death.” We found no support for such figures.
As we’ve written, we didn’t find a study that looked at the U.S. travel restrictions alone. However, a study published in the journal Science on March 6 estimated that travel restrictions instituted in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and those put in place by several countries in early February regarding China would “only modestly” affect the spread of the pandemic. Travel restrictions could delay, but not stop, the spread of the disease, and social distancing and hand-washing behaviors would reduce the transmission of the disease, the study found.
Another study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences similarly found that travel restrictions and airport screenings in several countries “likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.”
Past studies also have found some delay in the spread of the diseases, if the restrictions are significant, but not containment.
We found only one study, which wasn’t peer-reviewed, on Australia, that found an impact on deaths. It estimated Australia’s restrictions on travel from China will lower the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in the country over the next year — but the study didn’t consider any impact of cases coming in from other countries. 
One issue hindering the potential impact of the U.S. restrictions, experts told us, was that they were limited, and the U.S. likely wouldn’t have picked up cases coming from other countries, such as Japan, Singapore, South Korea or even Italy. As we’ve also written, genomic analyses by two groups of researchers suggest a majority of the first cases of the coronavirus disease in New York City resulted from travelers from Europe — and that the virus was being spread around for weeks before the first confirmed case, announced on March 1. The president’s travel restrictions on the bulk of Europe went into effect on March 13. 
Also, while the U.S. restrictions on China went into effect on Feb. 2, Wuhan, where the outbreak began, had already suspended all air and rail travel in and out of the city on Jan. 23, and other cities in the province followed with their own restrictions.
Again, it’s possible the U.S. travel restrictions on China had some impact in slowing the importation of cases, but we don’t have evidence of what that impact was.
In the April 14 press conference, Trump also claimed that countries that hadn’t implemented travel restrictions on China now “have problems the likes of which they cannot believe.” But charts created by ThinkGlobalHealth on the growth in COVID-19 cases by country show no discernible pattern in the arcs of the disease between countries with travel restrictions on China and those without.
ThinkGlobalHealth has found that 96 countries and territories implemented some type of travel restrictions on China.",Jessica McDonald,2020-04-15 0:00:00,fake,,false,False,"For the purpose of this Article, significant interference generally means refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours.

Trump also is exaggerating when he says the U.S. “closed our borders tightly against China.” As we have written, there were exceptions to that halt on travel, including for Americans and their family members. The WHO, which has no direct authority over its 194 member states, describes as its key functions, among other things, “shaping the research agenda,” “providing leadership” on critical health issues, “setting norms and standards,” and monitoring and assessing health trends. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities,” it said, “have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.”
Lack of evidence, especially of “preliminary” results, does not mean the WHO was saying the novel coronavirus could not be spread between people. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.”
The WHO added that travel restrictions “may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures."
270,"Contrary to False Posts, Sanitizer Helpful Against Coronavirus",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/contrary-to-false-posts-sanitizer-helpful-against-coronavirus/,,"Quick Take
Screenshots circulating on Facebook falsely claim that hand sanitizer will “do nothing for the coronavirus.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says hand sanitizers with 60% alcohol can be used to help prevent contracting and spreading the virus.


Full Story 
While public health officials say frequently washing hands with soap and water is a main way to protect oneself from contracting or spreading the novel coronavirus, the outbreak has prompted a spike in the sales of hand sanitizers in the U.S. The demand has caused empty shelves and instances of price gouging — and had led some, including New York state, to make their own sanitizer.
But some on social media have wrongly claimed that hand sanitizers won’t help.

That falsehood surfaced in a March 1 tweet that was captured in screenshots, which have since circulated on Facebook.
The Twitter user — a self-identified “scientist” — argued that because “[h]and sanitizer is anti-bacterial” and “[t]he coronavirus is a virus,” sanitizers “will do nothing for the coronavirus.”
Actually, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instructs people to use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.
“Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing,” the CDC says. “If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.”
Likewise, the World Health Organization says that “[w]ashing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.”
Many experts have agreed that hand sanitizers work, too — because the alcohol, often ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, disrupts the outer membrane layer, or envelope, of viral particles.


“There is sound scientific basis for the effectiveness of alcohol-based hand-sanitizers for inactivation of commonly transmitted bacteria and viruses, especially lipid-enveloped viruses like coronaviruses,” Benhur Lee, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told us in an email. “Alcohol-based hand-sanitizers DO work against coronaviruses; this is what is universally recommended by hospital infection control to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS0CoV-2. However, alcohol-based hand-sanitizers complement but do not replace proper hand-washing with soap and water.”
Lee also pointed us to a recent Smithsonian Magazine article, citing multiple sources and scientific papers, that discusses the effectiveness of hand sanitizers. That article, citing Lee, noted that “[w]hile soap physically dismantles the envelope using brute force, alcohol changes the envelope’s chemical properties, making it less stable and more permeable to the outside world.”
The article continued: “Alcohol also can penetrate deep into the pathogen’s interior, wreaking havoc on proteins throughout the virus. (Importantly, not all viruses come with outer envelopes. Those that don’t, like the viruses that cause HPV and polio, won’t be susceptible to soap, and to some extent alcohol, in the same way.)”
Experts recommend working the sanitizer fully over both hands until completely dry.

271,Video Uses Bogus Claims to Stoke Race-Based Fears of COVID-19 Vaccine,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/02/scicheck-video-uses-bogus-claims-to-stoke-race-based-fears-of-covid-19-vaccine/,,"SciCheck Digest
A viral video clip makes bogus claims about COVID-19 vaccines and falsely accuses the government of “pure racism” for “push[ing] this heavily on Blacks and browns.” Public health experts have recommended prioritizing those communities for the vaccine because they have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic.

Dr. Simone Gold, who has a history of spreading dubious claims about the pandemic, used misinformation to sow doubt about COVID-19 vaccines in a live-streamed Jan. 3 address at a Pentecostal church in Florida.
The video featuring Gold’s roughly hourlong speech has been viewed tens of thousands of times on YouTube and Facebook. A shorter clip focused on claims about race was shared by a Facebook page that frequently posts about racial issues and describes itself as representing a nongovernmental advocacy organization. The page administrators are based in Ghana and the United Kingdom.
We’ll address the claims made in that clip.
One is a repeat of a vague claim we’ve debunked before — the suggestion that the vaccines are unsafe. (For more on this, please see our SciCheck story “Viral Video Makes False and Unsupported Claims About Vaccines.”)
Gold’s other false or misleading claims are aimed primarily at Black participation in the COVID-19 vaccination program. She misrepresents advice from public health experts who have advocated prioritizing vaccine distribution in the communities most severely impacted by the pandemic, which include Black, Latino and Native American people. (We’ll get to the statistics next.) And she says that Black people are being used as unwitting test subjects, a suggestion that exploits distrust of the medical establishment in the Black community.
Referring to the vaccine as an “experimental biological agent,” Gold, who is white, says in the video: “They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns.”
First of all, there are two available vaccines in the U.S. and both went through clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants before the Food and Drug Administration granted them each an emergency use authorization in December. The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed by the FDA and an outside panel of experts. So, calling either one an “experimental biological agent” is misleading.
Prioritizing At-Risk Communities
In the video, Gold also tells her audience: “The reason I don’t think this is ever going to be shown to be a race problem is things you just know by common sense. One is: It’s been all over the world, all races, OK? We can just start with that. Second is: In areas of the world where people … have those individual risk factors, like diabetes or obesity and other illnesses, and the group risk factors, such as living and working in tight quarters, it’s not Black people who get it at a worse rate, it’s those people in those situations.”
Public health experts have called for prioritizing certain members of minority communities in the rollout of the vaccines because those communities have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic.
Gold, however, misrepresents the reason for that recommendation, insinuating that experts say Black people are naturally more susceptible to COVID-19. But what they actually say is that social and historical factors have led to disparate health impacts on Black and some minority communities, which has led to elevated rates of illness and death from COVID-19.
For instance, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that Black patients have the highest rates of both diabetes and obesity among racial groups, which, as Gold points out, increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
“In the United States and worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the pervasive impacts of social and structural inequities in society,” a paper from the National Academy of Sciences making recommendations on the equitable distribution of the vaccines said. “COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on people who are already disadvantaged by virtue of their race and ethnicity, age, health status, residence, occupation, socioeconomic condition, and/or other contributing factors.”
According to data compiled at the end of 2020 by the CDC, Black Americans had a COVID-19 illness rate 1.4 times higher than their white counterparts and a death rate 2.8 times higher.
Similarly, a project of American Public Media that tracks the impact of the virus by race found that in 2020, Indigenous, Black and Latino residents were at least 2.7 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than white residents.
“The data on COVID-19 cases and deaths across many states in the U.S. have clearly shown that across all individuals getting the virus, Black and Brown people are disproportionately affected by and dying from this virus,” Renã A.S. Robinson, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses, in part, on racial health disparities, told us in an email.
“Biologically, the virus is looking for a host (e.g., a human body) to attack,” she said. “In the U.S., Black and Brown bodies have been disproportionately available for this virus to attack directly due to these communities having less access to equitable healthcare, high risk of exposure occupations, and increased burdens of chronic conditions — all directly related to historic systemic racism and ongoing discrimination and social injustices.”
The plan for distribution of the vaccines, including which populations should be prioritized, was largely left up to the states, though. So, the specific priorities of each state differed.
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which issues guidance on vaccine distribution, noted that “some racial and ethnic minority groups” have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Those groups are heavily represented in “essential” jobs, which have elevated exposure to the virus, ACIP wrote in its Jan. 1 recommendation, explaining that those jobs include: “first responders (e.g., firefighters and police officers), corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, U.S. Postal Service workers, manufacturing workers, grocery store workers, public transit workers, and those who work in the education sector (teachers and support staff members) as well as child care workers.”
ACIP did not recommend prioritizing the vaccine on the basis of race, but it did recommend prioritizing the vaccine for “essential workers.”
In the video, Gold repeatedly cites a report that she describes as “the government’s words,” when she accuses the government of unfairly targeting Black people. But it’s not a government document. It’s a report from Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security issued in August that sought to offer those tasked with making the distribution plan an ethical framework for distributing the COVID-19 vaccine.
After noting that Black people and Native Americans were hospitalized for COVID-19 at a rate five times higher than white people, the report said, “As a matter of justice, these disparities in COVID-19 risk and adverse outcomes across racial and ethnic groups should be addressed in our overall COVID-19 response.” But, again, that was advice offered more than three months before the first vaccine was authorized for use. It wasn’t binding and it didn’t come from the government.
Since the vaccines have become available, 16 states have publicly reported data on their usage by race and ethnicity, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. That data showed that “the share of vaccinations among Black people is smaller than their share of cases in all 16 reporting states and smaller than their share of deaths in 15 states,” according to KFF.
Addressing Community Skepticism
Later, Gold insinuates that Black people are being used as unsuspecting test subjects. “If you take the vaccine, you’re signing up to be in a pharmacovigilance tracking system,” she says.
It’s worth noting that a popular conspiracy theory had claimed the vaccines would include some kind of tracking device. They don’t.
Gold says that the government’s plan for distribution was “targeting the Black community,” which she calls “pure racism.” She goes on to say, “It means you’ve enrolled yourself in a medical trial. … Most people are not aware that that’s what they’re doing. This pharmacovigilance tracking system tracks you for two years. It’s set up by the Department of Defense. It was handed off to Oracle and Google to put the data together.”
Gold’s claims speak to entrenched fears and distrust in Black communities of medical institutions caused by experiments such as the Tuskegee study. Gold actually references this experiment in her speech, but fails to explain the difference between what happened then and what is happening now.
In 1932, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the U.S. government lied to Black men, telling them they were going to receive treatment for “bad blood,” while they were actually being studied for the effects of untreated syphilis.
Now, there are two tested and authorized vaccines available to the general public during a global pandemic.
Susan Rice, who is in charge of White House domestic policy for President Joe Biden, addressed the issue when she was asked at a press briefing about how to overcome vaccine hesitancy in Black communities.
She noted that Biden’s newly established COVID-19 task force is addressing health equity and said, “there are Americans, and particularly Americans of color, who for very valid historical reasons are skeptical and reluctant.”
Rice said that the task force “is reaching out directly through targeted campaigns to get to those very communities where the skepticism is highest. And that’s vitally important because as communities of color are suffering disproportionately, may have less access to information about the vaccine, and the ability to easily go online, in some instances, and get an appointment. We have to take those additional steps to ensure that they are aware of its availability, they can get appointments and that they understand that the vaccine is safe.”
It is also false that, as Gold claimed, by taking the vaccine “you’ve enrolled yourself in a medical trial.” Taking the vaccine after it’s been tested and authorized does not enroll a patient in a trial.
The “tracking system” that Gold appears to reference is actually an online management system for vaccine distribution and monitoring. One element is v-safe, an online portal to report side effects to the CDC. As we’ve explained before, trial data from the two currently available vaccines show that many people experience pain at the site of injection, fatigue, joint or muscle pain, headache, chills or fever — which, according to the CDC, “are normal signs that your body is building protection.” Use of that portal is optional, not mandatory, Oracle spokeswoman Kris Reeves confirmed to us by email.
CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund also confirmed to us by email that participation is voluntary.   
Another element of the system acts as a “national clearing house” for the CDC’s anonymized vaccination data, which means that the information doesn’t include patients’ identifying information. That data “will be used for analysis and reporting by authorized agencies and organizations,” Oracle wrote in a press release explaining the system.
Nothing in Oracle’s description of the system indicates that it would track individual patients.
A History of Disinformation
As we said at the start, Gold has a history of spreading dubious claims about COVID-19. She started an organization called America’s Frontline Doctors in the summer of 2020, although some of the most visible members of the group didn’t actually practice medicine on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gold is a licensed doctor in California, although it’s unclear how much she practiced during the pandemic. Gold told us that she worked at two hospitals in 2020, one of which is about 500 miles away from her home in Los Angeles. She also received $154,633 in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, part of the coronavirus relief package that passed in March 2020, according to a watchdog group tracking those loans, for businesses located at the address of her concierge medical business.
Also, the church where Gold spoke is run by Rodney Howard-Browne, a pastor who has advanced COVID-19 conspiracy theories and was arrested in March 2020 for holding services in violation of public health laws aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
In addition to conspiracy theories, Howard-Browne mixes politics into his religious messaging. He asserted, for example, that President Donald Trump should have remained in power despite having been voted out of office.
And, three days after she spoke at the church, Gold was filmed in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall after a mob had overtaken the building in an effort to overturn the election results and keep Trump in power. Gold was arrested on Jan. 18 and charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct.

272,"Biden, Trump Wrong About WHO Coronavirus Tests",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/biden-trump-wrong-about-who-coronavirus-tests/,,"Following a flawed rollout of test kits in the U.S. for the new coronavirus, politicians have given inaccurate information related to the diagnostic tests distributed by the World Health Organization.

Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed that the WHO “offered the testing kits that they have available” but “we refused them.” The U.S. did not actively turn down testing kits from the WHO, although it could have requested them. The kits, however, are primarily intended for lower income nations without testing capacity.
President Donald Trump also falsely claimed that the WHO test “was a bad test.” The test is highly accurate and has performed well.

Biden’s comments came during his one-on-one March 15 Democratic debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders, when he responded to a question about whether Trump was justified in complaining that inherited bureaucratic red tape hampered the administration’s response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.
Biden, March 15: No, look, the World Health Organization offered — offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.
Biden is right that the U.S. wanted to make its own test, but he leaves out important context — including the fact that many countries with the scientific capability designed their own tests, and that the WHO test kits are largely meant for less wealthy countries with weaker health systems. And he’s wrong that the U.S. ever “refused” a test from the WHO.
Trump’s claim appeared at the end of a March 17 press conference, when a reporter asked the president about Biden’s claim. 
Two other coronavirus task force members stepped in to respond, with coronavirus coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx discussing the importance of quality control and alluding to potential test defects, and Adm. Brett Giroir refuting the idea that the U.S. refused tests from the WHO. 
After both had spoken, Trump summarized things by saying, “So, number one, nothing was offered. Number two, it was a bad test. Otherwise, it was wonderful.” Trump is correct on the first point, but incorrect on the second — evidence indicates the test has performed well.

U.S. Didn’t ‘Refuse’ WHO Test Kits
Biden may have gotten the impression that the U.S. “refused” test kits from the WHO from a news report. A March 6 Politico story his campaign sent to us refers to the “Trump administration’s decision to forgo a World Health Organization test” and mentions that 60 countries received WHO tests. But Biden’s comments distort the situation.
“To our knowledge, no discussions occurred between WHO and CDC (or other USG agencies) about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the US,” WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told us in an emailed statement. “This is consistent with experience since the US does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.”
This point was also made by Giroir, a coronavirus task force member and the person in charge of coordinating diagnostic testing. 
Speaking in the same press conference in which Trump would incorrectly call the WHO test “bad,” Giroir said that when he became involved in the COVID-19 effort, he called the most “senior officials at the WHO as I could find,” and “as far as I can tell from sources that should know, no one ever offered a test that we refused.”
And during a CNN/Facebook town hall on March 19, Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, also debunked the notion.
“WHO developed the tests mainly to support countries with weaker health systems,” he said, noting that the U.S. has a “fabulous” scientific system and “a wonderful capacity” to develop tests. “So no, we did not offer the tests to the U.S., which would be standard practice,” he added. “If we were asked, obviously, we would have responded.”
The WHO told us that countries “did not have to pay” for the tests it distributed, which were produced by a manufacturer in Germany.
Rangarajan Sampath, the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, told us that the WHO tests are typically intended for low- and middle-income countries that lack the ability to test.
In part, this is because any assay, or test, the WHO might choose to produce could be easily manufactured in the U.S. or European Union, Sampath said, so the agency doesn’t usually supply kits to those countries.
Still, he said, any nation — even wealthy ones — can request a test kit from the WHO. “They don’t restrict them to low- and middle-income countries,” he said.
The WHO did not share a list of the 120 countries that it said were sent nearly 1.5 million tests as of March 16, but a survey of agency statements reveals that many are concentrated in poorer parts of the world that have less scientific expertise than the U.S. 
Around 40 of them appear to be African Union countries, which the WHO’s director-general said had acquired the ability to test by Feb. 26 “using lab kits sent by WHO.” The WHO has also said it assisted 29 countries in the Americas — including some Caribbean islands and much of South and Central America — and nations in Southeast Asia with testing supplies and training.
Countries the WHO has specifically named include Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and North Korea. 
Special attention has also been given to Iran, which on March 2 the WHO said it had supplied with 100,000 tests and on March 11 said it had given another 40,000 tests. That tally suggests that just under 10% of all the tests the WHO shipped went to Iran.
Biden presents the U.S. decision to make its own test as a critical error. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to our questions about its testing decisions. But it’s not unusual for the U.S. to proceed in this manner, and the agency likely started creating its test before any other test protocols were publicly available. 
Sampath said it’s common for nations with the scientific know-how to develop their own diagnostics. And indeed, the U.S. is one of several countries, such as China, Japan, Thailand and France, that did so for COVID-19.
As soon as the genome sequences of the new virus were released, Sampath said, various countries immediately started developing their own protocols and their own assays.
And the CDC did develop a viable test very rapidly. It’s not clear exactly when the test was first ready, but the agency successfully used its own test to identify the nation’s first COVID-19 case on Jan. 20 and a CDC report suggests the test was operational at least two days earlier. 
As we’ve explained before, the CDC ran into trouble in February when it scaled up production of its test kits to send out to public health labs around the country. The agency attributed the problem to a manufacturing defect with one of the three sets of reagents used to identify the virus. 
A little over two weeks after announcing the problem, the agency provided a fix, telling labs that the problematic assay using the third set of reagents could be scrapped without sacrificing test accuracy. But the manufacturing snafu, along with other limitations on which tests could be used and which labs could do testing, delayed the expansion of the nation’s testing capacity. The U.S., however, was never without the ability to test for COVID-19.
Sampath noted that even if the CDC had opted to use another test design, manufacturing errors could have still been a problem. 
“No matter which primers they were using,” he said, referring to one component of the test, “they could have had the same issue.”
The ‘WHO Test’
It’s worth pausing here to explain that the test the WHO has distributed is a modified version of the diagnostic test created by researchers at the Charité, a medical research institute in Berlin.
As with the CDC test, the German test uses a molecular biology technique known as the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to scan through a patient sample to see if the virus is present. Both tests are largely the same, but the short passages of the viral genome that each test checks for are different. 
Because the test did not originate with the WHO, it is not fully accurate to call the test the “WHO test.” 
In a March 7 statement, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn claimed as much, saying that the “WHO does not have its own test that it is distributing globally,” and that the organization has “only posted on its website protocols from some test developers, such as the CDC.” 
It’s true that the WHO didn’t develop its own test from scratch, but as we have already relayed, the organization has distributed more than 1 million tests, which is what many people have called “the WHO test.” (And for the purposes of this article, when we refer to the WHO test or test kit, we are referring to the tests the agency has shipped around the world.)
“The WHO selected this particular test for global distribution as it was modeled on the earliest published PCR protocol,” a WHO spokesperson told us, referring to the lab technique underpinning all of the molecular assays. The German protocol was first made available on Jan. 13 and announced in a press release on Jan. 16.
On the WHO website, the German test is listed along with designs from six other countries, including the United States’ submission. A disclaimer notes that the order of the listing “is by country” and “does not imply any preference of WHO,” and that the protocols “have not yet been validated through a WHO process.”
In other words, as Sampath told us, the WHO hasn’t endorsed a particular test and hasn’t said one is better than another, even though it did choose one to mass produce.
Not a ‘Bad’ Test
That brings us to how well the WHO test performs — and Trump’s false claim that the test was “bad.”
Trump may have concluded this from the way Birx responded when asked about Biden’s claim. She emphasized quality control of testing kits and said, “It doesn’t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.”
False positives are instances in which a test says a person has the disease when a person doesn’t — and should test negative. In the reverse problem, a person who has the disease can test negative when they are actually positive, in what’s called a false negative.
But there is no evidence that the WHO test doesn’t work well. Sampath, whose organization is now testing different COVID-19 assays from various manufacturers to provide independent verification for countries, said there are “no known issues” with the test. The WHO’s Ryan also said in a CNN interview that the test has performed “extremely well in the field, in multiple countries.” 
“The test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by WHO and manufactured in line with international quality standards,” a WHO spokesperson said. “It has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.”
The White House and the vice president’s office did not respond to our requests for comment or clarification. But Birx told the New York Times that the test she alluded to with a 47 to 50% false positive rate was not the WHO test, but rather a diagnostic used in China. 
A study there found that 47% or more of people who didn’t have symptoms and had been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 might have been improperly flagged as having the disease. The paper, however, has been retracted, and the English-language abstract didn’t report the test’s overall false positive rate.
NPR reported the retraction after FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn referenced the study again in an on-air interview. According to NPR, the retraction occurred a few days after publication on March 5. The retraction was not indicated on PubMed, the National Library of Medicine’s biomedical literature database, until March 26.

273,"Posts Take Old Photos of Biden, Harris Out of Context",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/08/posts-take-old-photos-of-biden-harris-out-of-context/,,"Quick Take
Facebook posts are using out-of-context photos to suggest Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, are not abiding by public health recommendations regarding face masks. The photos are from early March, before face masks were recommended by federal health officials.

Full Story 
Democrats gathered virtually for the Democratic National Convention this week in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But as the remote event took place, thousands of Facebook users shared old, out-of-context photos of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, with a false suggestion that the candidates are holding rallies flouting public health guidance.
The posts show photos of Biden and Harris — along with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Sen. Cory Booker — together on stage at a crowded campaign rally. No one is wearing face masks.
“Notice! No Masks. Your Being Played!!!” reads the text in some of the memes. Another claims: “Not a mask in sight. Tell me again why we are being forced to wear one.”
The photos are actually from a rally held in a high school gym in Detroit on March 9, as a C-SPAN video shows. The event took place shortly after Harris ended her own presidential bid and endorsed Biden.
At the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not recommend the use of face masks by the public except for those who were sick or treating someone who was ill. The agency in April issued new guidance recommending cloth face masks be worn in public settings to help curb the spread of the disease.
On March 13, days after the Biden campaign event, President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The same day, Michigan announced a temporary prohibition on large gatherings.
On April 24, Whitmer issued an executive order requiring the use of face coverings in “enclosed public spaces.”
Biden recently called on governors to issue a three-month mandate on wearing masks outdoors and also proposed a national mask mandate during his convention speech.

274,Timeline of Trump’s COVID-19 Comments,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/timeline-of-trumps-covid-19-comments/,,"President Donald Trump announced in the early hours of Oct. 2 that he and the first lady had tested positive for COVID-19. By late afternoon, the White House said that “out of an abundance of caution” the president was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he would spend the next few days.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, the president has been downplaying the risks of COVID-19 — questioning the effectiveness of masks, touting unproven treatments and criticizing his own health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Here is a timeline of the president’s comments on COVID-19 and his administration’s handling of it.
January
In the early days of what would turn out to be a pandemic, the president repeatedly minimized the threat posed by the novel coronavirus.
Jan. 20: The first confirmed coronavirus case is reported in the United States.
Jan. 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” — Trump in a CNBC interview.
Jan. 30: The World Health Organization declares a public health emergency of international concern.
Jan. 30: “We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five — and those people are all recuperating successfully. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries, and we think it’s going to have a very good ending for us … that I can assure you.” — Trump in a speech in Michigan.
Jan. 31: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declares a public health emergency for the U.S.

February
Trump privately tells journalist Bob Woodward that the novel coronavirus is “deadly stuff,” but continues to tell the public that it is “under control,” even suggesting that it could go away in the spring.
Feb. 7: “It goes through air, Bob. That’s always tougher than the touch … You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed. And, so that’s a very tricky one. … It’s also more deadly than your – you know, your, even your strenuous flus. … This is more deadly. This is 5, you know, this is 5% versus 1% and less than 1%. You know, so, this is deadly stuff.” — Trump in an interview with Woodward, released in September.
Feb. 10: “Now, the virus that we’re talking about having to do — you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases — 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.” — Trump at the White House. (See our item “Will the New Coronavirus ‘Go Away’ in April?“)
Feb. 14: “There’s a theory that, in April, when it gets warm — historically, that has been able to kill the virus.  So we don’t know yet; we’re not sure yet. But that’s around the corner.” — Trump in speaking to National Border Patrol Council members.
Feb. 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” — Trump in a tweet.
Feb. 26: “So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.” 
“I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up.” — when asked if “U.S. schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading.”
“I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it that — and I spoke with Dr. [Anthony] Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it: The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And, so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and their recovery, one is — one is pretty sick but hopefully will recover, but the others are in great shape. But think of that: 25,000 to 69,000. Over the last 10 years, we’ve lost 360,000.” 
“But that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.” — Trump at a White House coronavirus task force briefing.
Feb. 27: “It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” — Trump at a White House meeting with African American leaders.
Feb. 28: “So a number that nobody heard of that I heard of recently, and I was shocked to hear it, 35,000 people on average die each year from the flu. Did anyone know that? … They say usually a minimum of 27, goes up to 100,000 people a year die, and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t. But think of it, you hear 35 and 40,000 people and we’ve lost nobody. You wonder, the press is in hysteria mode.”
“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. … They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.” — Trump at a rally in North Charleston, South Carolina.
Feb. 29: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announces the first confirmed death from COVID-19 in the United States. Later, autopsy results in California attributed two deaths in early and mid-February to the disease.
“No. No. No. Hoax referring to the action that they [Democrats] take to try and pin this on somebody because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them not … I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax.” — Trump in a coronavirus task force briefing, when asked if he regretting using the word “hoax” the night before.
March
By mid-March, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic; the Trump administration took steps to slow the spread; and the president and the remaining Democratic candidates stopped staging public campaign events. But by the end of the month, Trump talked about reopening the U.S. and having “packed churches all over our country” for Easter.
March 2: Trump holds a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, his last rally before coronavirus shutdown measures are implemented across the country. Crowd-size estimates ranged from 7,000 to 15,000 people, according to WRAL-TV in Raleigh.
“My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the coronavirus,” he says. “We had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies and they’re going to have vaccines. I think relatively soon and they’re going to have something that makes you better and that’s going to actually take place, we think, even sooner.”
“I think it’s very safe,” Trump tells reporters that morning when asked whether having rallies during a public health crisis was safe.
March 4: “[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40-plus people [from a cruise ship]. … We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers. But if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.” — Trump at a White House meeting with airline CEOs.
“Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number.” — Trump in an interview on Fox News, referring to the percentage of diagnosed COVID-19 patients worldwide who had died, as reported by the World Health Organization. (See our item “Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.”)
March 6: “We’ve had 11 deaths, and they’ve been largely old people who are — who were susceptible to what’s happening. Now, that would be the case, I assume, with a regular flu too. If somebody is old and in a weakened state or ill, they’re susceptible to the common flu too. You know, they were telling me just now that the common flu kills people and old people is sort of a target.” — Trump after a tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
March 7: “No, I’m not concerned at all. No, we’ve done a great job with it.” — Trump, when asked by reporters if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the Washington, D.C., area. 
March 9: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” — Trump in a tweet.
March 10: “And we’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.” — Trump after meeting with Republican senators.
March 11: The WHO declares the global outbreak a pandemic. 
The confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. hit 1,000. Testing is still limited. According to the COVID Tracking Project, there have been 20,166 test results in the country. Deaths number 31 people.
March 13: Trump declares a national emergency concerning the coronavirus.
March 15: “This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.” — Trump at a White House task force briefing.
March 16: The White House announces recommendations for a 15-day period to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including staying at home if you feel sick, have a household member who tests positive or are older or have a serious health condition. 
“When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. … If you’re talking about the virus, no, that’s not under control for any place in the world. … I was talking about what we’re doing is under control.” — Trump at a White House task force press briefing.
March 17: “I’ve always known this is a — this is a real — this is a pandemic. I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” — Trump at a White House task force press briefing.
March 19: “To be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.” — Trump in an interview with journalist Woodward, released in September.
March 23: “People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death. Probably and — I mean, definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus.” — Trump at a White House task force briefing.
March 24: “So I think Easter Sunday and you’ll have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time. And it’s just about the timeline that I think is right.” — Trump in an interview on Fox News.
“I brought some numbers here, we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, ‘Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.’ We have to get back to work.” — Trump at a Fox News virtual town hall.
March 26: The U.S. has 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, more than any other country. The death toll hits 1,000.
March 29: “So you’re talking about 2.2. million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job.” — Trump at a White House task force press briefing.
March 30: The White House extends its “slow the spread” recommendations to April 30. 
“We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery. We think, by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening.” — Trump in announcing the extension of those recommendations.
March 31: “I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense, they said, ‘Why don’t we ride it out?’ A lot of people have said, a lot of people have thought about it, ‘Ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu.’ But it’s not the flu.” — Trump at a White House task force briefing.
April
The president undermines the CDC’s recommendation on wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, urges governors to open up their states and suggests ways to use ultraviolet rays and disinfectant to treat COVID-19.
April 1: “Because remember, after a month or so — I think once this passes, we’re not going to have to be, hopefully, worried too much about the virus.” 
“Together, we have the power to save countless lives. We’re attacking the virus on every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation, and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early — far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.


April 2: “We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus, as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine. And we’re making a lot of progress. I think, medically, a lot of progress.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 3: The CDC recommends that people begin “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”
“So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it. They suggested for a period of time. But this is voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it. … So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay. It may be good. Probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation. It’s voluntary.” — Trump in a task force press briefing, announcing the CDC recommendation on face masks. 
April 5: “We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we’ll be very proud of the job we all did. We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we’re going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum — the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 8: “I also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration’s ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus. And that’s happening. And it’s happening, I think if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought. Maybe a lot more quickly, I hope. And it’s something that all over the world we’re watching, but people are watching us and seeing what we’re doing, and they’re very impressed.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 13: “America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide. … This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines.” — Trump in a task force press briefing. 
April 16: “As we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead. Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly. If the virus returns in the fall, as some scientists think it may possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 17: “I don’t want people to think that this going to be like this forever. But, for a period of time, we’re going to have to keep it that way. That includes baseball games and football games, and other things. But eventually, as this virus goes away, it’s going to be better and better.” — Trump in a task force press briefing  
April 20: “We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.  
April 21: “Therefore, in order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States; you heard about that last night.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 22: “This virus will eventually be gone. And if it should show up in the fall, we’re going to put it out very fast.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 22: “No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that.” — Trump at a task force press briefing.


April 23: “So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you’re going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it’d be interesting to check that. So that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful.” — Trump in a task force press briefing.
April 24: “This is where they’ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact, negatively, on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity, and it doesn’t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn’t live well with heat and sun and disinfectant. And that’s what I brought out. And I thought it was clear.” — Trump in a bill signing ceremony, when asked to “clarify your comments about injections of disinfectant” from the previous day.  
April 28: Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. hit 1 million. More than 57,000 people in the country have died from the virus.
April 29: “I don’t want people to get used to this because this virus is going to be gone. And when it’s gone, you want to get back to normal. You’re not going to have a stadium that’s 30% the size of what it was three months ago. If I watch Alabama play LSU, I don’t want to see 20,000 people instead of 120,000 people. We want it to be the way it was. Now, we going to wait until it’s gone. And it will be gone. And we’ve done a lot to get rid of it. But we — we want to open our country. The people want this country open.” — in a roundtable with industry executives.
April 30: “But as far as where I’m going in Arizona, I’m going to have to look at the climate. I’d have no problem wearing a mask. I don’t know. I’m supposed to make a speech. I just don’t know: Should I speak in a mask? You’re going to have to tell me if that’s politically correct. I don’t know. If it is, I’ll speak in a mask.” — Trump in White House remarks, when asked about wearing a mask during his upcoming visit to Arizona on May 5.
May
In May, the number of U.S. coronavirus deaths passed 100,000, and the president disclosed he was taking an unproven treatment — hydroxychloroquine — to prevent COVID-19. 
May 3: “On Jan. 23, I was told that there could be a virus coming in, but it was of no real import. In other words, it wasn’t, oh, we have got to do something, we have got to do something. It was a brief conversation.” — Trump in a Fox News town hall, when asked about reports that he was briefed on the threat of the virus in January.
“Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner … ” — Trump in a tweet.
May 5: “You know, the virus will pass. There’ll be more death, that the virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal. But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it.” — Trump in an ABC News interview.
May 6: “I mean, I had a mask on, but I didn’t need it. And I asked specifically the head of Honeywell: ‘Should I wear a mask?’ And he said, ‘Well, you don’t need one in this territory.’ And as you know, we were far away from people, from the people making the masks. They were making the masks.” — Trump at a White House signing ceremony, when asked if he wore a mask during his Arizona visit.


“Will it come back in a small way? Will it come back in a fairly large way? But we know how to deal with it now much better. You know, nobody knew anything about it, initially. Now we know we can put out fires. We can put out — I call them ’embers’ if it’s a small — or if it’s a fire or a hotspot, we could put it out.” — Trump at the same signing ceremony.
May 8: “Well, I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine. It’s going to go away, and it’s — we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time. You may have some — some flare-ups and I guess, you know, I would expect that. Sometime in the fall, you’ll have flare-ups maybe. Maybe not. But according to what a lot of people say, you probably will. We’ll be able to put them out.” — Trump in a meeting with Republican members of Congress.
May 11: “Coronavirus numbers are looking MUCH better, going down almost everywhere. Big progress being made!” — Trump in a tweet.
May 14: “So we have the best testing in the world. It could be that testing is, frankly, overrated. Maybe it is overrated.” — Trump in remarks at Owens & Minor Inc. Distribution Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
May 18: “I’m taking it — hydroxychloroquine. … Right now. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago, I started taking it. … Because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories.” — Trump in a roundtable with restaurant executives. (See our story “Trump Misleads on Hydroxychloroquine, Again.”)
May 19: “So when we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing; I look at that as — in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.” — Trump in a cabinet meeting.
May 25: “Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19, sometimes referred to as the China Virus. Ventilators, Testing, Medical Supply Distribution, we made a lot of Governors look very good – And got no credit for so doing. Most importantly, we helped a lot of great people!” — Trump in a tweet.
May 27: More than 100,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the U.S.
May 29: “Our nation continues to mourn for the lives claimed by the virus and grieve for the families who have lost loved ones.” — Trump in a roundtable discussion with executives on reopening the country.
June
About a week after the number of confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 topped 2 million on June 11, Trump held an indoor rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma — the first since the pandemic began. He also attempted to refute the rising number of cases by falsely claiming, “If we didn’t do testing, we’d have no cases.”
June 3: “I also think by the end of the year we’ll have a vaccine. We’re doing very well. I just had a meeting yesterday. I think we’re going to have therapeutics, and I think we’re going to have cures. So we’re going to be in very good shape.” — Trump in a Fox Radio Network interview.
June 5: “I think, in the fall, you’re going to see the schools all open and in great shape.” — Trump at a medical products firm in Maine.
June 11: Confirmed cases top 2 million.
June 17: “I think it’s time to start our country up again, basically. And could we keep it shut longer? Personally, I don’t think so. I don’t think people would take it. And I think it would be the wrong thing to do.”
“On coronavirus, I acted very quickly, and I acted early. And they can’t get over it. Number one. Number two. If I didn’t act, we would have had 3 million deaths. And instead we’re at 110,000. And we could be heading to a number that’s, you know, higher than 150,000 to [200,000], it could be ending all now depending on how it goes.” — Trump in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.
“The children, the numbers are very, very small, almost — almost nonexistent. And it’s an incredible thing. Their immune system is very strong. And so we have to get the schools open.” — Trump in a Fox News interview.
June 20: “They call me, they say the job you’re doing — here’s the bad part, when you test of — when you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So, I said to my people slow the testing down, please.” — Trump at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, indoor rally, his first since the pandemic was declared in March.
June 25: “So, we have more cases because we do the greatest testing. If we didn’t do testing, we’d have no cases. Other countries — they don’t test millions. So we’re up to almost 30 million tests. So when you do 30 million, you’re going to have a kid with the sniffles, and they’ll say it’s coronavirus — whatever you want to call it.” — Trump in a televised virtual town hall. (See our story “Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge ‘Only’ Due to Testing, Misleads on Deaths.”)
July
At the start of July, the president talked about “progress” and how the virus will “sort of just disappear.” But the president later canceled the Jacksonville, Florida, portion of the Republican convention, as U.S. coronavirus cases exceeded 4 million and deaths topped 150,000, including the death of Trump supporter and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain.
July 1: “Well, I don’t know if you need mandatory [requirements], because you have many places in the country where people stay very long distance. You talk about social distancing. But I’m all for masks. I think masks are good. I would wear — if I were in a group of people, and I was close. … I mean, I would have no problem. Actually, I had a mask on. I sort of liked the way I looked, OK? I thought it was OK. It was a dark black mask, and I thought it looked OK. Looked like the Lone Ranger.” 
“I think we are going to be very good with the coronavirus. I think that, at some point, that’s going to sort of just disappear, I hope.” — Trump in a Fox Business Network interview.
July 4: “We’ve made a lot of progress. Our strategy is moving along well.” — Trump marking Independence Day with remarks in Washington, D.C.
July 9: “They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks. Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don’t wear a mask, don’t wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask.” — Trump in a telephone interview with Sean Hannity, referring to scientists’ recommendations on wearing face masks. 
July 14: “Well, I’d say listen to that instruction, listen to your governors. But I have to say the same people that say wear a mask are people that said, a long time ago, don’t wear a mask, masks are bad. They said they’re not good. So, you know, like Dr. Fauci, surgeon general, a lot of people — a lot of people — the surgeon general said that also.” — Trump in a CBS News interview.


“I don’t agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our surgeon general — terrific guy — said don’t wear a mask. Everybody who is saying don’t wear a mask — all of sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask, and as you know masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors.” — Trump in a Fox News interview.
July 17: “We had great rallies in Wisconsin and all over the country, and unfortunately until this gets solved … it’s going to be tough to have those big massive rallies.” — Trump in a virtual Wisconsin tele-rally.
July 20: “We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!” — Trump in a tweet.
July 21: “We’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They’ll have an effect.” — Trump in a press briefing.
July 21: “Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better — something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.” — Trump at a White House briefing.
“You will never hear this on the Fake News concerning the China Virus, but by comparison to most other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well – and we have done things that few other countries could have done!” — Trump in a tweet.
July 22: “I believe that you should wear it, even if there’s a 1% chance it helps. You know, when you look at Dr. Fauci and others — and this isn’t a knock, because this is just the way it — if you look, early on, they were all saying, don’t wear a mask. Don’t wear a mask. That didn’t make total sense to me, but don’t wear a mask. Now they’re all saying, wear a mask. My attitude is, it probably helps. Give it a shot, because we have to win this thing.” — Trump in a Fox News interview.
July 23: Confirmed cases hit 4 million in the U.S.
“We’re setting an example. We don’t want to have people so close together.” — Trump in a Fox News interview, when asked about the decision to cancel convention activities scheduled for Jacksonville, Florida, and move the event back to North Carolina.
July 28: “We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country; it’s — it’s corona-free.” — Trump at a White House briefing.
July 29: Deaths in the U.S. attributed to COVID-19 surpass 150,000.
July 30: “Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. I got to know him very well. And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus.” — Trump at a White House briefing, referring to the former Republican candidate for president, who attended Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
July 31: “The single best way to defeat the disease is personal responsibility. You’ve heard me say it. You’ve heard a lot of people say it, actually. I urge all Americans to protect the elderly. The fact is you have to do the social distancing thing. It’s very important. Socially distance. Wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places or socially distance. And wash your hands as often as possible.” — Trump during a roundtable in Belleair, Florida.
August
The president started the month with an interview where he said, when asked about COVID-19 deaths, “it is what it is.” He continued to urge Americans to social distance, but he also disregarded New Jersey’s social distancing requirements by holding a press briefing attended by supporters at his golf club in the state. During the month, U.S. COVID-19 cases passed 5 million and, 22 days later, exceeded 6 million.
Aug. 3: “They are dying [of coronavirus]. That’s true. And it is what it is.” — Trump in an interview with Axois.
“Very, very important — protect the elderly. It’s much different. Young children have very strong immune system",Eugene Kiely,2020-10-02 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"March 31: “I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense, they said, ‘Why don’t we ride it out?’ A lot of people have said, a lot of people have thought about it, ‘Ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu.’ But it’s not the flu.” — Trump at a White House task force briefing. And so, if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — that’s a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job.” — Trump at a White House task force press briefing. (See our story “Trump Falsely Says COVID-19 Surge ‘Only’ Due to Testing, Misleads on Deaths.”)
July
At the start of July, the president talked about “progress” and how the virus will “sort of just disappear.” But the president later canceled the Jacksonville, Florida, portion of the Republican convention, as U.S. coronavirus cases exceeded 4 million and deaths topped 150,000, including the death of Trump supporter and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. June 20: “They call me, they say the job you’re doing — here’s the bad part, when you test of — when you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. April 1: “Because remember, after a month or so — I think once this passes, we’re not going to have to be, hopefully, worried too much about the virus.”

275,FactChecking Ad About Donating ‘Our Masks and Supplies’ to China,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/factchecking-ad-about-donating-our-masks-and-supplies-to-china/,,"A Democratic group’s ad attacking President Donald Trump leaves the misleading impression that medical equipment donated by U.S.-based organizations and businesses to China early in the global coronavirus outbreak came from the Trump administration.
“He shipped China 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies,” says the ad from American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC, referring to Trump. “Our masks and supplies. Supplies we need now.”
It’s true the State Department was involved in delivering to China tons of personal protective equipment donated by American companies and organizations in early February. The State Department even lauded the donations as “a testament to the generosity of the American people,” and said they were an example of “strong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.”


But the medical supplies were not “American” or “ours” in the sense that they belonged to the federal government, which the ad’s language may lead viewers to believe. The equipment was donated by those companies and organizations specifically for use by health care workers in China.
The 30-second commercial, titled “Trust,” started running this week in select media markets in the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The super PAC said it’s “the first wave of a $15 million campaign” to counter TV spots airing from a pro-Trump group, America First Action. 
So far, the ad has run in those three states — which Trump won by only about 80,000 votes combined — at a cost of nearly $190,000, according to Advertising Analytics.

The ad starts by highlighting complimentary remarks Trump made about China, which reporting shows was slow to report the outbreak of the new coronavirus that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan near the end of 2019. (We previously wrote about some of Trump’s comments praising Chinese President Xi Jinping’s response to what has now become a global pandemic.)
The ad’s narrator then goes on to say: “Trump gave China more than praise. He shipped China 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies — our masks and supplies. Supplies we need now. Trump trusted China, sent China our supplies, and just look at the mess we’re in now.”
Actually, the supplies were donated by U.S.-based organizations and businesses in a humanitarian gesture at a time when nearly all of the reported cases of and deaths from the novel coronavirus were in China. 
On Feb. 7, the director-general of the World Health Organization declared that there was a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE, and that “[f]rontline health workers in China require the bulk of PPE supplies.”
The same day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the State Department had “facilitated the transportation” of almost 18 tons of “donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.” The donations were loaded onto State Department-chartered planes that were already headed to China that week to bring back hundreds of U.S. citizens stranded in the country.
About a week later, the department provided a little more information about the delivery it helped coordinate with Project HOPE, an international health training and humanitarian organization that has worked in Wuhan since the 1990s.
Department of State, Feb. 15: Last week, thanks to a joint effort of federal and local authorities and private organizations and companies, 17.8 tons of personal protection equipment and medical supplies were delivered, and more than 800 people were evacuated from Wuhan, China, amidst the Novel Coronavirus outbreak.
A number of organizations, companies, and private entities donated life-saving aid and supplies. Project HOPE received and distributed 101 pallets of personal protection equipment and medical supplies provided by Samaritan’s Purse, Boeing, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Intermountain Healthcare.
A spokeswoman for Project HOPE confirmed to FactCheck.org that the group received the donations.
“The only supplies received by Project HOPE in China that were transported on State Department-chartered flights were the nearly 17.8 tons donated by American relief organizations and businesses to help China’s doctors and nurses contain the COVID-19 outbreak,” Rebecca Gustafson, senior director of global media relations at Project HOPE, said in an email.
Boeing had already announced on Jan. 29 that it was preparing to donate “250,000 medical-grade respiratory masks to address medical supply shortages in China.” A spokesperson for the aviation giant told us in an email that the company’s donation was included as part of the shipment for Project HOPE in China.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also announced on Jan. 29 that it was partnering with the humanitarian group and donating to China 220,000 respirator masks, 870 pairs of protective goggles and over 6,500 pairs of protective coveralls. The article on its website said the church’s president decided to make the donation after inquiring and learning from “longtime friends in China” of a need for “protective equipment at the Shanghai Children’s Medical Center, where supplies have been depleted because of the outbreak in Wuhan.”
In an update to that article days later, the church said the supplies were delivered to China on Feb. 4 — the same day the planes chartered by the State Department arrived in China.
And a spokeswoman for Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian disaster relief organization, told us it “donated 78 pallets of medical supplies and personal protective equipment to Hubei, China” for coronavirus assistance. “The State Department facilitated the delivery of these items,” she said in a statement.


On the day all of the contributions were delivered, the WHO reported that there were more than 20,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and more than 400 deaths there due to the disease. At the same time, there were 11 confirmed cases in the U.S, and the first reported death from the illness in the U.S. didn’t come until Feb. 29, more than three weeks later.
The super PAC told us its ad was simply stating the facts about the shipment.
“As the Washington Post’s own reporting and multiple fact-checking organizations have already verified, the president’s own state department, as they said themselves, shipped 17 tons of American masks and medical supplies to China in February under the president’s own direction,” said Jeb Fain, spokesman for American Bridge. “Those are the facts and they’re not up for debate. This president doesn’t get to avoid accountability now that he finds it politically inconvenient.”
It’s not for us to say whether the federal government should have been involved in delivering the much-needed materials to China when the U.S. would later experience a coronavirus-related PPE shortage of its own.
But readers should know that when the American Bridge ad says Trump sent “our masks and supplies” to China, it’s a reference to equipment American companies and businesses donated specifically to help health officials in China. The PPE did not come from the government’s own reserves nor was it assigned for use in the U.S.

276,Trump’s Misleading Ad on Coronavirus Testing,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trumps-misleading-ad-on-coronavirus-testing/,,"A new Trump campaign ad claims that President Donald Trump took “fast action” in regard to testing for the novel coronavirus. While “fast action” is subjective, pandemic experts say the U.S. did not move quickly to set up an adequate system and in fact lagged behind other countries.
We have reported several times on a number of snags and miscues that prevented robust, widespread early testing.
“The United States has lagged nearly every developed country in ramping up testing, and the slow action is one reason why we have the worst epidemic in the world and are discussing reopening when it is not safe to do so, while other countries have used testing as a centerpiece of their strategy to reduce cases to a point where reopening is much more appropriate,” Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email. “The lack of testing has been not only a public health catastrophe in the US, but also is a direct cause of our economic suffering.”
Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in an email: “We need only look at other countries (like South Korea, Germany, Singapore, New Zealand and others) to see what rapid testing and identification can do to slow down spread of this virus. South Korea had done 150,000 tests before we had done 500. The fact that we have more deaths per million in the population than many other developed countries is a testament to our slow response to this virus.”
The new 30-second ad, called “Tough Steps,” first aired May 5 in Indiana. The Trump campaign has spent more than $200,000 on the ad so far, according to Advertising Analytics.

The ad also includes a number of false and unsubstantiated claims that Trump has made before.
It says he “banned Chinese and European travel to the U.S.” While Trump did impose restrictions, as we have reported, they included exceptions, so they weren’t actual “bans.” For example, the New York Times reported that nearly 40,000 people flew directly from China to the U.S. in the two months after the China restrictions went into effect on Feb. 2.
The ad suggests that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden used the term “xenophobia” in connection with the president’s travel restrictions. But it’s not clear that he did.
On the day the China restrictions were announced, as we have written, Biden did say at a campaign event in Iowa, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.” But Biden didn’t refer to the travel restrictions in his speech, and the Biden campaign says the candidate was referring to Trump’s penchant for scapegoating, not the travel rules. 
On April 3, the Biden campaign said that he supported the restrictions. 
The ad also suggests that “President Trump saved countless lives” as a result of the travel restrictions. As we have written, in at least two coronavirus task force briefings, the president, without evidence, claimed that the travel restrictions he implemented on China “saved tens of thousands” and even “hundreds of thousands of lives.” We found no support for such figures, and the White House didn’t provide any.
The few studies that have been done estimate travel restrictions the United States and other countries enacted on China had a modest impact, slowing the initial spread outside of China but not containing the coronavirus pandemic.
We have written on a number of occasions about the problems slowing down the nation’s coronavirus testing efforts. The first case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the U.S. was confirmed on Jan. 20.
In the early stages of the pandemic, testing was in the hands of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Problems arose after Feb. 5, when the CDC began shipping its kits out to qualified state and local public health labs in an effort to expand testing. The agency said it was releasing 200 kits — each capable of testing around 700 to 800 specimens — giving labs just one kit each. But by Feb. 12, the CDC told reporters that some labs had experienced problems when doing verification tests to make sure the tests worked.
For a while, the agency promised to remake the faulty component and distribute that to the public health labs and, in the meantime, asked any lab that had difficulties to send samples into the CDC for testing. As a result, as of Feb. 25, only 12 state or local labs out of more than 100 nationwide could do their own testing.
More than two weeks after first announcing the testing issue, the CDC said it had come up with a fix.
Another problem early on stemmed from the criteria the CDC used to determine who would be tested. At first, the CDC recommended testing only those with a fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms, and who had traveled to Wuhan, China, where the disease started, or had contact with someone suspected of having the disease.
In late February, after a patient in California was found to be infected despite a lack of known exposure, the CDC changed its guidelines to include anyone with a fever who was hospitalized with a respiratory illness. On March 3, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the CDC would lift all restrictions, as long as a doctor ordered the test. The CDC updated its clinical criteria web page the next day, stating that clinicians “should use their judgment” in deciding who should be tested.
Another problem stemmed from the CDC’s role early on as the sole player in the testing game.
As we have written, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and several former officials said that the CDC simply isn’t set up to be a commercial test lab, let alone the only test lab for the country in such a pandemic. It was a month after the Trump administration on Jan. 31 declared a public health emergency that it took steps to allow testing to be conducted more broadly, and then several days more before the private sector announced testing availability. 
Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration, wrote, “A series of errors with lab testing delayed the U.S. response to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Besides the CDC test kit problems, he wrote, “the Food and Drug Administration was slow to allow hospital labs to develop their own tests; and the Department of Health and Human Services didn’t work with commercial labs to start developing broadly available private sector tests until far too late.”
On March 6, six weeks after the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the U.S., Trump famously declared that anyone who “wants a test can get a test.” Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a television interview the same day that there “is no testing kit shortage, nor has there ever been.”
But that wasn’t the case. On March 9, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories that although things were improving, “demand for testing is greater than the tests available.”
On March 12, at a congressional hearing, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asked who was in charge of “making sure … as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible.” Fauci responded, “The system — the system does not — is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. … The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.”
So seven weeks after the first case of COVID-19 surfaced in the U.S., there remained a “failing” in the nation’s testing system — contrary to the ad’s claim of “fast action.”",Rem Rieder,2020-05-08 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"On March 9, we were told by the Association of Public Health Laboratories that although things were improving, “demand for testing is greater than the tests available.”

277,Hospital Payments and the COVID-19 Death Count,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/hospital-payments-and-the-covid-19-death-count/,,"1Q: Are hospitals inflating the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more?
A: Recent legislation pays hospitals higher Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients and treatment, but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting.

FULL QUESTION
Are hospitals getting 13,000 per patient if they write that on the diagnosis is COVID19 on the patient’s chart, and 35,000 for each patient if they are on ventilators?
I keep seeing posts in social media claiming that hospitals are over-stating covid-19 deaths because the they are paid more for these deaths … The YouTube video link here is attributed to Fox News with the headline “US: Hospitals Get Paid More to List Patients as COVID-19…” Can you provide any clarification?


FULL ANSWER
A Minnesota state senator’s recent interview on Fox News about Medicare payments for COVID-19 hospitalizations has generated a frenzy of headlines on social media suggesting that hospitals may have a financial motivation when it comes to classifying cases or deaths as related to COVID-19.
One website ran a story headlined, “US Hospitals Getting Paid More to Label Cause of Death as ‘Coronavirus.'” It called the information “disturbing” and the interview “bone-chilling.”
Numerous readers have asked us about such claims, some of which imply that hospitals are making money by simply listing patients as having the disease — when in fact the payments referenced are for treating patients. And while some of the posts imply that fraud may be afoot, multiple experts told us that such theories of hospitals deliberately miscoding patients as COVID-19 are not supported by any evidence. 
The initial comment was made by Minnesota State Sen. Scott Jensen, a family physician, who spoke with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on April 8 about the idea that the number of COVID-19 deaths may be inflated. Jensen was responding to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, who — while answering a reporter’s question about that theory — said “you will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises. They are nothing but distractions.”
Jensen, April 8: I would remind him that anytime health care intersects with dollars it gets awkward. Right now Medicare has determined that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital, you’ll get paid $13,000. If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much. Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do.
In an interview with FactCheck.org, however, Jensen said he did not think that hospitals were intentionally misclassifying cases for financial reasons.
But that’s how his comments have been widely interpreted and paraded on social media. One YouTube video with Jensen’s interview, viewed 42,000 times, was titled “US: Hospitals Get Paid More to List Patients as COVID-19…” That video was then posted in a Facebook group called “X22 Report [Geopolitical]” with a caption referencing the specific dollar amounts that read in part: “This also explains the inflated amount of covid deaths.” Nearly 3,000 users shared the video from that post.
“So, hospitals get an extra $13,000 if they diagnose a death as COVID-19,” a widely shared meme on Facebook claimed. “And an additional $39,000 if they use a ventilator!” One post of the meme, shared by hundreds, was captioned: “And then we wonder why the numbers of deaths are embellished…”
The figures cited by Jensen generally square with estimated Medicare payments for COVID-19 hospitalizations, based on average Medicare payments for patients with similar diagnoses.
Medicare — the federal health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, a central at-risk population when it comes to COVID-19 — pays hospitals in part using fixed rates at discharge based off a grouping system known as diagnosis-related groups.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has classified COVID-19 cases with existing groups for respiratory infections and inflammations. A CMS spokesperson told us exact payments vary, depending on a patient’s principal diagnosis and severity, as well as treatments and procedures. There are also geographic variations.
An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation looked at average Medicare payments for hospital admissions for the existing diagnosis-related groups and noted that the “average Medicare payment for respiratory infections and inflammations with major comorbidities or complications in 2017 … was $13,297. For more severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support for greater than 96 hours, which was $40,218.”
It is true, however, that the government will pay more to hospitals for COVID-19 cases in two senses: By paying an additional 20% on top of traditional Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients during the public health emergency, and by reimbursing hospitals for treating the uninsured patients with the disease (at that enhanced Medicare rate).
Both of those provisions stem from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act.
The CARES Act created the 20% add-on to be paid for Medicare patients with COVID-19. The act further created a $100 billion fund that is being used to financially assist hospitals — a “portion” of which will be “used to reimburse healthcare providers, at Medicare rates, for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured,” according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
As the Kaiser analysis noted, though, “it is unclear whether the new fund will be able to cover the costs of the uninsured in addition to other needs, such as the purchase of medical supplies and the construction of temporary facilities.”
Either way, the fact that government programs are paying hospitals for treating patients who have COVID-19 isn’t on its own representative of anything nefarious.
“There’s an implication here that hospitals are over-reporting their COVID patients because they have an economic advantage of doing so, [which] is really an outrageous claim,” Gerald Kominski, senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told us. And, he said, any suggestion that patients may be put on ventilators out of financial gain, not medical need, “is basically saying physicians are violating their Hippocratic Oath … it would be like providing heart surgery on someone who doesn’t need it.”
Robert Berenson, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute, said the notion that hospitals are profiting off the pandemic — as some of the social media posts may imply — isn’t borne out by facts, either.
Berenson said revenues appear to be down for hospitals this quarter because many have suspended elective procedures, which are key to their revenue, forcing some hospitals to cut staff. He surmised that potential instances of patients being wrongly “upcoded” — or classified as COVID-19 when they’re not — are “trivial compared to these other forces that are affecting hospital finances.”
Berenson and others we spoke with also said that hospitals have profound disincentives for “upcoding,” which can result in criminal or civil liabilities, such as being susceptible to being kicked out of the Medicare program.
Jensen himself said in a phone interview that he was not alleging widespread medical fraud.
“Do I think people are misclassifying? No,” Jensen said. He said his concerns centered on what he deemed “less precise standards” for certifying deaths promulgated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and how deaths classified as COVID-19 without corroborating positive test results could lead to an over-counting.
The CDC guidance says that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.'”
“If we think it’s presumptive … we can go ahead and put down COVID-19,” Jensen said, “or even in some situations, even if it’s negative.” He pointed to the example of a 38-year-old man in Minnesota whose death was attributed to the coronavirus even though he tested negative.
The man’s mother, however, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that doctors determined the test result was likely a false negative. It’s not known exactly how common false negatives are in the U.S., but public health experts and doctors have raised concerns about many instances of tests showing negative results even when all other indicators point to COVID-19.
Fact sheets for different COVID-19 tests from the Food and Drug Administration note that a “negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19. When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false negative result should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The possibility of a false negative result should especially be considered if the patient’s recent exposures or clinical presentation indicate that COVID-19 is likely, and diagnostic tests for other causes of illness (e.g., other respiratory illness) are negative.”
As for the accuracy of the death toll, other experts have previously  told us that while it’s true that some deaths attributed to COVID-19 likely would have occurred regardless of the disease, other factors — like the deaths of undiagnosed COVID-19 victims, including those that occur at home — contribute to a more significant problem of under-counting the deaths. 
New York City recently added more than 3,700 victims to its death toll to account for presumed cases. The CDC’s national count now makes note of how many cases and deaths were deemed “probable.” 
Jensen said he actually believed there could be both instances of under-counting and over-counting of COVID-19 cases and deaths — but said that “if there’s an over-count it’s conceivable that that could down the road translate to increased dollars in terms of some of the recovery dollars from COVID-19.”
When it comes to the $100 billion fund to help providers, future grants by HHS are supposed to focus on providers in areas hit hard by the outbreak, among others. But the initial allocation of $30 billion from that $100 billion fund to assist hospitals wasn’t distributed in that way. Instead, it was based on prior Medicare business.
A Kaiser Health News analysis found that the distribution of that initial $30 billion resulted in hospitals in states less affected by the pandemic — such as Minnesota, Nebraska and Montana — being given funding that worked out to be about “$300,000 per reported COVID-19 case.” In New York, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, the grant money amounted to “only $12,000 per case.”

Robert Berenson, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute, said the notion that hospitals are profiting off the pandemic — as some of the social media posts may imply — isn’t borne out by facts, either. The CDC guidance says that officials should report deaths in which the patient tested positive for COVID-19 — or, if a test isn’t available, “if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.” It further indicates that if a “definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed. The possibility of a false negative result should especially be considered if the patient’s recent exposures or clinical presentation indicate that COVID-19 is likely, and diagnostic tests for other causes of illness (e.g., other respiratory illness) are negative.”
As for the accuracy of the death toll, other experts have previously  told us that while it’s true that some deaths attributed to COVID-19 likely would have occurred regardless of the disease, other factors — like the deaths of undiagnosed COVID-19 victims, including those that occur at home — contribute to a more significant problem of under-counting the deaths. For more severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support for greater than 96 hours, which was $40,218.”
It is true, however, that the government will pay more to hospitals for COVID-19 cases in two senses: By paying an additional 20% on top of traditional Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients during the public health emergency, and by reimbursing hospitals for treating the uninsured patients with the disease (at that enhanced Medicare rate). A Kaiser Health News analysis found that the distribution of that initial $30 billion resulted in hospitals in states less affected by the pandemic — such as Minnesota, Nebraska and Montana — being given funding that worked out to be about “$300,000 per reported COVID-19 case.” In New York, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, the grant money amounted to “only $12,000 per case.”

278,Trump Spreads Distorted Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/trump-spreads-distorted-claim-on-wuhan-lab-funding/,,"3The Wuhan Institute of Virology received $600,000 as part of a larger five-year U.S. government grant to a U.S.-based nonprofit studying emerging infectious diseases. But President Donald Trump put the figure at $7.5 million, saying he “ended it.”
We asked the White House where the $7.5 million figure may have come from, but we haven’t received a response.
False claims that the Wuhan lab had received $3.7 million in National Institutes of Health grant money have circulated online after an April 11 Daily Mail story made that assertion and Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz repeated it in a Fox News interview. The NIH didn’t award such a grant. Instead, it gave a grant totaling $3.4 million, beginning in 2014, to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats. And EcoHealth distributed $600,000 of that total to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a collaborator on the project, pre-approved by NIH.
We wrote about this distortion of the EcoHealth grant after the claim appeared in the conspiracy theory video “Plandemic.”
Trump echoed the claim in an interview that aired May 14 on Fox Business News. Host Maria Bartiromo asked of the Wuhan institute, “Didn’t we as a country give money to that lab?” Trump responded:
Trump, May 14: Yeah. As I understand it, before I got here, $7.5 million in 2014. And look, they said they were studying different things and you know, things like that happen. But, you know, money was given by the Obama administration early on. … I ended it. … I took a lot of heat too. They said, “Oh, we’re studying all sorts of stuff.” You saw what happened. I ended it.
It’s unclear what other funding the president may be including in his figure. An April 16 Fox News story cited another $3.4 million grant, regarding a behavioral study, that may have included some funding that went to the Wuhan lab. But the grant, which was awarded to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, hasn’t been terminated. It was originally for 2014-2019 and a second related grant was approved this year. We reached out to Cold Spring Harbor Lab, and we’ll update this story if we receive additional information.
Fox News acknowledged that it was “not clear exactly how much U.S. funding went directly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the American grants.”
Update, June 18: When we revisited this issue for another story, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory told us no money from its grant went to the Wuhan lab. “[B]ased on CSHL’s records for its NIH R01 award MH101214, there is nothing to indicate that any money from this grant was provided to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Dagnia Zeidlickis, the lab’s vice president of communications, told us in an email.
In the case of the EcoHealth grant — the one that was canceled — we do know how much went to the Wuhan lab and it was well short of even $1 million.
In a statement, the NIH said the total grant to EcoHealth was $3.4 million over six years (2014 through 2019) and that the grant had been terminated. “NIH does not discuss details of the decision making process regarding specific grant awards,” the statement said. Information on the NIH website shows the project began on June 1, 2014, and was ended on April 24, 2020.
Nearly all of the $3.4 million was part of a five-year grant awarded in 2014, EcoHealth spokesman Robert Kessler told us in an email, and the $600,000 given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology was part of that grant. In 2019, the project was renewed for another five years, and EcoHealth received $292,161 in 2019 before NIH canceled the grant last month.
USA Today reported that about $76,000 had been budgeted for the Wuhan lab as part of the 2019 renewal. Kessler confirmed to us that money had been budgeted but it hadn’t been distributed to the lab before the grant was ended.
The Wuhan, China, lab — located in the city where the novel coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019 — was pre-approved as a collaborator by NIH and the State Department, Kessler said. Researchers used the lab to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses.
“In each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work, we collaborate with local institutions, all of which are pre-approved by our federal funders,” EcoHealth said in an April 28 statement about the terminated funding. “It’s been EcoHealth Alliance’s position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety. That seems clearer now than ever before.”
The NIH grant — technically funded through the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — backed research into the emergence of coronaviruses that can affect humans and originate in bats, which is the origin, experts suspect, of SARS-CoV-2, or the novel coronavirus, as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which caused a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, identified in 2012.
The EcoHealth project description on the NIH website says that zoonotic coronaviruses — meaning those that can transfer from animals to humans — “are a significant threat to global health” and that bats “appear to be the natural reservoir of these viruses.” The project “aims to understand what factors increase the risk of the next CoV emerging in people by studying CoV diversity in a critical zoonotic reservoir (Bats), at sites of high risk for emergence (wildlife markets) in an emerging disease hotspot (China).”
EcoHealth, which has received government grant money nearly every year since 2002, according to an NIH database, said in its April 28 statement that the research terminated by the Trump administration “aimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. In fact, genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug Remdesivir.”
Clinical trials are underway to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization on May 1 for the drug based on early results.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been the subject of baseless conspiracy theories claiming SARS-CoV-2 was created or manipulated in a lab. As we’ve written, the authors of a March article in Nature Medicine concluded: “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”
University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of SARS-CoV-2, also said in an April statement: “Coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts. This is also the most likely explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.”
Responding to what he called “unfounded speculation” that a bat coronavirus named RaTG13, being kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was the origin, Holmes said that for various reasons he concluded: “SARS-CoV-2 was not derived from RaTG13.” Holmes said more sampling of other animals “is needed to resolve the exact origins” of the novel coronavirus.
The U.S. Intelligence Community said in an April 30 statement that it “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,” and that it “will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”
In remarks the same day, Trump answered, “Yes, I have,” when asked if he had “seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus.” But the president also said: “We’re going to see where it comes from. And you know — look, you know every theory, whether you had the theory from the lab, you had the theory from many different — the bats, and the type of bat, and the bat is 40 miles away, so it couldn’t have been here and it couldn’t have been there. And we have a — there’s a lot of theories. But, yeah, we have people looking at it very, very strongly.”
Investigations into the origin of the virus aside, Trump was wrong to claim the U.S. government has given $7.5 million to the Wuhan lab under his predecessor. The lab received only $600,000 through a five-year grant to EcoHealth Alliance, a grant that spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations and had been renewed last year. We don’t know how much, if anything, the lab may have received as part of other grants.
Update, May 21, 2021: The exact origin of the coronavirus remains unknown. On May 14 the journal Science published a letter from 18 scientists calling for “more investigation” to determine how the pandemic began. “Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable,” they wrote. “Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.”

279,"Video Targets Gates With Old Clip, Misleading Edit",https://www.factcheck.org/2021/03/scicheck-video-targets-gates-with-old-clip-misleading-edit/,,"SciCheck Digest
In a 2010 TED Talk focused on developing new technologies to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Bill Gates briefly mentioned reducing the rate of population growth. A conspiratorial video circulating on Facebook misleadingly edits Gates’ talk to suggest his “wish” was to depopulate the planet through vaccines.

Full Story
A Facebook video viewed more than 100,000 times is using a deceptively edited clip of Bill Gates to accuse the Microsoft co-founder of advocating for a nefarious plan to depopulate the world through vaccines.
The video — captioned, “Take a look at this #DepopulationAgenda” — employs a computer-generated voiceover that suggests Gates and other high-profile philanthropists want to remove some portion of the global population. The same video was uploaded to YouTube in April 2020, as misinformation relating to Gates swirled on social media.

The Facebook version includes ominous music and is presented as a meme, adding an apocalyptic image of a syringe in front of a pile of skulls to further imply a deadly plan is afoot. The narration tells viewers it will use quotes directly from “Bill Gates himself so that later no one will accuse me of allegedly distorting his words.” But then it does just that. 
The video misleadingly edits Gates’ 2010 TED Talk — “Innovating to zero!” — which focused on the need to zero out carbon dioxide emissions through new approaches to energy production in order to fight climate change. Ignoring Gates’ theme of energy innovation, the video misleadingly portrays the speech as evidence of a purported “depopulation” agenda that involves COVID-19 and the global vaccination efforts of Gates, the World Health Organization and pharmaceutical companies.
Before showing parts of Gates’ 2010 talk, the video presents part of a 2009 story in the Guardian that reported that Gates and other billionaire philanthropists had met and discussed overpopulation as a serious issue facing the world. But that was only one topic discussed. The video ignores that the group reportedly discussed a range of other issues, too — including education, government reform and the economic crisis at that time.
It’s also worth noting — since the Facebook video doesn’t — that the same Guardian story also reported that a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation vaccination project — Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance — was estimated at the time “to have prevented 3.4 million deaths in just eight years.”
After its selective use of the Guardian article, the video then goes on to show a clip from Gates’ 2010 TED Talk as he was discussing the amount of carbon dioxide produced each year around the world.
Bill Gates, “Innovating to zero!”: …over 26 billion tons. For each American, it’s about 20 tons. For people in poor countries, it’s less than one ton. It’s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It’s been constantly going up. It’s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero.
This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication. So you’ve got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that’s going to be based on the number of people, the services each person is using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. So let’s look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
That’s back from high school algebra. But let’s take a look.
First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.
That portion of Gates’ talk has spawned a false narrative that has persisted over the years that argues Gates was calling for the killing of millions of people by using vaccines — a narrative that the Facebook video again revisits.
It’s clear, however, that Gates was referring once again to his belief that improving health and reducing child deaths, including through vaccines, can have the effect of limiting future population growth — which he has talked about many other times.
In 2012, he again spoke about the need in underdeveloped countries to provide family planning services and better health care to decrease child mortality in order to deal with overpopulation. Similarly, in 2018, Melinda Gates, his wife and co-founder of the couple’s foundation, said: “When more children live past the age of 5, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood.”
Bill Gates went on in his full, unedited TED Talk to spend most of his time focusing on the need to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions through innovation in energy production. For example, he spoke about one venture he backs that aims to create more efficient nuclear energy by using the waste created by current nuclear reactors.
But the video on Facebook cuts all of that — nearly 13 minutes in total — and moves directly from Gates briefly referencing the prospect of limiting population growth rate to his saying it’s his “wish” for such a technology. It provides no context for viewers to understand what hoped-for technology he was referencing.
The edited video picks up his talk here:
Bill Gates, “Innovating to zero!”: So this is a wish. It’s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years — I could pick who’s president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that’s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented — this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don’t get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the US and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all, the lives of those two billion will be far worse.
“So what have we heard from Bill?” the video voiceover says. “Global warming — which is supposedly caused by anthropogenic carbon emission — and to reset it, you need to slightly reduce the world’s population.”
As we said, Gates briefly suggested that health care and vaccines could reduce the rate at which the population grows — but he didn’t propose killing off humans, as the video implies. His focus in the Ted Talk was on reducing carbon dioxide emissions by transforming the energy sector — something this misleading video leaves on the cutting-room floor.
The full TED Talk can be seen here:

The Facebook video continues by showing a 2011 clip of Gates speaking with CNN’s Sanjay Gupta about his pledge to spend $10 billion over a decade on vaccination efforts. He said in the interview that by reducing the number of children who die every year through vaccines, “the benefits there are in terms of reducing sickness, reducing the population growth, it really allows society a chance to take care of itself.”
The video presents a loop of Gates saying the words, “reducing the population growth,” and then asks: “Amazing, isn’t it?”
Except, as we said, Gates has been transparent about his belief that improved health and vaccines could reduce population growth.
The video concludes by sowing doubt about the global response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
It presents a lengthy video clip of Gates in 2015 discussing the need for pandemic preparedness — followed by details of Gates’ significant contributions to WHO and his foundation’s participation in a 2019 preparedness exercise involving a coronavirus — to baselessly insinuate that Gates, WHO and the pharmaceutical industry are behind a global effort to kill people.
As we’ve explained before, such preparedness exercises have been held for many years. And some experts had warned of the potential for coronaviruses (which are a family of viruses) to trigger a pandemic at least 20 years before the 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
But the video ignores all of that context, instead feeding viewers a narrative that is heavy on innuendo and lacking in evidence.

280,Coronavirus Hasn’t Contaminated Crab Legs,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/coronavirus-hasnt-contaminated-crab-legs/,,"Quick Take
A viral post disguised as a TV news report falsely claims that crab legs have been contaminated with the novel coronavirus. The pandemic has affected the flow of seafood from foreign markets, but crab is safe to eat.

Full Story
A viral Facebook post falsely claims that crab legs have been found to be contaminated with the coronavirus. The meme, which has been circulating on social media as a “screenshot” of television news, actually comes from a bogus news-generating app. The original post has since been deleted, but the meme and its misinformation have continued to circulate.
The news “screenshot” shows an image of crab legs behind the “BREAKING NEWS” headline: “CORONA VIRUS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CRAB LEG.” The news chyron (the text on the lower portion of the image) also declares that “The Virus Has Now Been Found in Crab Lega Studies Say.”
As the website Lead Stories found, the “screenshot” is actually the product of an app called News Maker. The app allows users to generate “your own realistic, television-style news screenshots using your own photos and your own creative headlines.” We checked and matched the visual components of the screenshot image, such as the “6 News” logo, blue background, and chyron style, to the app.
The chyron’s text contains typos and grammatical errors, suggesting it wasn’t made by a media outlet. For example, legs are spelled “lega,” and “corona virus” is incorrectly spelled as two words.
Furthermore, the claim that crab has been found to be contaminated with the coronavirus is unfounded. A February press release from the Food and Drug Administration states, “Again, we want to reassure the public that at this time there is no evidence that food or food packaging have been associated with transmission [of coronavirus] and no reason to be concerned.”
In a Q&A article on COVID-19, the World Health Organization states that “[t]he likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.”
The WHO also advises that “when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.”
These are normal seafood safety precautions, Forbes reports. Recent travel advisories have led the FDA to announce that it is “postponing most foreign inspections through April, effective immediately” while maintaining “oversight over international manufacturers and imported products using alternative tools and methods … which have proved effective in the past.”
That’s not to say that the coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions will not affect seafood supply chains. Import restrictions and a lockdown on domestic travel in Italy, France and Spain have caused seafood suppliers to shut down due to the lack of foreign demand. Forbes reports that many people are opting to order frozen and processed seafood products online instead of getting fresh products at markets, citing this article on the Chinese seafood market.
Regardless of how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the global seafood supply chain, crab legs — and seafood products — have not been found to be contaminated with the virus.

281,DeVos’ Outdated Statistic on School Efforts,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/devos-outdated-statistic-on-school-efforts/,,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos used an outdated figure in claiming only 10% of school districts had “provided any kind of real curriculum and instruction program” after the coronavirus pandemic caused schools to shut down this spring. That was the case for 82 districts in late March, but by late April, 56% were doing so. In late May, the figure was 67%.
Those figures, from the Center on Reinventing Public Education, reflect the percentage of the 82 districts that provided formal curriculum and instruction.
Those districts, however, weren’t a nationally representative sample. Another analysis, conducted by the same organization and published in June, did include a statistically representative sample of U.S. school districts. It found, using publicly available information, that 33.5% expected all teachers to provide remote instruction, and another 13.2% expected some teachers to do so.
The Center on Reinventing Public Education, housed at the University of Washington Bothell, says it is “a nonpartisan research center open to all possible solutions to measurably improve outcomes for all students.” It says “parent choice is essential but not magic.”
DeVos made the claim during a July 8 coronavirus task force briefing in which she spoke about reopening schools this fall.
DeVos, July 8: There were a number of schools and districts across the country that did an awesome job of transitioning this spring. And there were a lot in which I and state school leaders were disappointed in that they didn’t figure out how to continue to serve their students. Too many of them just gave up. The Center for Reinventing Public Education said that only 10% across the board provided any kind of real curriculum and instruction program.
Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, did say that, as quoted in a March 31 article in U.S. News & World Report. That was shortly after 18 states, plus Washington, D.C., had ordered schools to close and another four recommended it on March 16, according to Education Week. In the days that followed, most other states ordered or recommended closures as well.
U.S. News & World Report, March 31: “Not many yet are providing what you’d consider a real coherent educational program,” says Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, where researchers compiled a database of how teachers and district leaders in 82 school districts that serve more than 9 million children are trying to salvage the school year.
“Only 10% across the board are providing any kind of real curriculum and instruction program, which is a little alarming given most of the experts are projecting we’re going to be in this mess for quite some time,” she says. “I don’t mean to pass judgement here. This is a hard, hard problem, but clearly we’re seeing a lot of variation.”
While not a representative sample of the entire country, the database does include dozens of the biggest school districts in the U.S., including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami-Dade and more.
Lake based that comment on the results of an analysis of 82 mostly large school districts in urban areas. For the week of March 26, the center found 5% of those districts provided curriculum and instruction and another 5% provided curriculum, instruction and progress monitoring. That’s the source of Lake’s 10% figure, CRPE told FactCheck.org.
But as the chart below from CRPE shows, the number “rapidly improved since late March,” Travis Pillow, the editorial director and a spokesman for CRPE, said in an email to us. “By the end of the spring, the majority of the districts in our analysis were delivering curriculum, instruction and progress monitoring.”


 
The center’s chart shows that in the week of April 21, 12% of the districts were providing curriculum, instruction and no progress monitoring and 44% were providing all three. That means Lake’s 10% figure at the end of March rose to 56% by late April.
In an April 27 blog post on the center’s analysis, Lake and Bree Dusseault, practitioner-in-residence at the center, wrote: “Districts have come a long way” since the school closures began.
They noted, and the chart shows, that all districts were providing educational resources and nearly all were at least providing formal curriculum (even though 41% of the districts CRPE reviewed didn’t also provide instruction).
Pillow explained that some districts created packets of materials or online lessons for students but they didn’t expect teachers to provide instruction, either through the phone, live video or recorded lectures. “We were trying to determine whether districts were communicating an expectation that all three pieces of what education wonks call the ‘instructional core’ (students, teachers, content) would remain connected—that teachers were expected to help students make sense of the material,” he said. Teachers “might have been checking in with students or hosting social assemblies via Zoom, but when it came to teaching and learning, students and families were expected to be largely on their own with paper packets or online activities.”
By May 22, the percentage of the districts providing curriculum, instruction and progress monitoring had increased further — to 61%. Another 6% provided only curriculum and instruction, and 32% of those districts were at least providing formal curriculum.
However, since the 82-district analysis wasn’t a representative sample, CRPE conducted another analysis – of 477 districts, using statistical weighting to produce a nationally representative sample. That analysis, which relied on publicly available information, such as school districts’ websites and social media postings, “reveals a more sobering story,” CRPE said in a June report. It found 33.5% of districts expected all teachers to provide remote instruction this spring. Another 13.2% of districts expected some teachers to do so, such as only high school teachers.
The data was collected over a month — from April 6 to May 1, with some updates for missing information made during the week of May 4. The report notes that “these accounts should be considered a conservative take on districts’ responses,” since a small number — 14 districts — didn’t have any information about school closures on their websites or social media accounts and “some” offered limited information but clearly directly communicated with parents via other means.
In the sample, 85% of districts provided something – either curriculum packets, assignments posted in an online platform or guidance on using online learning software — and 57.9% expected teachers to monitor students’ progress or provide feedback for all or some of their students.
Pillow noted that setting an expectation isn’t the same as what actually happened with instruction: “We know there were schools and teachers in districts like Newark, NJ, that delivered instruction this spring even though their districts did not set that expectation,” he said. “On the other hand, we know there were places where instruction may have been expected, but large numbers of students were disconnected from school or not receiving instruction due to a lack of broadband or other challenges.”
So, while DeVos’ 10% figure later rose to 56% and then 67%, the better sample conservatively shows about one-third of school districts in the country expected all of their teachers to teach remotely. And another 13.2% expected some of their teachers to do so. We asked the Department of Education’s press office for comment on DeVos’ use of an outdated statistic, but we haven’t received a response.
Update, July 17: We received a response from the Education Department. Press Secretary Angela Morabito said in a statement: “The Secretary was recounting a study she had seen, which you have verified was accurate. It’s certainly a good thing that CRPE’s newest data shows more districts started to provide curriculum and instruction, but the fact remains that even at the end of April too many students still didn’t have access to education.”

282,"Coronavirus Prank Falsely Tells of Workplace, School Closings",https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/coronavirus-prank-falsely-tells-of-workplace-school-closings/,,"1.1KQuick Take
Facebook posts, evidently intended as a prank, erroneously claim that the government — or specific states such as Michigan or Florida — has mandated that employers and schools close for two weeks in response to the coronavirus. No such announcement has been made.


Full Story 
Complete with “BREAKING NEWS” graphics, viral Facebook text posts are spreading a falsehood about a government mandate requiring workplaces and schools to close in order to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The posts are apparently intended to be part of a joke, though users have to click the link at the bottom to get the punchline.
“The Government have announced measures that all workplaces with 10 employees or more are to have paid mandatory leave to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus starting from March 6, 2020,” the posts read. “All schools are to close for 2 weeks also from March 6th … Offices will resume after 2 weeks of the mandatory closure. A list of all schools and businesses in your area is shown on the list.”
The link to the “full article” included in the post, however, is actually a link for a photo of a gorilla giving the middle finger.
A different iteration of the same claim attributed the announcement to CNN and listed the start date of the closings as March 9. Others switched out the vague “government” reference to make the claim specific to Michigan, Florida, Alabama and other states.
Some commenters expressed an understanding of the joke, but the viral posts — amid a steady flow of coronavirus-related misinformation — nevertheless stand to mislead Facebook users as the U.S. grapples with the coronavirus.
We could find no evidence of the federal government or any state announcing any such requirements thus far. Some schools — including in Washington, Oregon and Rhode Island — were prompted to temporarily close due to the coronavirus, but not because of statewide mandates. And the U.S. Department of Education’s current interim guidance for schools does not call for mandatory two-week closings; it encourages schools to make decisions with local officials, noting that dismissals “may be recommended for 14 days, or possibly longer if advised by local health officials.”
At least some of the states referenced in the posts, including Michigan and Alabama, had no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus as of March 5, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — though that could change as the outbreak unfolds.
Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that there is “not a recommendation in Michigan that schools or businesses close at this time.” She added that the state’s information and recommendations regarding the virus can be found at michigan.gov/coronavirus.
Many states, including Alabama and Florida, have set up similar pages for state-specific information related to the new coronavirus.

283,Video: FactChecking the Final Debate,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/video-factchecking-the-final-debate/,,"In this video, we review several false and misleading claims that President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden made at the final presidential debate on Oct. 22. 

Here are the claims that we cover in the video:

Trump accused Biden of receiving “$3.5 million from Russia.” There’s no evidence of that.
Biden claimed Social Security’s chief actuary said if Trump “continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security” the program “will be bankrupt by 2023.” Trump hasn’t proposed ending the tax without providing alternative funding, the scenario the actuary assessed.
Trump misleadingly suggested the Obama administration was to blame for his administration’s policy that caused the separation of immigrant families.
Biden wrongly said “the president’s own advisers have told him” that the use of face masks can save an estimated 100,000 U.S. lives over the remainder of this year. That estimate, which has since been revised down to 34,000, came from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation — not the administration.
The president falsely claimed that “less than 1%” of those caught crossing the border and released pending immigration hearings appear in court. The rate is about 50%, according to his own Justice Department. Immigration experts say it is even higher than that. 
Trump also falsely claimed murderers and rapists are released under a so-called “catch and release” policy. In fact, immigration laws require such criminals be detained.
Biden misleadingly claimed that “38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison” during the Obama administration. The total number went down by about 12,000.

284,Post Misleads on Japan’s Policy for Donating Blood After COVID-19 Vaccination,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/05/post-misleads-on-japans-policy-for-donating-blood-after-covid-19-vaccination/,,"SciCheck Digest
Japan only recently adopted guidelines for accepting blood donations from those who have received COVID-19 vaccines. The guidelines are intended to give donors time to get over any side effects from the vaccine. Without providing that context, a social media post misleadingly claims Japan is “refusing” blood donations from vaccinated people.

Japan has reported more than 651,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 11,000 deaths, and is in the midst of a fourth wave of infections. Yet it lags far behind many other nations in vaccinating its population against the novel coronavirus.
With just 2% of the population fully inoculated – compared to more than 35% in the U.S. – Japan “is on a par with Myanmar – a failed state,” Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University’s Japan campus, told us in an email.
Late to the game while waiting for a homegrown vaccine that did not materialize, Japan has approved only one vaccine — the Pfizer/BioNTech shot — for the country and has been slow getting it into people’s arms.
“A labyrinthine approval process hasn’t helped,” William Pesek, a Tokyo resident and author of “Japanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan’s Lost Decades,” wrote in the Washington Post. “Tradition-bound Tokyo has long required pharmaceutical companies to do soup-to-nuts clinical trials locally, rather than incorporating studies and data done elsewhere.”
He also noted the relatively low death rate in a nation of 126 million has reduced a sense of urgency, and a “lively” anti-vaccine movement is spreading skepticism in Japan. There have been about 8.75 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in Japan compared with nearly 178 per 100,000 in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
In the midst of this, a post on Facebook has started spreading in the U.S., misleadingly claiming, “JAPAN refuses blood donations from any who received shot/s! Wow… What’s that tell you?!”
But Japan has not been refusing to accept blood donations from vaccinated individuals; it simply put them on hold while the government drew up donor guidelines.
Hitoshi Hatta, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., told FactCheck.org in an email on May 7 that the Health Ministry recently adopted guidelines calling for “people not to donate blood within (only) 48 hours after vaccination for Covid-19.”
He said in a telephone interview that the delay has nothing to do with concerns about the vaccine’s safety, but is intended to give would-be donors time to get over any possible side effects from the vaccine. Side effects can include dizziness, fever and body aches, and would preclude them from giving blood.
The Japanese Red Cross Society posted the government recommendations on April 28, but said it would not put them into effect until May 14.
The guidelines come as Japan is also dealing with a blood shortage due to a drop in donations in the face of pandemic shutdowns.
What impact the slow rollout of the vaccine will have for the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in July is not yet clear. But Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, facing another wave of COVID-19 infections in the country, on May 7 extended the state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures until May 31 and expanded it to Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures.
One thing working in favor of the Olympics going ahead is that, except for athletes and participants, no foreigners can enter the country to attend.
Kingston, of Temple’s Japan campus, told FactCheck.org that the lagging rollout of the vaccine and the delay in the blood donation guidelines are the government’s making.
“It’s a bureaucratic bottleneck driven by fear that something might go wrong, so best to delay and delay,” he said.
Kingston said Japan also has not forgotten a scandal that enraged the nation in the 1980s, after it became known that some government officials allowed continued use of blood contaminated with the HIV virus after it had been established that heat treatments would have prevented the spread of the infection through donated blood. Takeshi Abe, who had led the Health Ministry’s AIDS research team at the time, was charged with attempted murder in 1996 but was acquitted in 2001.
In the U.S., there is no wait time, or deferral as it is known, to donate blood under Food and Drug Administration guidelines for those who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. But the FDA, anticipating the development of live attenuated vaccines — which use a weakened form of the virus to provide protection — has already suggested a two-week deferral for anyone inoculated with any of those vaccines.
According to the World Health Organization, live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines are in pre-clinical development at the University of North Carolina.
Dr. Julie Katz Karp, director of transfusion medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, said the FDA decided early on that there would be no deferral for blood donations for those inoculated with the three authorized vaccines now in use in the U.S.
“They recognized that the risk to the recipient was essentially – as far as we could tell from a scientific perspective – nothing,” she said.
(See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine,” “A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.“)
Karp said the medical directors of blood banks still have it within their own power to require vaccine recipients to delay giving blood if they see fit.
She said deferral periods have two key purposes. One is to protect the donor, and the other to ensure the recipient gets a safe blood product that has “good potency, good purity and good efficacy.”
For example, donors with low hemoglobin counts will get deferrals in the interest of both themselves and a possible recipient, while those with low blood pressure will have to wait for their own safety until they can give blood.
She said deferral periods “vary widely” around the world and are judgments made by local officials based on reasons ranging from medical to cultural to even storage capacity. She said the U.S., where one can give blood every 56 days, tends to be more aggressive, while others are more conservative. For example, in Japan a man can only give blood three times a year, while for women it is twice a year.
And in terms of vaccine-related deferrals, India only recently has reduced its period from 28 days to two weeks at the request of blood banks.
The demand for blood in the U.S. dipped during the pandemic as hospitals put off elective surgeries and accidents ebbed, Karp said, but it is nearing pre-pandemic levels and with it, the need for more donations.

285,Trump’s COVID-19 Testing Claim Is Way Off,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-covid-19-testing-claim-is-way-off/,,"The United States has not done more COVID-19 testing than “every country combined,” as President Donald Trump claimed in remarks during a recent press briefing.
In fact, three countries alone — Russia, Germany and Italy — have done more combined testing than the U.S., according to a reference website tracking global testing for the disease.
The president most recently made the false statement at an April 28 White House event highlighting the federal Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. But he has been making a version of the claim for more than a week. (We’re not the first to point out he’s wrong.)
Trump, April 28: We are way ahead on testing. We are the best in the world on testing. We’ve tested much more than anybody else, times two — or every country combined. We’ve tested more than every country combined.
As of the afternoon of April 29, the U.S had done almost 6.03 million tests for the disease, according to data collected by Worldometer, a widely cited data aggregation website. (The website’s “about” page says it is run by an “international team of developers, researchers, and volunteers” and “published by a small and independent digital media company based in the United States.”)
The U.S. total is indeed more than any single country has reportedly done — but not more than all other countries combined.
Adding together just the number of tests conducted by Russia, Germany and Italy — the next three countries that have done the most testing — would produce a higher figure (about 7.29 million) than the U.S. total. And, overall, there have been nearly 25 million tests performed by the 172 non-U.S. countries for which Worldometer has data.
So, Trump’s claim is not even close to being accurate.
We would also note — as we have before — that the U.S. trails many countries in terms of testing on a per-capita basis, according to multiple sources.
Worldometer, for example, shows the U.S. doing 18,216 tests per 1 million people, as of April 29. But that was a lower figure than those of 41 other countries.
That is something else to consider when the president boasts that the U.S. — which is the third most populous country — has done a lot more testing than any other nation.

286,Democratic Ad Twists Trump’s ‘Hoax’ Comment,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/democratic-ad-twists-trumps-hoax-comment/,,"The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action has been running an ad falsely suggesting President Donald Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a “hoax.”
At the beginning, the ad splices together two quotes to have Trump saying, “The coronavirus, this is their new hoax.” It is obvious in listening to the ad that he said, “The coronavirus,” and, “this is their new hoax,” at different times. His voice sounds quite different in the two segments.
But on the screen, “The coronavirus, this is their new hoax” appears as a single sentence.
Trump did use the word “hoax” but his full comments, and subsequent explanation, make clear he was talking about Democratic attacks on his administration’s handling of the outbreak, not the virus itself.

On April 13, the Trump campaign sued WJFW-NBC of Rhinelander, Wisconsin, for defamation for running the ad, which has been running in some version in swing states almost continually since March 24, according to Advertising Analytics, at a cost so far of about $2.5 million.
A 15-second version of the ad also appears online as part of a digital ad campaign.
After Priorities USA Action launched its $6 million ad campaign on television stations in the swing states of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in late March, the Trump campaign warned the stations not to run the ads to “avoid costly and time consuming litigation.”
In addition to the misleading “hoax” segment, the ad features a series of statements in which Trump downplayed the risk of the coronavirus outbreak. These quotes are accurate.
As we have reported, the “hoax” kerfuffle began at a Trump rally in South Carolina on Feb. 28. At one point Trump said, “And this is their new hoax.” But he did so in the context of assailing Democrats for trying to politicize what the Democrats saw as his administration’s shortcomings in combating the crisis.
Trump, Feb. 28: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, “How’s President Trump doing?” They go, “Oh, not good, not good.” They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes.
One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.
The president, who often dismissed special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and his impeachment as hoaxes, portrayed the Democrats’ criticism of his coronavirus policy as a continuation of a campaign to bring him down. Later in the rally, he referred to the coronavirus criticism as the Democrats’ “single talking point.”
“A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right? It’s Donald Trump’s fault,” he said. “No, just things that happened.”
Democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on Trump’s “hoax” remark. Former Vice President Joe Biden described the president’s comments as “absolutely bizarre.”
The following day, at a press conference, Trump reiterated that he used the term “hoax” in connection to the Democrats’ attacks.
Reporter, Feb. 29: You were down in Charleston last night, using the word “hoax” when talking about Democrats. Somebody now is dead from this. Do you regret that kind of talk?
Trump: No, no, no. “Hoax” referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not — I’m not talking about what’s happening here; I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the “Russia, Russia, Russia” hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.
But the way they refer to it — because these people have done such an incredible job, and I don’t like it when they are criticizing these people. And that’s the hoax. That’s what I’m talking about.
The rest of the Priorities USA Action ad consists of statements by Trump dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus. As we have written, Trump made a series of such statements from Jan. 22 to March 10, and as recently as March 24 likened the disease’s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents.
The ad has Trump saying, “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China.” That’s what Trump told CNBC in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22.
The ad continues with Trump saying, “One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear.” That’s what Trump told a gathering of African American leaders at a meeting on Feb. 27.
The next quote is, “When you have 15 people and within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” Trump said this at a press conference on Feb. 26.
“We really think we’ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum.” Trump said that at the same press conference.
The ad also quotes Trump: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it.” Trump said this, referring to medical issues, during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 6.
And finally, the ad quotes Trump saying, “No, I don’t take responsibility at all.” That’s what the president said at a press conference on March 13 when asked if he took responsibility for the federal government’s lag in testing for the coronavirus.
So the overwhelming bulk of the ad is on target. But the beginning is deceptive.",Rem Rieder,2020-04-14 0:00:00,misleading,,mix,False,"The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action has been running an ad falsely suggesting President Donald Trump called the coronavirus outbreak a “hoax.”
At the beginning, the ad splices together two quotes to have Trump saying, “The coronavirus, this is their new hoax.” It is obvious in listening to the ad that he said, “The coronavirus,” and, “this is their new hoax,” at different times. Later in the rally, he referred to the coronavirus criticism as the Democrats’ “single talking point.”
“A virus starts in China, bleeds its way into various countries all around the world, doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats’ single talking point, and you see it, is that it’s Donald Trump’s fault, right?

287,Misinformation on Coronavirus Death Toll,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/01/misinformation-on-coronavirus-death-toll/,,"4.8KQuick Take
Websites and social media posts have circulated the erroneous claim that there are “thousands” or “10,000” dead as a result of the Wuhan coronavirus. As of early Jan. 27, the estimated death toll is 81 — all of them in China.


Full Story 
As health officials around the world grapple with the outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus that has spread from Wuhan, China, online misinformation has spread about the number of deaths related to the new virus.
The number of confirmed cases of the virus worldwide numbered 2,886 and the total confirmed deaths stood at 81 — all of them in China — as of early Jan. 27, according to data collected and mapped by Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The data is drawn from sources such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and China’s National Health Commission.
The Hubei province in China, which includes Wuhan, has so far reported 76 deaths.
Those figures stand in stark contrast to social media posts and online stories that have erroneously claimed the number of fatalities is actually in the thousands.
The Geller Report, a website run by anti-Islamic activist Pamela Geller, for example, published and spread a headline reading: “CORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China.”
But the story links to one “unconfirmed” report that is actually just hearsay on a website about gold and metals, jsmineset.com, which has a disclaimer that says it can’t vouch for the “accuracy or completeness” of its information.
Jsmineset.com published an email on Jan. 24 from someone named “Robert,” who wrote: “I just received a call from a close American friend of mine who just got off the phone with a Chinese friend, who has relatives in Wuhan. He says there may already be ~10,000 dead there from the virus.” The email offers no other evidence for the claim.
Likewise, some Facebook users shared a post that claimed — without any sourcing — that the “CORONAVIRUS MUCH WORSE THAN YOU’RE BEING TOLD – THOUSANDS DEAD,” and regurgitated the falsehood that there is an existing patent for the new coronavirus — which we’ve previously debunked.
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that often cause respiratory illnesses in humans and other illnesses in animals, according to the CDC. The new coronavirus is being referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV.
The U.S., to date, has five confirmed cases of the virus.

288,Misinformation About Face Masks,https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/scicheck-misinformation-about-face-masks/,,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a raging — sometimes ill-informed — debate over the effectiveness of face masks as protection against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Lab tests, for example, show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads. Analyses of people who came into contact with those with COVID-19 have also found mask-wearing to be associated with a reduced risk of contracting the virus. Numerous studies similarly document an association between self-reported mask wearing and control of the virus in a community or the implementation of a mask mandate and a subsequent decline in COVID-19 cases.
While each of these study types has its limitations, collectively, most experts agree that masks are likely to reduce transmission of the coronavirus and should be used by members of the public when around other people. Some research also indicates face masks can protect the wearer as well.
Masks, however, should not be viewed as fool-proof, as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others. For optimal performance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people select masks that are well-fitting and multi-layered. For more, see our SciCheck story, “The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.”

Initially, there was limited evidence to support broad masking policies for the general public, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended masks only for those infected and medical providers treating them. On April 3, 2020, the CDC reversed course and recommended that everyone wear face coverings in public, citing new data that showed a “significant portion” of people infected with the coronavirus lack symptoms but can spread the virus to others. 
Since then, a growing body of evidence supports the use of masks to slow the spread of COVID-19, as we reported in March. 
Numerous lab studies, for example, show that high-quality, well-fitting masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets, which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads — and may offer some protection to the wearer. In one CDC study, N95 respirators performed the best in preventing the spread of particles from a simulated cough — blocking 99% of the particles — while medical masks blocked 59% and a cloth mask blocked 51%. (See SciCheck’s “The Evolving Science of Face Masks and COVID-19.”)
But the effectiveness of masks is now being challenged again — fueled, in part, by contradictory signals sent by the CDC.
On May 13, the CDC updated its guidance to say “fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in any setting.” But two months later, with COVID-19 cases on the rise and the delta variant becoming dominant in the U.S., the CDC changed course again — recommending “fully vaccinated people to wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission.”
With each decision, federal health officials have said mask guidelines are based on the “evolution of the science,” as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, once put it.
The evolving science also has offered an opportunity for those peddling misinformation to distort the facts at every turn.
“It’s not healthy for these students to be sitting there all day, 6-year-old kids in kindergarten covered in masks,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a July 28 speech in Utah, repeating an unsubstantiated health claim that we debunked before.
On Aug. 11, Sen. Rand Paul was kicked off YouTube for a week after making inaccurate claims about the effectiveness of face masks. “Most of the masks you get over the counter don’t work. They don’t prevent infection,” Paul said in the video, citing as evidence a Danish study that, as we wrote last year, has been distorted by critics of mask mandates.
In reviewing our work on masking, we have found that false and misleading claims about face masks tend to fall into four categories of misinformation: distortions of science, misrepresentation of government guidance, claims that mask-wearing has been proven to be ineffective and claims that mask-wearing increases your health risk.
There is some overlap of categories. For example, claims that distort scientific research do so to conclude, incorrectly, that masks have proven to be ineffective or even dangerous.
Below we summarize some of our work over the past 16 months, based on the categories of misinformation about masking.

Distortions of Science/Mask-Wearing Proven to Be Ineffective
CDC study distorted to claim masks have ‘negligible impact’ 
Claim: Some conservative outlets and social media users in March falsely claimed that the CDC found face masks have a “negligible impact” on COVID-19 outcomes and that mask mandates “made no statistical difference.”
Facts: The CDC study actually found that state-issued mask mandates were associated with significant decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates. The findings supported the premise that mask requirements help limit the potential exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which therefore reduces the spread of the disease, COVID-19. 
The study found that mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease in daily COVID-19 case growth rates within the first 20 days. The reductions in growth rates increased with time, reaching 1.8 percentage points within 81 to 100 days after implementation.
Yet, conservative outlets claimed the CDC said masks had “little” impact, wrongly equating the decrease in the growth rate of daily cases and deaths with a decrease in the number of cases and deaths.
“Because the growth rate is exponential,” the impact compounds, José Luis Jiménez, an analytical and atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved in the study, told us. “So, it’s kind of like your mortgage — you change your interest a little bit, and then you save a ton of money. Because the cases compound.”

Danish study didn’t prove masks ‘don’t work’
Claim: News of the results of a randomized controlled trial in Denmark testing a face mask intervention led some to wrongly conclude that masks are ineffective against the coronavirus. Social media posts, for example, cited the study to claim that the trial “proves masks offer NO protection from COVID” or that masks “don’t work.”
Facts: Scientists say that’s the wrong takeaway — and even the authors of the study say the results shouldn’t be interpreted to mean masks shouldn’t be worn.
The Danish trial was published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Nov. 18 along with two editorials to provide more context to the findings.

The trial evaluated whether giving free surgical masks to volunteers and recommending their use safeguarded wearers from infection with the coronavirus, in addition to other public health recommendations. The study didn’t identify a statistically significant protective effect for wearers, but the trial was only designed to detect a large effect of 50% or more. And the study didn’t weigh in on the ability of masks to prevent spread of the virus from wearers to others, or what’s known as source control, which is thought to be the primary way that masks work.
As a result, the most that can be said is that this particular study didn’t find that the face mask intervention had a large protective effect for wearers — not that masks provide no protection at all or don’t offer benefits to others. And at the time, Danish authorities were not recommending masks to the general public, so most people in the trial were likely to have encounters with non-mask wearers.

Fauci followed science, CDC recommendations on masking  
Claim: “Fauci lied” about face masks when he wrote in a Feb. 5, 2020 email that “[masks] are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection.”
Facts: Fauci’s public statements early in the pandemic on masking have been repeatedly distorted. His remarks on masks throughout the pandemic have been consistent with what was known at the time about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.   
The Feb. 5, 2020, email, which was released in response to journalists’ Freedom of Information Act requests, was written before the CDC had begun recommending the use of face masks for the general public. At that early point in the pandemic, the CDC recommended face masks for health care workers and those who had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms.
On April 3, the CDC reversed its earlier position and announced that it would recommend that people wear face coverings in public, citing new studies on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.
So, Fauci’s email was consistent with public guidance at the time. He was also being consistent when Fauci told “60 Minutes” in March 2020 that “masks are important for someone who’s infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.”

Misrepresenting findings on use of personal protective measures
Claim: In a viral video, former television journalist Ben Swann misleadingly argued that face masks have been proven to be ineffective in stopping the spread of COVID-19, citing 2019 and 2020 studies that he claimed showed “there was no significant difference by wearing N95 respirator masks.”
Facts: The 2019 study looked at the effect of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks to prevent health care workers from getting the flu and “other viral respiratory infections in geographically diverse, high-exposure, outpatient settings.” It did not examine the use of masks as source control for containing the spread of a virus in the general population. It also didn’t include a group of study subjects who didn’t wear masks at all, so the outcomes of those who wore surgical masks or N95 respirators can’t be compared with outcomes for non-mask wearers.
The 2020 “study” is actually a review of several studies.
It included only one study that wasn’t focused on health care workers. Published in 2009, that study looked at the use of masks in households with a sick child and found that if masks aren’t used regularly and correctly, they won’t be effective in controlling the spread of seasonal viruses. “However,” the study found, “during a severe pandemic when use of face masks might be greater, pandemic transmission in households could be reduced.”

Distortions of Science/Mask-Wearing Increases Health Risk
Bogus ‘study’ — later retracted — gives rise to false claims of harm 
Claim: In April, viral headlines wrongly claimed that a “Stanford Study” proved that masks are ineffective and dangerous. Among other things, the paper said that masks “restrict breathing, causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.” Hypoxemia is the term for insufficient oxygen in the blood; hypercapnia is the presence of too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. 
Facts: The paper cited in the viral claims was not an original “study,” but one person’s hypothesis — or proposed explanation — based on a review of some previous literature. It was first published online in November by the journal Medical Hypotheses, but was later retracted by the journal’s publisher, which apologized to readers. 
As for the accusation that masks cause unsafe oxygen levels, experts have repeatedly rebuffed that claim.
“For many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions,” the Mayo Clinic Health System notes. “The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks while in public, and this option is very breathable.”

Unsupported claim on facial deformities
Claim: In a Feb. 11 video live-streamed on Facebook and viewed more than 70,000 times, chiropractor Eric Nepute rattles off a list of 20 arguments against wearing face masks, including this distortion: “Facial deformities. Masking children triggers mouth breathing, which has been shown to cause narrowing of the face, narrowing of the mouth, high vaults in the palate, dental malocclusions — and the list goes on and on. This is according to the Journal of General Dentistry. They say you shouldn’t wear one.”
Facts: Nepute — who in April was charged by the Federal Trade Commission with violating consumer protection laws by deceptively marketing products to treat or prevent COVID-19 — is referring to the Academy of General Dentistry’s journal, which did not say not to wear a mask. The report being referenced didn’t evaluate masks at all.
Instead, the 2009 report looked at the implications of mouth breathing in children.










Credit: Kelly Sikkema/Unsplash
Dr. Callan White, a dentist and national spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry, told us that the video’s claim requires “several jumps.” There is no scientific evidence showing that children resort to exclusively breathing through their mouth while wearing a mask, he said, and that they do so for long enough to mirror children who experience chronic mouth breathing.
“Children who suffer from these conditions aren’t able to breathe through their nose at all, or very little, at all times. This condition creates the most harmful effects at night while the child is sleeping,” he said. “There is a significant difference in frequency and duration of the habit” of mouth breathing due to wearing a mask.
False claim about masks causing ‘bacterial infections’
Claim: Nepute also wrongly claimed that “oh, by the way, that’s the No. 1 thing that killed everybody during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Not the virus, but the bacterial infections. These masks are causing this.”
Facts: In 2008, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases published a study that found that most deaths from the 1918 flu pandemic likely resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia after contracting the flu.
“The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,” the National Institutes of Health said in a release explaining the study.
So to suggest the flu wasn’t involved in those deaths is wrong. Furthermore, that study made no mention of masks.

Gas detector ‘test’ reaches flawed conclusion
Claim: In a video, Jeff Neff — a firefighter and president of the borough council in Sewickley, Pennsylvania — used a device for detecting gas levels to wrongly suggest that face masks reduce oxygen levels to dangerous levels.
Facts: Thomas Fuller, a professor of health sciences at Illinois State University who reviewed the video for FactCheck.org, told us Neff was wrongly measuri
